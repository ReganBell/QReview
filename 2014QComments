EXPOS 20.274: Democracy in the Digital Age</title>Wonderful class to take if you want to learn about application of digital communication tools on democracy. Don't expect a sweeping, thorough overview of all methods though.</comment>If you're interested in government you will really like this course.</comment>Yascha is a great teacher who leads lively discussions. Definitely take this if you have an interest in politics/government: do much of the class is spent on it it might as well count as a gov class. However, don't expect your writing to improve leaps and bounds, especially if you don't put full effort into the class. Definitely take this class if you already have strong political beliefs: you will have the opportunity to argument your political opinions.</comment>The class is not bad and is a reasonable class for fulfilling the expos requirement, but the material is really dry if you're not interested in the nitty-gritty aspects of government and democracy. Other expos classes could be better, but this class was definitely not the worst.</comment>This is a very good class for expos. It was interesting when we talked about the effect of social media on social revolutions. Towards the end of the course, however, we talked more about fringe democratic proposals like liquid democracy that go a little boring.</comment>Yascha is an awesome teacher and I would definitely recommend it. The first part of the course is fairly boring because it focuses entirely on democracy and nothing about technology but the rest of the course is extremely interesting. I definitely believe I am a far better writer after this class.</comment>Not the most exciting of the Expos selections in terms of content/reading selections, but the preceptor is very, very knowledgable and has a lot of good advice/suggesions on how to improve your writing style.</comment>Democracy in the Digital Age is a fantastic choice. Yascha is a brilliant writer and a great guy. He makes an effort to get to know every student personally, and will work with you one-on-one to improve your writing. For each of the three papers you'll write in this class, Yascha will sit down with you for informal conferences in a café to guide you through the process. If you're at all interested in technology, government, or the intersection between the two, this class is a thought-provoking, enjoyable way to fulfill your Expos requirement.</comment>Take this course if you want a good Expos experience! The essays are difficult but rewarding, the readings are good, and Yascha is awesome.</comment>Make sure that you're very interested in government, and don't expect too much focus on technology.</comment></course>ANTHRO 1640: Language and Culture</title>I loved this class. It was challenging, but I learned so much. Professor Harkness is brilliant! He is incredibly knowledgeable about this material and his passion for it comes through in every lecture. He is always engaging and will make sure that you are engaged too. The readings are crucial and not overbearing, so they are not hard to do. Overall a great class that I wish I could take again.</comment>Very difficult course but the material is interesting. The lectures can be very eye opening if you have read the texts carefully.</comment>The reading can be very very confusing. I feel like the way I view language and culture has changed in this course, but still in a way I don't fully comprehend myself. There is a ton of complicated vocabulary in this course that the teaching staff seems to combine and throw out at random which can extremely difficult to grasp.</comment>The good: fascinating topic, great readings, fun papers, pretty useful lectures.  The bad: a professor who doesn't always seem to want to help you to understand what he is saying (i.e. lots of jargon, defensive answers to probing questions, obscurantism, use of language to form a hermetic seal against the possibility of being proved wrong), along with many readings full of inflationary language.</comment>If you have even the slightest interest in the relationship between language and culture, then this is the course for you. Professor Harkness is an amazing lecturer and you will feel like you understand the universe on a deeper level when you hear him speak. Sections with Vivien are tons of fun and she is amazing at facilitating discussion and enthusiasm (seriously, one hour is not enough time when you talk with Vivien). The readings are super interesting (SO READ THEM) and I am not exaggerating when I say that I totally have left this class with a new-found understanding of language and culture. Assignments can be a bit difficult (there were only three essays) but totally forces you to think about everything you have learned in the course.</comment>This class was challenging, but fantastic, enlightening, and well worth the effort.  Don't be scared by the challenge--this class is introductory, and though previous experience in anthropology helps, it is definitely not necessary (I didn't have any).  I enjoyed it immensely and recommend it to anyone at all interested in anthropology.</comment>Make sure to do the readings every week, and come to section prepared with specific questions. This class is very much dependent upon your own commitment -- if you put a lot in, you'll get a lot out.</comment>I would say that the only way to really enjoy the class is to have a genuine interest in the connection between language and how people see its function in different societies. The readings can be really technical and almost impossible to get through, but I would say that it's been the most rewarding course I've taken. Vivien is a great tf, and helps make the material much more accessible. Prof. Harkness is great, and his lectures are fantastic.</comment></course>DRAMA 172x: China on Stage</title>Claire has had so many interesting stories accrued throughout her career as an academic and professor. She loves what she studies, teaching, and her students-- a very rare combination for an instructor! Definitely start your papers early and ask her for guidance. She's very busy but answers her email very quickly. It's also good to go into the papers with a well-formulated question on your own, as I felt like she didn't provide a lot of direction in that area.</comment>Definitely take this class if you have an interest in art/theatre and are looking for a way to experience a new culture. The amount of reading is very doable, as is the amount of writing. You will get a lot out of the course!</comment>This course is absolutely amazing, and Professor Conceison is such a vibrant, wonderful teacher who has so much firsthand knowledge of the subject, having studied it in China with some of the most important figures in Chinese theater today and has written and studied so much about it. You cannot miss the chance to take a course with her; you will learn so much and will come out of it with a new perspective on drama and a deeper understanding of literature, theater, and Chinese society. This class is challenging in the sense that you will learn a lot and the subject may be pretty new to you, but it is still accessible and really interesting - which is in my opinion the perfect kind of challenging. The plays are sometimes hilarious, and sometimes heartbreaking, and through reading them, discussing them as a group over snacks, reading literary criticism, watching them, getting to ask questions of the playwrights themselves(!), and performing them with each other, you will understand them more deeply than you ever thought possible but will still realize you have so much more to learn. This was the most interesting class I ever took at Harvard, and I am so glad I made the decision to take it. YOU MUST TAKE THIS CLASS. I guarantee you will love it.</comment></course>ECON 2059: Decision Theory</title>The course is really hard. To fully understand the course proficient math is required. So, if you are not good at math, then do not take the course. Some knowledge of topology would be helpful. Prepare to spend a lot of time on home assignments, and read through lecture notes and different papers for several time to understand at least something. Apart from being extremely difficult, the course is marvelous, and Tomasz is a great teacher, always helpful and always available for questions after class, and during the office hours.</comment>Very interesting and thorough introduction to decision theory.</comment>If you are interested in doing research in decision theory, this course is your starting point. If you are interested in behavioral economics or experimental economics or other parts of microeconomic theory or even mathematical psychology, you should definitely at least attend this course.</comment></course>NEUROBIO 220: Cellular Neurophysiology</title>I'd recommend people working with neurophysiology to take this class. It seems no matter what level you are in, you'll still have something to learn here. The professors are really nice to discuss with, even about your own research.</comment>This course is a LOT of work and requires extensive amount of time and energy! A strong background in neuroscience is not required, but would be very helpful. A supplementary textbook may also be helpful if you don't understand concepts from class.</comment>This course is not perfect, but it's as good as it can get. Take it.</comment>I learned more from this class in 3 months than I learned in 3 years in a neurophysiology lab. It was totally awesome dude.</comment>I enjoyed this class a lot! A rigorous and comprehensive introduction to the subject.</comment>challenging but worth it at the end</comment>Nice equilibrated class, which starts with a bit of biophysics and ends on solid, modern techniques in neurophysiology.</comment></course>AFRAMER 20: Introduction to African Languages and Cultures</title>A very good class that makes you think in a new way about something as simple as language. It introduces you to many new perspectives on something you may have only thought about in one way.</comment>Completely changed my perspective on African culture. Truly a great class. Professor Mugane is a genius and Lowell was a great TF. Social engagement project is also a lot of fun.</comment>Prof. Mugane's lectures are very engaging, and Lowell as a TF engages with the material and the students very well. I really enjoyed the readings and the types of questions we were asked to consider in the course. It felt important and relevant.</comment>Really cool class. Would especially recommend as a first introduction to African studies. You don't really consider how important the language question is before taking it, and it's fantastic at blowing up former false preconceptions. Readings in the second half of the course are definitely less interesting but the middle portion of the class in particular is fascinating</comment>If you're curious about the African continent, like languages, or are fascinated about other cultures, definitely take this class.</comment>Really cool course and Mugane and Lowell are both really awesome instructors</comment>great course that deals directly with the language question! Lowell is simply the best TF</comment>TAKE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</comment>Definitely take it! Prof. Mugane is a great guy and is very knowledgeable, as is the TF Lowell Brower. The workload isn't too intense and the discussions are amazing.</comment>If you stay on top of the subject matter and coursework, this class will be one of the most rewarding yet.</comment>Take the class. It will pay off dividends, especially if this doesn't seem like a class that you previously thought you would ever take.</comment></course>CHNSE 130a: Pre-Advanced Modern Chinese</title>Once again, the Chinese department at Harvard proves it is one of the best departments at the school. If you're taking 130, by now you should know exactly what to expect from Chinese at Harvard: the teachers are excellent, the assignments are difficult and plentiful but never overwhelming, and the tingxies are tingxies.</comment>This class is great. Boring but you learn Chinese.</comment>This is a great course if you're looking to expand upon your Chinese speaking and reading skills. It has a similar format to Chinese 120 and consists of a lot of vocabulary and grammar memorization, but it is helpful if you want to pursue learning Mandarin. It is not an overly rigorous course and not the best if you're looking to only focus on oral skills.</comment>You should be willing to put in consistent amount of work throughout the semester. As long as you stay on top of everything, this course won't be difficult at all.</comment>You need to put in consistent effort to make it worthwhile (which the teachers do a good job of making sure/encouraging you do)</comment>I love the laoshis! It was always such a lovely way to start the day, even if Vanserg is in the middle of nowhere.</comment>Great course, especially drill section. Similar to the other Chinese courses before it, except Hu Laoshi is the bomb (and he helps you during dictations). It wasn't so hard for me once I got into a good routine, and I felt it was a nice break from doing readings or psets from other classes.</comment>Language is a skill you won't regret learning, and here you can learn it without it being a pain (you'll enjoy it!).</comment>The class will teach you the Chinese you want to know.  However, be warned: this class takes up an extraordinary amount of time (just like most language classes, but especially with Asian languages).  I took this course (and 120b) with a five class schedule, and it was absolute hell in terms of workload.  But the class is effective, so that made up for the pressure.  If you want to take 130 (or any Chinese class), don't load up on courses.</comment>There's a fair amount of work to this class, but it is well rewarded: you will come out with a much better grasp of Chinese reading and writing. This course has been another great semester in Harvard's amazing Chinese language program; I have taken a Chinese class every semester I've been here, and it's always been one of my best-taught and favorite courses every semester.</comment>Chinese 130a is a very enjoyable and manageable class. It's not hard but you have to put time into studying for tests and tingxie. The teachers are great!</comment>DO IT.</comment>Chinese 130a is an incredible class. We learn so much new vocabulary and grammar in just a semester and develop an enriched understanding of the issues facing contemporary China.</comment>This class is a great continuation of chinese studies</comment>It's a class that took a lot of my time but I was always happy to go to class and drill sections, which says a lot compared to most of my other classes.</comment>Be prepared to work hard + learn a lot!</comment>If you've already done 120, there's no reason not to take this class! The grammar is a bit more complicated and the texts are a bit more in-depth but all-in-all it's a very natural transition from 120. Take it!</comment>Lots of work, but well worth it. Keep on top of the work!</comment>stay on top of your assignments</comment>The vocabulary is pretty hard. But the course and instructors are fantastic. People who came straight to Chinese 130 rather than after Ba Bb 120a 120b seemed to struggle a little in the beginning because the teachers here focused a lot on tones in Ba Bb 120a 120b.</comment>If you've taken Chinese before at Harvard, you know what you're in for - a fantastic class in basically every way. While harder than 120, it's not an unreasonable step-up - if you had a good grasp of the 120 material, the only thing you really have to work hard on and might present a challenge is speaking and listening skills.</comment>Chinese 130a is absolutely a worthwhile class! More so than ever before, it focuses on topics that are extremely relevant, interesting, timely, and even a little controversial. You'll learn to discuss issues like Chinese economic issues, pollution and ways to reduce it, marriage and dating, food safety, copyright infringement disputes, etc. The grammar points are very well taught and well structured. Of course, most importantly, the teaching staff of this class are all absolutely phenomenal, some of the most friendly, accessible, talented, and helpful teachers you'll find in the Chinese department!</comment></course>LATIN Bam: Latin Prose Selections (Late Antique and Medieval)</title>Make sure that you will be able to allocate between one and three hours (depending upon your Latin prowess) per translation assignment. The course loses its value if you don't attempt the translations on your own.</comment>This is an extremely intensive course, and needs a lot of hard work. But it's also extremely effective, so if you're really trying to improve your Latin, it's an excellent choice. It's also a good opportunity to read bits of authors like Bede or Abelard or Petrarch in the original, as they're often read in translation in literature courses.</comment></course>COMPSCI 261: Research Topics in Operating Systems</title>This is an awesome class and knowledge gained from the class brings you to a whole new level of understanding about computing.</comment>I don't think Margo knows how to make an easy course—this one is easier than 161 but still very tough. There's two ~12 page conference papers (about 25 pages as a double-spaced Word document) to read every class, which does get tiring. Most of the papers are very good though, and you'll learn lots of the hip systems research topics and where they are now. You'll also learn to examine research papers critically, take away the big ideas, and see the connections between various different research topics.  Then you'll do your own research project, in addition to the readings. This project is really what you make of it, but if you want to have a good project you'll have to put in a lot of time here. Interestingly, what code you write is not so important here—it's all about the writing and presentation of the results (you'll likely have to write code to get results, though!).  Overall, this is a great course and will really help you get acquainted with the state of systems research. If you're at all interested/intrigued by systems, research, and have room in your schedule, it's definitely worth taking this class.</comment>You really have to spend time on it and pay effort. This is the only that the course helps you improve.</comment></course>SAS 100r: South Asian Language Tutorials</title>Indonesian language tutorial is a great opportunity to learn one of the most spoken languages in the world in an intimate setting, where you don't have to feel uncomfortable or like the class is leaving you behind.</comment>A great course to take if you have spent time in South Asia or are interested in working there on day.</comment>Practice using the language as much as possible. You get lots of opportunities to do this in class.</comment></course>BCMP 200: Molecular Biology</title>This class covered a huge amount of material in laundry list fashion, without any unifying principles or clear take home messages. It was a huge amount of work and yet in the end I learned little. Taking this class was an exceedingly painful experience and you should avoid it if at all possible.</comment>This class is not worth spending your time on, unless you are deeply interested in molecular biology as your field of research.</comment>Great overview and in-depth case studies spanning a wide range of modern molecular biology. Outstanding coverage of up-to-date findings and game changing genomic approaches.</comment>The quality of lecturers and assignments varies immensely throughout the course, and while the chalk talks are useful, the problem sets and quizzes are a time suck.</comment>I did not learn anything new from this course except for how to aptly present a chalk talk. I think that the chalk talk alone is enough reason to take this course, plus I keep hearing that this will help me with my PQEs, though that remains to be seen.</comment>This course is good to get a good exposure to the most recent questions and discoveries in molecular biology.</comment>If you're interested in molecular biology it's a good foundation.  Since it's in modules it's also good that if one topic/lecturer is difficult for you, then in a few weeks it changes so there will be some pieces that are really enjoyable.  Also it's not ridiculously demanding so you learn without constantly stressing.</comment>Only take if absolutely have no background in the material.</comment>I think some modules of the course were great while others were not. Overall I think I learned something so I would probably recommend it but I would say that some parts are terrible.</comment>I would tell them not to let BBS program tell them it's useful for the PQE. However I would tell them the class is useful to connect with fellow classmates but academically will not add them much.</comment>It is more useful for consolidating knowledge that has been gained at the undergraduate level. It is difficult for a beginner/undergraduate with little or no background understanding but easy for a graduate student who has had at least a rigorous course in molecular biology and biochemistry.</comment>Some lecturers were great, others were not. Problem sets were mostly fair. Discussion section was very helpful in learning the techniques taught in class.</comment>Teaches you fundamentals of molecular biology; chalktalk was a big help in training us to give presentations</comment>You don't have to put in much work, but you won't learn a whole lot either</comment>The class is a great introduction to major molecular biological techniques and concepts that can be applicable to most any subfield of biology.</comment>a lot of it is review from undergrad and sometimes not helpful, but other parts of the class talking about new techniques was interesting and good to know</comment></course>FRSEMR 49n: Measurements of the Mind: The Creation and Critique of the Psychological Test</title>This is the best seminar you can take. You actively take multiple psychological tests, watch multiple videos, and go to a couple museums throughout the semesters. Mrs. Eby is a bonafide saint; she'll give you extensions on your response papers (they aren't arduous) if you have multiple things going on, and she'll keep the 2 hour period interesting. I had no prior interest in psychology going into the course, but now I have a real appreciation of the field.</comment>This seminar is really interesting. There is a lot of reading, but the professor is really great! You will learn a lot about psychological testing, and the general history of psychology by taking this course.</comment>It isn't necessary to read all the readings because Dr. Eby goes through most of it during class but definitely stay engaged in class.</comment>It's an easy course, so you'll get out of it what you put into it.</comment>Marla Eby is a very kind professor who clearly knows a lot about the topic of the course. She has a lot to say and class is primarily lecture based, but usually very interesting if you like psychology.</comment>Professor Eby leads very interesting discussions about very cool topics!</comment>It is interesting but easy.</comment></course>EXPOS 20.101: The Voice of Authority</title>This class is quite demanding but it is incredibly rewarding. Jane is one of the most remarkable people I've ever known in my life.</comment>"The Voice Of Authority" might not be the easiest Expos class but you will you learn so much from it: not only will you improve your writing skills but also will you read a super interesting novel, short stories enlightened by a meeting with the author and Definitely rank this Expos class your first choice</comment>Expos is generally a lot of work, and this course is no exception. However, if you put the work into this class, you'll emerge a much stronger writer.</comment>It is a lot of work in small bursts.</comment>Take this class if at all possible! Jane is an amazing preceptor and loves both the material and her students. She's incredibly smart and makes sure the class is fun and instructive at the same time.</comment>That even though it is a very difficult course, it's worth it because Jane is incredible and helps so much with writing.</comment>Jans is an extremely enthusiastic preceptor who makes class engaging and genuinely wants to help you learn how to write well. The reading in this class are great. The assignments are often annoying and don't seem to give enough benefit for the amount of time they take. The workload is not very well spread-out, so most of the time you will have very little to do, while a couple times a month it will be overwhelming. I personally, did not find Jane to be that harsh of a grader.</comment>Jane Unrue reminds me of Ms. Frizzle from the Magic School Bus. She is extremely enthusiastic and encouraging about everything. She really valued what each person has to say.</comment>As far as Expos classes go, this class might be the best option. The material in the course excellent--you read "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," a series of short stories from exiled writers that I probably would not have ever encountered if not for this class, and then you research a topic of your choice (really anything from the Supreme Court to Kanye West), not a given in most Expos classes. The instructor, Jane, and the class itself is also excellent. Jane has a lot of fun, quirky energy and will make a potentially slumberous subject engaging. You will also learn a lot from her; she's been teaching expos for a long time and will push your writing abilities, no matter your background. She also gives the class a fair amount of freedom for the in-class discussions, making the day-to-day of the class genuinely interesting. Though it might be slightly more work than other Expos classes, I highly, highly recommend this one.</comment>I learned so much and became a much stronger writer because of how dedicated Jane is to teaching us. Her feedback was always helpful and detailed, and was more than happy to read multiple intro revisions. Her enthusiasm was infectious and every second in class was a delight.</comment>This course is not the course to take if you simply want to fulfill your expos requirement as easily as possible, because it certainly isn't the easiest expos class. However, I believe this course does a great job at achieving the desired goal of the expository writing requirement: it will teach you to be a more thoughtful, analytical writer.</comment>Almost guaranteed that you've never had someone teach writing as well as Jane does. More than my friends in other Expos classes, I can detect a huge difference between my first draft and my last paper.</comment>It's a lot of work, but it's worth it!!!</comment>This class is amazing. I was shocked that an Expos class could be my favorite course of freshman fall, but it was. Jane teaches with enthusiasm and inspires you to be a great writer. Our readings were fantastic and I loved reading and meeting an at-risk scholar. Highly recommended class.</comment>Be prepared to be pushed to improve your writing - but also be prepared to become much better at analysis and structuring your papers!</comment></course>HISTSCI 235: Current Topics in the Social Study of the Life Sciences</title>Senior history of science concentrators would get a lot out of this course, especially if they plan to apply to graduate school. I highly recommend this class!</comment>Prof. Roosth is brilliant, fantastic, and welcoming. This was her first time teaching the course, so the syllabus will change somewhat by the time she teaches it next, but I enjoyed most of the readings and the discussions. You have quite a bit of latitude in choosing a topic for the final research paper.</comment>Sophia does a great job leading discussions, but she typically won't call on you so it is important to speak up if you want to contribute to the discussion. Be sure to meet with her outside of class both about the paper assignments and the presentation. She provides incredibly helpful feedback during office hours.</comment>Current issues, strong syllabus, stellar professor. Highly recommend!</comment></course>HISTSCI 134: Nature on Display</title>This is an absolutely fantastic class that will not require very much from you.</comment>Even if you're not a History of Science concentrator, do not hesitate to take this class! It's extremely interesting and accessible to people of all backgrounds, and you'll be introduced to fascinating issues on the interaction between nature, science, and material culture.</comment>Great class. Valuable for HS concentraters and people who want to explore the field. Also Janet is the best!</comment>best class you'll take at harvard!</comment>This was a fascinating and fun seminar taught by an excellent professor. I would recommend it to students interested in museums, animals, and natural history whether or not they are concentrating in the History of Science.</comment>This is an absolutely fantastic class. If you are thinking about taking it, just take it. Readings are light and enjoyable, the discussion is fantastic, and the midterm paper and final project are both VERY manageable, as well as enjoyable to complete. Professor Browne is an absolute delight. TAKE THIS CLASS.</comment>TAKE THIS CLASS!!! Prof. Browne is amazing and so thoughtful. This class was also crafted so well. If you have any interest in the history of the intersection of Humans and Nature (you talk about everything from national parks to museums to botany), take this class. Especially if you have interest in human/wildlife conflict, relations, pets, zoos, trophy hunting...basically if you love talking about humans and animals, this will be the best class you have taken at Harvard. You also get to travel to so many different cool locations on campus: the natural history museum, the botany library to name a few. The best part is you don't have to be OEB or science-minded. I took this class as an English major and it was probably one of the most compelling and thought-provoking classroom experiences I have ever had. And the readings are entirely doable. Seriously. Take this class.</comment>Extremely interesting subject matter and a very manageable amount of reading and written work. Professor Browne has so much enthusiasm for the subject and it makes for great group discussions.</comment></course>HIST 1602: China's Long 20th Century</title>Professor Koll is an absolutely incredible lecturer, and she generates so much enthusiasm for a topic that might not otherwise be the most exciting. If you have any interest in Chinese history, or just understanding China's current sociopolitical situation, take this class!</comment>This course is a must if you aren't particularly familiar with Chinese history, because it provides you with great background to understand the position of China in the world today. Professor Koll and Peter were great. Though lectures weren't always organized in the clearest fashion, section cleared up the details, and the primary source documents were fascinating. The grading is very fair, especially for a humanities course, and the assignments were interesting.</comment>It's a good course on the history of China in the 20th century.</comment>Keep up with readings</comment>Truly a great class. Excellent lectures and sections--definitely take if you have any interest in Chinese history.</comment>This is a really fantastic course! Professor Koll is a very engaging lecturer who cares a lot about students in the class. The class really gives you a better understanding of modern China. Readings and writing assignments were fair and Peter did a great job as our TF.</comment>I consider myself somewhat of a Chinese history buff, but before taking this class I knew relatively little about modern Chinese history. Professor Koll is one of the most engaging instructors I have had here and the material was fascinating and informative. There is nothing about this course that would keep me from recommending it.</comment>You should have:
Enthusiasm and curiosity about China! Open-mindedness to put yourself in the shoes of the "other." Critical analysis skills which you will further develop and critical synthesis skills which Chen Village and Spider Eaters (primary sources) in particular hone. 
Also, talk to Professor Koll and Peter are marvelous and you really learn so much from their first hand accounts in those countries.</comment>I came into this course knowing nothing of Chinese history and feeling quite out of my comfort zone. Professor Koll's lectures were wonderful about no presuming prior knowledge without lowering the complexity of the material. The entire course was well thought out and easy to follow. All of the course components--the lectures, the sections, the readings and the assignments--overlapped nicely to create a cohesive picture. The course was challenging, but doable in a large part thanks to the people involved. This is such a solid class.</comment>This was a fantastic class that I thoroughly enjoyed. I came in with no Chinese history knowledge looking to gain some, and this course was great for understanding what happened in China and why they happened. The assignments are great; this class, with a low workload and very interesting topic, was a pleasure to be enrolled in</comment>Great class, Professor Koll is fantastic</comment>This class gives an excellent perspective on the major themes and developments within China during the 20th century. It gives one an excellent foundation for understanding China today. Professor Koll is a fantastic lecturer, and is one of the more engaging and better teachers I've had at Harvard. Take this course.</comment>This course is great if you have a background in chinese history. Otherwise, it can be a struggle to understand all the primary sources. Lectures are fantastic though, and the teaching staff is amazing.</comment>Fantastic introduction to modern Chinese history that helps you gain much more insight and understanding of China today. Professor Koll is a fantastic instructor who consistently gives compelling, entertaining, and interactive lectures.</comment>I adored this course! If this is offered, take it while you have the chance! Elizabeth Koll is a lovely professor and all of her lectures are both interesting and passionate. This is a real treat to take, and the workload isn't too difficult.</comment>Great class. The lectures and sections are fantastic. I had never studied any part of Chinese history before and I found this class to be really interesting. It's one of the best classes I've taken at Harvard.</comment>A history tutorial of some sort would have helped me a lot. Although I felt that I knew a lot about modern China, lacking a background in historical analysis made the course more difficult for me than I thought it would. That being said, Professor Koll and our TF Peter were very helpful during office hours.</comment>One of the best courses I have ever taken. Professor Koll is perhaps the most engaging instructor that I have had at Harvard. She is passionate about this subject and is so accessible. Everyone should take a course on China, and this is the one to take.</comment></course>HAA 283s: Chinese Art: Han through Tang</title>This course will revolutionize how you understand ancient Chinese art.</comment></course>MUSIC 230rs: Topics in Music Theory</title>Be prepared to contribute to the structure and forward motion of the class. That is NOT a criticism: on the contrary, what Prof. Hasty models is a form of academic pursuit in which the dialogue is central. If you put your mind to it, you can shape a conversation from the pieces which are already there. It does take practice, and that practice is built into the course.</comment>This class has made me think about the big questions, not just those concerning music, but those concerning life. This may sound romantic but I do believe that music plays a fundamental role in our experience of life and due to Professor Hasty's open-mindedness and thought-provoking interpretation of music and philosophy, I feel as though I have been given the opportunity to think about the questions that most concern me. This class provides the opportunity for its participants to take risks and think big.</comment></course>EXPOS 20.041: Why Shakespeare?</title>You have to like Shakespeare at least a bit to take this section of Expos, because if not you will suffer through this course</comment>Just get through it</comment>Don't let Shakespeare intimidate you! At first, I was reluctant to take this class because I wasn't a fan of Shakespeare. However, once I started taking the class, I enjoyed Professor Wilson's way of teaching. This class helped me a lot, and now I am more confident about writing!</comment>A lot of people complain about Expos. If you like Shakespeare, take this course! I did not encounter many of the problems I hear about other expos sections. The work load is super manageable, even compared to other expos classes. The professor is great—passionate guy who is willing to meet outside of office hours if you can't make them. I am a science concentrator and I was placed in a non-science expos class. This ended up being a blessing. I recommend taking an English based expos course. Although all professors for Expos know a lot about writing, if your topic is English based then your professor will inherently know more about writing. Definitely the case for this course. It was nice to focus on Shakespeare and literary techniques instead of writing about an experiment. You get more out of this and can apply it if you're in the sciences. Highly recommend!</comment>Interesting subject matter with a preceptor who is knowledgable and genuinely dedicated to improving your writing</comment>Take this course. This was one of my favorite courses of the semester. Professor Wilson is the best and gives every student great and encouraging feedback that motivates you to write. All readings are relevant and enjoyable to read. You get to watch a movie for homework (that's almost too good to be true). Moreover, you really improve your writing and learn so much about different ways to write different papers. This class went beyond my expectations and inspired me to hopefully study Shakespeare more in an academic setting!</comment>Definitely only take this course if you have a good background in Shakespeare. The preceptor is excellent and will provide you with great feedback and ample (perhaps sometimes too much) information on the elements of writing. I wouldn't stress too much about all the components of writing; those will become clearer with time. Be prepared to read each play in less than a week (maybe in a day) in order to have enough time to do analyses. Although the assignments may seem like a lot, they really help in preparing for the papers. Definitely go to office hours/prepare for paper conferences. Wilson is really accessible and supportive; he will point out the flaws in your paper, but guide you through the revision process.</comment></course>GOV 1008: Introduction to Geographical Information Systems</title>Fun to learn an applicable skill and to think about problems in a different way. Sumeeta is outstanding and very reachable/helpful. Labs are a bit of work, though very doable and easy to walk through once you sit down and delve into them.</comment>I would encourage them to be well-informed about what geographic analysis truly is before they take the class, so they know what they are getting themselves into.</comment>If you really want to learn how GIS works and many different applications, it is helpful. However, it is very technical and the weekly labs are quite time consuming and difficult.</comment>If you want to learn GIS, this is the course to do it in. The labs are generally very straightforward, the midterms by contrast are not. You will consolidate your knowledge of ArcGis in a final project which is rewarding because you will feel that you have at least a basic mastery of ArcGis. Be wary though that this class does not require much critical thinking, and is definitely a skill-learning class rather than a class that teaches you to think critically about mapping or GIS.</comment>An introduction to using ArcMap software for GIS. Good for all technical levels. At times tedious, and you end up doing a lot of self learning - looking at tutorials online etc. Sometimes frustrating and more time consuming than you expect, but you walk away with a solid basic skill set and a final project that you can add to your portfolio/thesis.</comment>A perfect introduction course of GIS as a science and for its application.</comment>This class will teach you how to use ArcMap and related programs to produce maps for many data sources. The time commitment is low: 1 hour of lecture per week and a few hours (5-7) to make the maps for weekly labs or to complete the take-home midterm. GIS does appear to be a specialized skill, and it's worth asking yourself how valuable learning it is to you. If you intend to go into public policy or urban planning, it's a good skill to have. If not, you may want to search for another class. 1008 is very good for what it is supposed to do, so take it if you're interested in learning how to use and interpret spatial data.</comment>Gov 1008 is such a fantastic class. Sumeeta is so passionate about GIS and about imparting it to her students! GIS is a useful professional skill and this course will give you a firm grounding in GIS basics. The course structure is fantastic (if you are willing to put in your own time)--one 1-hr lecture per week and ample lab hours for students to work on their lab exercises. If you are willing to work hard and seek help when you need it (and it's certainly offered!), then you will gain so much from this course.</comment>For students who want utilize spatial analysis as part of their research work, this class is essential. In a semester of work you can absorb essential spatial tools that add tremendous value and power.</comment>If you want to learn the fundamentals of GIS and feel comfortable using the program, you should take this class.</comment>Do it! Even if you don't expect to use GIS in the future, this course is insightful in general as well as delivering basic analytical skills.</comment>In the end, this course teaches one thing and one thing only: how to use ArcGIS. It's the equivalent of having a course on how to use MS Word or Excel, which is absurd. I am not sure why this is a class...</comment>Sumeeta is awesome! It's a great class, easy and very useful if you have a research project that uses GIS. You get to work on your own stuff</comment>This course is a great introduction to GIS! I learned all the basic tools that I need to know to put together a simple map and conduct some preliminary analysis.</comment>That they should expect to be self-taught or look to cross-register at other schools.</comment>This is very much a self-directed course. You have to be comfortable with learning on your own, dealing with ambiguity, and feeling like you're just lost for a bit. The professor's lectures are quick, and they are not at all sufficient to master the material. The labs are thorough, but you have to make sure you understand what you're doing, or clarify everything with the professor.</comment></course>HIST 2926: Empires Compared: Proseminar</title>It provokes extremely lively and engaging discussion in class, it provides concrete experience and instruction in pedagogy, and it offers a broad-reaching synthesis of world history from numerous competing perspectives. The readings are great.</comment>This course provides a challenging but fruitful opportunity for students to critically and constructively reflect upon their general approaches to scholarly and pedagogical practice, all while gaining a useful introduction to the study of empires throughout history.</comment>Coming from a specialization outside of western Europe, I felt that this class gave me a good framework and foundation for understanding debates about imperial history going on in that particular area. I really found the assignments worthwhile and for that alone I think the course is worth taking.</comment>A great introduction to a number of important topics in imperial and global history.</comment></course>CELTIC 194: The World of the Celtic Bard</title>This is a great class to learn about a different culture and to see how history and literature are interconnected.</comment>This is an amazing class! All the work and assignments are very fun and Professor McKenna is great. If you're on the fence about this course, definitely take it. You won't regret it! No knowledge about poetry or Celtic history required!</comment>This is a fantastic class! Professor McKenna is wonderful and enthusiastic. The poems and stories we read were fascinating, and the assignments were actually enjoyable. Recommend with enthusiasm!!</comment>Its a fun, engaging course. If you are interested in Bards or poetry then this is worth checking out, just realize it is both poetry and history.</comment>Very light load of work. Read the poems to keep them fresh in your mind</comment></course>MUSIC 153: Jazz Harmony</title>This is an excellent class. Hopefully Dan Henderson is still teaching it.</comment>Jazz 153 was one of the most enjoyable courses I have ever taken. This course expanded my idea of what is possible in music seemingly every week. It was also a wonderful way to start the morning and introduced me to a lot of incredible music. Dr. Henderson and TFs are just wonderful--they are passionate and bring joy to their work every day. I had never composed music before in my life, but I'm walking away with an ability to arrange and write my own jazz. The workload is very reasonable too.</comment>You will have so much fun in this class!!! Prof Henderson is both knowledgeable and funny, a wonderful personality to lead our class. The chance to make recordings of the student compositions for the midterm and final exam is an extraordinary learning opportunity. Whatever level of experience in jazz you have, you can't fail to learn from this class and its wonderful teaching staff.</comment>Dr. Henderson is definitely a performer at heart, but his compositions are also astonishing. Take advantage of office hours and ask questions! His knowledge of jazz is endless, and using his suggestions for your pieces makes them sound professionally written. Have fun in this class but take the assignments seriously, and take note of concepts/phrases you like throughout the semester so it's easier to put your projects together.</comment>This course is completely unlike any course I've taken at Harvard and I enjoyed every minute of it. From Dr. Henderson's very entertaining lectures to the enthusiastic TFs, this course was both laid back and surprisingly informative. What really made this course great, though, was the final project, in which we wrote for an eight person jazz ensemble before a recording session with professional musicians. While the thought of composing a jazz piece for such a large ensemble was daunting, hearing my piece performed by such a talented ensemble was one of the most rewarding experiences I've had in any class at Harvard.</comment>This is an excellent class and literally everyone should take it. It's incredible how much you can learn from such a casual-feeling class--each meeting feels like a conversation. It was really the highlight of every week. The TFs and Professor Henderson were all incredible; I can't recommend it more highly. The projects were also awesome opportunities to apply your knowledge and be blown away by your classmates' pieces.</comment>If you know a little bit of theory and want to explore jazz in the most painless and enjoyable way possible, take this class!!! Dr. Henderson is absolutely the best prof here. Such a nice person and brilliant person</comment>Whether you love jazz or not, you definitely won't regret taking this class. Professor Henderson and the TFs are awesome and passionate; they do a great job explaining the main concepts of the course and linking them to examples so you can really grasp and feel jazz harmony instead of simply having to memorize harmonic/theoretical concepts. The midterm/final projects are enjoyable to work on (how many other classes can you say that for?), and there's no greater feeling than getting to hear your composed music performed live in class by a professional jazz band. Regardless of musical background (though knowing basic music theory is a must), everyone should take this class at some point in their time at Harvard.</comment>Awesome course for people who need an introduction to or need to be strengthen in the jazz harmonic idiom. The staff is absolutely incredible and learning from them and having your songs recorded is so much fun!!</comment>this class owns! dr henderson is the man... super funny, really knowledgable, nice guy. the Tf's are all crazily talented musically and it's a great resource to be able to learn from them. the assignments are awesome - you get to compose your own pieces and they get performed and recorded by a legit jazz band.</comment>This course is absolutely fantastic. It is without a doubt the coolest/best/most rewarding course I have taken at Harvard. You learn SO much about jazz music, harmony, and technique, and have a blast while doing so!</comment>Dr. Henderson is one of the most knowledgeable, experienced, and hilarious people you'll ever have the privilege of meeting. Every lecture is a joy.</comment>Professor Henderson's enthusiasm and love for music is contagious. Definitely take this class. (Also he brings homemade tomatoes that are incredible).</comment>This is a gem of a course at Harvard. The class has such a relaxed feeling, and develops a sense of community, that I think is due to the quality of the professor and the TFs. I looked forward to every lecture, and the opportunity to have two original pieces performed is one of the academic highlights of my time at the college.</comment>TAKE THIS CLASS. It is by far the best course I've taken in my four years at Harvard. Dr. Henderson is engaging, dynamic, and will make you so excited about jazz harmony in general. For each lecture, Dr. Henderson picks a topic of jazz harmony and provides an interactive lecture with examples spanning different genres that demonstrate the specific concept. It is SUCH a blast getting to listen to Stevie Wonder, Disney Soundtracks, and the like for credit! The teaching fellows are also absolutely brilliant and only enhance the experience. And you get to have your midterm/final compositions recorded by professional jazz musicians! Such a phenomenal course, if I could take it five times over I would.</comment>This class will blow your mind with knowledge. Professor Henderson has digested decades and decades of jazz harmony knowledge and research and condensed it into this gem of a course. Not only do you learn about all of the major harmonic concepts in jazz, Dr. Henderson also places each one in its own historical context.</comment>This class is an amazing introduction to the world of jazz composing and to jazz music in general. The projects, though slightly challenging to put together, are extremely rewarding as you walk away with two extremely high-quality recordings of your own music being played by professional musicians (plus watching them work during the recording sessions is also super cool). If you have even the slightest interest in this subject and if Professor Henderson and his TF team are still teaching it, DEFINITELY take this course!</comment>This class is amazing. You learn about harmony and jazz music from an incredibly talented and enthusiastic lecturer and teaching fellows, and get two chances to have your own compositions recorded by professional jazz musicians. Each day we listen to lots of neat music. It's really worth it to put time into the assignments and the compositions and get help from the staff because there's so much to learn from them. Also Daniel Henderson is really funny, and Omar Thomas is generally a boss.</comment>This class is one of those hidden gems in Harvard that you can only dream of finding during your short four years here. But once you do, the search was worth it and your entire semester is lit up from beginning to end. Dr. Henderson=simply dazzling, incredibly knowledgeable, the love of my life. Evan=makes you rethink your idea of a prodigy, his comments are pure gold. Omar=beautiful, intelligent, and actually someone super famous, though you'd never know since he's wonderfully humble. Nick=dashing, witty, and has the bluest eyes that you will get lost in; also he will sit down with you for two hours straight to help you with your arrangement. This was my favorite class at Harvard. The midterms are so exciting. Dr. Henderson brings in wickedly talented instrumentalists to have your piece played. You feel so fortunate by the immense talent you are surrounded by--peers and instructors alike. You learn so much. Just take this class already. You will fall in love.</comment>Dr. Henderson is a gem of a professor.  He is the type of person who makes you want to come to class every day.  His lectures are clear, concise, and will leave you grinning.  Besides, who doesn't like a class where you get to listen to jazz for an hour and a half?</comment></course>HLTHPOL 2000: Core Course in Health Policy</title>Come prepared to class. The more you've prepared the more of a discussion you'll have, which enhances the traditional lecture-based format.</comment>This is a great course in the health policy program and a valuable resource in the process towards understanding issues and strengths in the american health system.</comment></course>AFRAMER 178: Health, Society, and Subjectivity in the American Context</title>The subject matter of this course and the materials provided are all highly interesting. Professor Ralph is incredibly thoughtful and knowledgeable. I would definitely recommend this course for anyone interested in issues of race, health, gender and sexuality.</comment>The class allows for some really interesting discussions and allows you the opportunity to think through a lot of very important issues</comment>This class was excellent. The material and subject matter were not only interesting but extremely relevant. The class discussions were engaging and thought provoking, moving far beyond the surface or traditional rhetoric. I actually felt like all of the work and assignments had a purpose and made me engage with the material in a productive way.</comment>This is a great course you being to think critically about topics and issues that you would've never examined in the same eye before taking the class. Professor Ralph and Nick are amazing.</comment>This course was an excellent review of major issues in medical anthropology, working through an extensive array of personal narratives of suffering dealing with the stigma & experience of race, gender, socioeconomic class, disability, structural violence, immigration, and illness. Professsor Ralph is encouraging and intelligent and creates a supportive & inclusive environment: each student is expected to give a demonstration on a set of readings throughout the course and my class was filled with the most badass socially conscious ladies around (and one gentleman.) I would highly recommend this class. You'll learn a bunch of awful things about the United States and the world in general, but you won't leave without some hope for the future. Also, Professor Ralph is really cool.</comment>This course was really, really great! It's one of those courses that everyone at Harvard should take before they graduate. The work load wasn't bad (a couple of papers, and weekly reflections), but it was one of the most thought provoking and worthwhile classes I have taken here at Harvard. I'm a pre-med, and though we talk about health, it's very much from a perspective of the people that are often marginalized in the health care system due to structural barriers both within and outside this system. Such a great class - take it!</comment>I loved this class. Professor Ralph really goes out of his way to engage students. The workload is manageable-- you won't dread doing the work for this class and every weekly reading is less than 50 pages and is highly relevant.</comment>I'm extremely glad you're taking this class; it was life changing.</comment>This class is easy if you put the time in and participate in every lecture and section.</comment>It's a great class and will help you think critically about race, health,suffering, subjectivity and the production of knowledge.</comment>This class is great!</comment>It really gets you to think about narratives of pain and suffering in ways that are so necessary</comment></course>CHNSE 120a: Intermediate Modern Chinese</title>Chinese 120a is a phenomenal class. It is very fast paced but it really expands your Chinese vocabulary and enables you to communicate in a much more effective and authentic manner. It is definitely a lot of work, but I think it is important to remember that the teachers are there to help you. They want you to do well in the class, so if you have any issues make sure to tell them. Go to the one-on-one sessions to improve your speaking and pronunciation. It helps tremendously when preparing for oral exams.</comment>While intimidating, the Chinese language is an equally rewarding subject to consider studying.</comment>Chinese 120a is a very rigorous course. It is well taught, and is a course that requires a lot of INPUT. Take this class if you are passionate about the language and want to take advantage of a great department. The department is structured such that you will receive significant 1-on-1 time with professors.</comment>It's amazing and everyone should take it!</comment>be prepared to put in a lot of work!</comment>Quizzes are extremely difficult, expect to spend lots of time in preperation</comment>The Chinese program at Harvard has no equal.</comment>This class builds well off of what we learned in Ba and Bb. While there could be more focus on speaking over writing, Chinese 120a has helped me understand the language and culture better. If you want to continue to study Chinese, this class is both an excellent choice and your only choice.</comment>This class is fantastic--Chinese is definitely a difficult language, but if you're willing to put in the work it's fascinating and rewarding.</comment>Great course to take if you want to continue to improve your skill in the language.</comment>I really love learning Chinese at Harvard and I think the 120a course is great. My reservations are actually that it's too easy, but which I mean that I see a lot of areas in which other language courses push us that Chinese doesn't. For instance, I also took second year Spanish and feel that we were given far more writing tasks in Spanish than in Chinese. I would really appreciate the opportunity to improve upon my writing ability instead of just doing homework sheets with sentences that are really simple and come straight from the text book.</comment>If any part of you wants to learn Chinese, do it here! Great class, difficult, but you will see results.</comment>This course is excellent for teaching you massive amounts of Chinese in a relatively short period of time. You should take this course if you have an interest in improve your language skills beyond the basic level. Lessons cover practical topics, like travel, food, and studying, which gears you well for any travel abroad you may wish to take in the future. Do the preparation before class by reading the dialogues and learning the vocabulary because you will be more likely to retain the lessons for the assessments throughout the semester.</comment>It's my favorite class at Harvard. Definitely take it, the teachers are wonderful.</comment>Really felt like I solidified my basic Chinese. Textbook and materials are well written, and class is well structured. Harder material than Ba/Bb but doesn't seem harder because it is similarly structured. Would definitely recommend</comment>More no-nonsense than Chinese Ba or Bb, but it's still a great class and a ton of fun.</comment>Take if you only have 1 year of experience with chinese.  Do not take if you have more than that.</comment>This course requires a lot of hard work and daily practice, but the language improvement is noticeable.</comment>Out of all the classes I took this semester, I found Chinese to be the best taught, and as a result my Chinese improved a tremendous amount, and that I learned more in this class than I did in any others.</comment>Make sure to have a solid background on reading, writing. and grammar as it will be expected of you in the course. You will not be able to speak English in class unless it is completely necessary, so be prepared to practice speaking a lot.</comment>Excellent course, make sure to review and practice with the grammar patterns and vocab frequently</comment>Similar to Chinese Bb in how the course is run. Very stringent grading, with policies for point deduction extremely vague. However, the amount you'll learn over the course of the semester is huge; I cannot recommend this course highly enough. My only qualms are that there are not greater measures taken in order to ensure vocabulary words and grammar structures are thoroughly learned and remembered for the entire semester.</comment>The teachers are perfect, you'll learn a ton without feeling too overwhelmed</comment>If you're okay with taking a challenge, take this course. It's totally cool and absolutely worth it.</comment>This class, like all Chinese language classes, requires a lot of work. There are two dictations per week of about 25 characters, a homework assignment (which'll take between half an hour and an hour), a recitation, and oftentimes also a quiz or essay. Don't be fooled by this only being a second-year language course: I came into it as a freshman, having taken up to 5th year Chinese in high school (I skipped a year in the language because I stayed in China for a summer with an immersion program), and it was definitely the right place for me and still a challenge at times. 

That said, this is a FANTASTIC Chinese course. I think it would be very difficult to find one of its caliber anywhere else. The teachers are extremely kind and organized, and you get a ton of individual attention. If you're looking to hone your Chinese skills, this department is extremely well-qualified to help.</comment></course>LITER 147: "Why the Jews?": The Modern Jewish Experience in Literature</title>I was glad I did all the readings for this class but often felt that class discussions did not dig in as much as I would have liked.</comment>Not just a class for Jews! The books are really good and Professor Horn is great.</comment>This is a really neat class to take, and it explores Judaism from a lot of different, often unconventional perspectives. Even someone who grew up surrounded by Jewish culture and/or practice should take this. Awesome class.</comment>The course was quite challenging for someone without an English or Literature background. While I truly enjoyed the material, I found the writing assignments difficult. Professor Horn was accessible to provide significant feedback on drafts, but the questions and analysis were harder than what I was expecting. I really walked away from the course with an understanding of Jewish literature and the context in which it was written, but aside from the readings I spent a significant amount of time writing each paper and trying to understand the various themes being discussed.</comment>before taking this course make sure have an understanding of Jewish historical events</comment>This was an excellent class! I thoroughly enjoyed the readings and discussions. Prof. Horn was a phenomenal instructor, and it was a real treat to have a seminar dynamic.</comment></course>SPANSH Aa: Beginning Spanish I</title>Excellent class! Not hard at all, though there is some level of work to be involved (though this is the case with any class here). You won't regret taking this class :)</comment>It's a super fun class to have in your schedule! You know exactly what to expect in terms of assignments, grading, and quizzes. The time commitment is very minimal compared to other pset classes and as long as you are putting in your hour of spanish everyday after class you will be good to go!</comment>I would tell future students to pay attention in class when new lessons are being taught because homework and tests are based off of these lessons.</comment>Great all-around language class. Relatively painless. Be prepared to be treated like you're in high school again, but it's an effective structure for learning Spanish. Some of the small assignments seem pointless. But you will leave this class with a firm grasp on basic Spanish.</comment>It's the perfect class for beginners in Spanish.</comment>Taking Spanish AA was probably one of the best decision I made in my freshman fall. I highly recommend it. The class was a light in my day.</comment>Overall this course did not spark my interest and it failed to make me excited each day. It does serve the purpose of learning Spanish, but if you are truly a beginner it is easy to fall behind.</comment>This is a very good course for building basic understanding of Spanish. The work you put in with all the homeworks and quizzes is really worth it in the end and helps you get a good grasp of basic spanish.</comment>Do your homework every night.</comment>This was one of my favorite classes at Harvard! Extremely well taught and very well organized to facilitate language learning!</comment>Spanish Aa is a great introduction to Spanish. No previous Spanish experience is necessary to succeed in this course. I would certainly recommend this course to someone who has little to no experience in Spanish and has an interest in learning the language.</comment>This course is great and very useful.</comment>Its a great intro class that teaches you so much in so little time!</comment>It's extremely tedious and unexciting, but ultimately helpful as a beginning spanish course.</comment>You learn a surprising amount of Spanish in one semester! It is a great introduction to the basic vocabulary, grammar, verbs, and even Spanish speaking countries!</comment>Good class, very consistent workload, you learn quite a bit!</comment>Great class, do all the homework and review on weekends.</comment>Its a fine class to take, but theres a pretty constant workload that cant be avoided... maybe consider a different language if you dont know any spanish going in</comment>Natalie is the best and if you are unsure about Spanish take this</comment>Without any prior experience in Spanish, this class will be a fair amount of work and studying outside of class. But as long as you are willing to participate and be active in class, it will be a great class.</comment>It's a great course. It's taught well and I learned a lot.</comment>It's great and try to get Jose as your teacher!</comment>You don't have to know anything but it really helps because this class moves quickly</comment>The class is demanding yet if you invest in the material, you will finish much more versed and informed of Spanish.</comment>It is a good class especially when you have a small one. It can be fun at times and boring at times. Overall, if you study and put some effort into it, you will do well.</comment>Some instructors are less willing to explain and help with questions students might have regarding grammar, vocab, etc</comment>Take this class! It's a lot of fun and well worth the 4 days a week</comment>You do not need any background knowledge of the language.</comment>Take this class! If you can get Prof. Gonzalez, do it. He is so gentle, funny, caring about his students. One of my favorite classes.</comment>It moves very quickly.</comment>Straightforward class covering basic/foundation spanish material</comment>Spanish AA is fun and easy, especially if you have taken Spanish in the past</comment>The course is not difficult but you have to work for your grade.</comment>Be prepared for lots of work, and see if you have any prior experience in Spanish.</comment>Very fair course.</comment>Do every online assignment and follow the syllabus readings.</comment>If you want to learn another language, take an intro course. Spanish is easily handled and learned in a semester or two!</comment>This class is a challenging but doable introduction to Spanish for those with no prior experience.</comment>Paying attention in class makes the course really easy.</comment>This class is a great intro to Spanish. Even if you've had a little bit of Spanish, still take this class. You will learn a lot more than in other language classes in high school, as it is taught really well. All the TFs are really helpful. The assignments can be tedious but you will learn a lot.</comment>fun course</comment>Jose is a great teacher and you really learn a lot.</comment>It was very difficult at first, but you'll eventually catch on.</comment>interesting and makes learning a new language fun</comment>Try to take outside Spanish beginner course before taking this.</comment>Its a nice introduction into a language however some classes move fairly quickly because generally students taking this class have taken it before in high school</comment>The class moves quickly, so be aware of that.</comment>easy for language credit</comment>If you're not confident in your spanish speaking abilities, definitely take this course and not AB.</comment>It is a great introduction to Spanish and you will be able to have a number of conversations after completing the course.</comment>This provides a great foundation to move ahead con español.</comment>If you haven't taken spanish before, this course will be difficult. If you want to do well you'll have to keep up with the readings</comment>If you want to learn Spanish and you don't have a background, this is a great place to start. The TAs/TFs are really helpful and enthusiastic, and make the class a lot of fun. I did not have a great experience learning a foreign language in high school, but this reversed my previous notions.</comment>If you want to learn Spanish and/or need to fulfill your language requirement, this is the class to take.  It's not too difficult, but you will find that you actually learn a lot by the end of the semester.</comment>I think this class was great and not too challenging. Mostly, I liked learning the language.</comment>A great way to learn spanish. At first I didn't have confidence and was afraid to participate, but once I did I learned quickly and had fun. It's better if you know like a year or two of spanish. The kids that came in without it definitely struggled, although once they put in more work it ended up okay.</comment>Not very hard, fun if you like speaking.</comment>This course is a really good way to introduce yourself to Spanish. It is engaging and is very similar to a high school course (simple exercises for homework, occasional quizzes and short compositions).</comment>This class is fantastic.</comment>It's a beginning language: time-consuming, sometimes frustrating, but worthwhile if you put the time into it.</comment>The instructor will only speak spanish or may not be fluent in english. Meeting everyday is pretty taxing but it isn't too much homework. But there's a lot of independent learning involved such as reading the textbook and learning most of the concepts by yourself. How much your spanish improves really depends how much effort you put in the course.</comment>Take the practice tests online.</comment>It is a standard intro to Spanish. The class moves quickly, but not so much so that one cannot keep up with the material. The work load is relatively light and the unit quizzes aren't too difficult. Overall, an enjoyable and informative class.</comment>I would tell future students that this class is very rewarding and is well worth the work.</comment>Don't let vocabulary be your downfall.</comment>Its hard but you get used to it eventually.</comment>If you are taking to just fulfill the requirement, take ibo or another exotic language with like 5 students. They only meet once a week and barely do any work. I took spanish because i figured that it was more practical, but its not worth meeting four days a week and doing hours of online activities.</comment>Anyone is able to do this class without knowing Spanish beforehand.</comment>It is a lot of work but that is because it is a lot of work to learn a new language. If you are prepared to do a bit of work everyday you learn a lot.</comment>This class was very fun and a great way to meet friends because we talk so much in class.</comment>Good way to learn another language.</comment>I learned more spanish than I ever thought I was capable, especially in a course instructed almost entirely in spanish.</comment>Study hard and try to understand the material fully so that you can learn Spanish, rather than simply learning how to pass an exam.  Araceli put a strong emphasis on understanding spanish, not just being able to translate for a test.</comment>great teachers</comment>This is a very quick paced language class. It also is a lot of work so don't take it unless you're serious about taking Spanish.</comment>This course offers a lot of support for people just starting Spanish.</comment>Low workload language class. Put 30 mins of work in after every class to do the activities, spend 1-2 hr do writing assignments and studying for quizzes. Not bad.</comment>I was and am still really excited to learn Spanish, but after having taken the class with no prior experience, I want to make clear that it is not very easy. Be prepared from the beginning if you plan on taking this class because once you fall behind, it is hard to catch back up.</comment></course>APCOMP 298r: Interdisciplinary Seminar in Computational Science & Engineering</title>If you need a class to balance out your work load. This is it.</comment>It is a necessary course if your other courses are rigorous and demanding.</comment>A great course to balance out an unwieldy or interview-ridden semester, but be warned: not really fulfilling unless you have the applied math background to understand the readings and guest lectures.</comment>Taking this course only as a buffer to prevent you overloading in one semester.</comment>This is a discussion-based course providing a high level view of a broad range of topics in computational science. Doing the background reading and attending the pre-seminar discussion are really helpful in getting the most out of the seminar presentation itself. This is a good course to balance out a heavy workload, but hopefully you will find the material engaging as well.</comment>This class is great for students whose schedules are otherwise full of heavily technical coursework. The more "communicative" nature of 298r makes for nice schedule balance.</comment></course>HIST 60h: Good Works: Charity and Philanthropy before the Modern Era</title>A great class! Meredith is a wonderful and enthusiastic instructor, the readings are really eye-opening, and cover a subject that is so important to think about but not really covered at Harvard. The research project is a good opportunity to pick something you're interested in and work on it for the whole semester--you are given pretty much free reign over what you want to write about so that's nice.</comment></course>CHEM 100r: Experimental Chemistry and Chemical Biology</title>relatively low-commitment class where you learn a ton. all the teaching staffs are real nice and chemdraw is awesome.</comment>Great class! The staff are super helpful and make lab time enjoyable. Making powerpoint presentations every week for lab meeting is kind of time consuming, and the final written paper also takes a lot of time, but it's totally worth it. Shoutout to lab manager Zack for being awesome!</comment>Chem 100r is an amazing opportunity to work with incredibly accomplished faculty on innovative chemistry research. Through the course of the semester, you become immersed in your project and make a contribution to chemistry. One of the best chemistry courses I have taken at Harvard. I recommend it with the highest enthusiasm!</comment>A great class! A lot of time in lab but definitely worth the experience!</comment>Absolutely amazing advanced chem lab! Recommend with extreme enthusiasm!</comment>One of the best classes I've taken at Harvard. I'm definitely not a "research" kind of person at all and really loved this class. It puts together a lot of the stuff that has no context in orgo an the project based learning approach is awesome. Also the TF's for this course of incredible and extremely knowledgeable.  

That being said, this course is a HUGE time commitment - don't take this with too many time intensive courses because it will make for a really rough semester. Definitely a class to look forward to though! 10/10 would recommend!</comment>If you are wondering which lab course to take as a chem concentrator, I would definitely choose this one. The support and individual attention this course offers are, in my experience, unparalleled at Harvard. Low stress yet extremely packed with information, this course really allows you to learn through doing. Results are not as stressed as process, and this makes for an even more fun and educational semester.</comment>This was probably my favorite class I've taken at Harvard. Even though it's a big time commitment, I was always really excited to go to lab so it wasn't an issue at all. In general, it was really fun, and you learn so much. Also, the teaching staff is incredible! Highly, highly recommended.</comment>Great course. Enables you to get really great lab experience in a creative, relaxed setting. The teaching staff is incredibly helpful and friendly, which makes every part of the class enjoyable and worthwhile.</comment>One of the best courses I've taken so far at Harvard. If you're looking for a great introduction to chemistry research that finds a beautiful middle ground between giving you a good amount of freedom and the right amount of guidance, this is it! Course staff are extremely helpful, obviously care a great deal about the course and its students, and are there to answer any questions you might have. I can point to this class as one of the single classes that made me most excited about science and research at Harvard.</comment></course>EXPOS 20.263: Writing the Environment</title>If you're interested in environmental writing, this is a good class for you. Or if you're afraid writing about a topic you really like will cause you to hate the subject, then this is a good backup since the novels read in class can be useful in the future.</comment>Martin was an excellent Preceptor! I learned so much from him, and he is very understanding of the demands of other classes while still having high expectations for his own.</comment>If how man interacts with the environment is very interesting to you, this could be a good course for you. That being said, there is a decent amount of work and sometimes it feels a bit overwhelming, although I am not sure if that is standard for expos or specific to this class. Personally, I would only recommend this class if you are pretty confident you are going to be interested in the material.</comment>The instructor is amazing and accessible.</comment>Make an effort for your drafts so that you can get good feedback on it at the conferences.</comment>The course preceptor, Martin Greenup is quite ineffective and has no control over the class. The course has not contributed to my writing skills in any way. The activities done during class time were very unproductive and did not tie in with the course material. There was an excessive amount of reading and requirements expected to be completed in a very short period of time. The feedback I got for the drafts of my essay were utterly vague and fruitless, which left me at a loss during the revision process.</comment>This class is challenging but very rewarding as you will get better as a writer if you put in the work.</comment>You may not be a huge fan of the environment and the sensationalism that surrounds it, even if you agree that the environmental movement has merit, but this class is still definitely a great option. Martin is very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about what he teaches, and he always has new ideas on the table that you can make use of in your drafts and essays. Don't be daunted by the first unit on Walden, it's by far the most difficult, time consuming, and the slowest. Everything'll get much better afterward.</comment></course>SOC-STD 98oc: Religion and Secularism in a Global World</title>This class is great if you have an interest in religion/secularism and Professor Bernstein was extremely knowledgeable on the topic.</comment>If you are a junior in social studies who really enjoys exploring issues of religion and secularism, then take this course!</comment></course>EXPOS 20.098: HIV/AIDS in Culture</title>Joaquin is a very good instructor and writing coach. He has done a lot in this semester to help me become a better writer and to think about many things differently. The only thing that causes trouble at times is how quickly he responds to emails. At times you may have important questions you need answered about assignments that may take him a while to get back on.</comment>More so than I anticipated, I found this course very engaging, interesting, and enjoyable. Joaquin is a compassionate instructor who makes it easy to comfortably approach a sensitive topic. Having only been tangentially interested in the culture surrounding HIV/AIDS before, I now intend to further explore the topic on my own. In terms of the writing assignments, Joaquin offers very fair, constructive criticism.</comment>So incredibly interesting. This class evokes passion within the people that take it.</comment>Need to be interested in the course material to enroll. Otherwise it will be boring.</comment>as expos courses go, this is a pretty good one. i felt like i didn't hate it like some of my peers hated their expos courses</comment>I strongly reccomend that you take this class. It was the best class I took all semester. The information about writing and the more general information that we learned about HIV/AIDS was very valuable. Joaquin is an amazing instructor and always kept section very interesting. He was very fair in his grading and gave great feedback.</comment>Take this class! Joaquin's great, the reading's are all manageable and interesting, and the class discussion is enjoyable. Definitely one of the best expos classes.</comment>I would highly recommend this course for the Expos 20 requirement.  Most people hate expos, yet this class is so enjoyable.  Joaquin has such a broad range of knowledge, and is so helpful in terms of writing that I got so much out of this course, in terms of writing and AIDS education.  Whether you're into science or not, this class is a great look into the culture of the country during the AIDS crisis, so it gives you a completely different perspective.  Joaquin is the best, and you should definitely take this class!!!</comment>Doesn't feel like the stereotypical Expos class; very interesting; great preceptor</comment>Expos is just one of those things you have to get through, and having an amazing teacher like Joaquin is the only thing that really helps make it better.  The topic is great and interesting but there's not a ton of relation between the topic and the course requirements, but Joaquin's feedback is the most important part anyway.</comment>Great expos class!!! Joaquin is such an amazing teacher and person in general! Definitely take this expos class if you're at all interested in the portrayal of HIV in culture or even in disease in general because it definitely gives you a different perspective on HIV. Honestly, expos is a pain that every freshman is going to have to take, but I'm so happy I chose this one!! Definitely recommend!!</comment></course>GOV 3001: Approaches to the Study of Politics</title>The course is a great opportunity to get to know the work of a range of scholars in the department and to get an introduction to some of the key debates in the field, but the overall of structure of the course could be a bit more focused.</comment>This course is an excellent way to get exposed to the variety within political science. It is also a great time to start developing nascent research ideas and get feedback from your peers and Dan.</comment>this is a requirement but it's not too stressful. you really get out of it what you put in, so its a great introduction to graduate school and the way you should see your courses here. don't stress out too much about this course. professor carpenter is great and will make class discussions interesting. if you don't read the papers, at least skim them or the abstracts so that you can facilitate discussion.</comment>You get as much out of this class as you put in (at least in its current format).</comment></course>MODMIDEAST 158a: Modern Arabic Literature Seminar: The Racialized Other in Arabian Peninsula Literature and Culture</title>Amazing class!</comment></course>SCI-PHYUNV 20: What is Life? From Quarks to Consciousness</title>This is a good easy way to fulfill either SLS or SPU. I cam from a Physics background so I already knew a lot of the things covered, but I still learned a lot on how about biology and how the physics concepts apply to the biological ones. I would recommend the course. It is a lot of fun without too much work.</comment>Andrew Berry and Logan are both incredible. Super smart, funny, and passionate. However, the course material is not super well organized, and sometimes lecture was kind of boring.</comment>I have mixed feelings about this class. It is taught by incredible teachers who clearly care about their material (Logan and Andrew are phenomenal) and also care that you understand it and are willing to work with you to do so. It covers fascinating subject material that unites diverse scientific material together, and the final creative project is so fun and is the type of project you don't find often enough at Harvard.  However, by being so ambitious, the class has some structural problems. The first is that - because it covers both SPU and SLS - the class fills with physicists who want SLS and biologists/chemists who want SPU. If you're not a science person, this makes the class more difficult because at times the lectures are not targeted at you and because basic concepts are moved through quickly. Because of the curve on exams, you will have to work hard to stay ahead, and despite working hard I somehow doubt that my final grades in this class will reflect the relative effort I put in compared to my peers. Furthermore, there is no textbook that distills lectures, so if you don't have this background it becomes harder to figure things out and do the weekly problem sets. Similarly, the lecture slides are not very helpful (e.g. many diagrams, not many take aways), so you will need to stay on top of your game to take diligent notes throughout. I hope that in future iterations of this course the lectures are redone so that they assume less background knowledge and that course reading are made more useful.  Conclusion: take this class if you want a unique gen-ed that will teach you cool things about how different scientific disciplines have approached the fundamental questions of what life is, and if you're tired of nonsense classes with professors who don't care about what they're teaching. However, if you don't have a science background (ideally in 2 of the 3: chemistry, physics, biology), be prepared to be frustrated at times.</comment>This class was great! Both professors are very engaging and very accessible. If you've ever wanted to explore major scientific discoveries in the last century, this is the class for you; you'll most likely learn about them.</comment>A great survey of science as it relates to living organisms.</comment>This class is fun and informative, it is the quintessential gen ed. Want to learn about the universe from a quirky physicist and a satirically comic British man, take this class. Small class size, awesome professors, and the best final creative project ever!!!</comment>Professors Berry and McCarty are engaging, dynamic, and really great at explaining material. It was fun to learn about the concept of "life" through bio, chem, and physics and get cursory overviews of topics in each field. The problem sets are worthwhile without being too difficult, the workload in general is quite light, and the final project (and seeing everyone else's projects too!) was one of my favorite assignments of the semester.</comment>Good way to do SPU, not too much work, pretty interesting</comment>This class is a true gem at Harvard. It has two of the most engaging professors who switch on and off in giving lectures, which means there is never a dull moment. Everything we learn relates to life in some way but can be as varied as binary code or quantum mechanics. The weekly psets are not too difficult but still feel like "real science". I wish all gen eds could be as intellectually challenging and rewarding as SPU 20.</comment>If you would like a comprehensive look at the world of science with fabulous instructors, this course is for you. That being said, many STEM concentrators take this course and have a clear advantage in understanding the material and doing well on exams.</comment>This class was awesome! It tries to tell a story of how life is as it is today, bringing in the Big Bang and integrating chemistry into Biology and discussing evolution and genetics. It's a lot, and sometimes a little scattered, but all super interesting things to think about, made very accessible and fun, and Professors McCarty and Berry are two individuals it simply a pleasure to learn from due to their passion for their subjects, their energy, and their dedication to teaching. I really enjoyed coming to lecture each day, and it doesn't have a separate lab or section, which is great for an SPU. The creative final project is a lot of fun, the midterms and problem sets are very fair. An excellent class, exactly what a Gen Ed should be.</comment>Easy as hell.</comment>This course had many strengths, mostly stemming from the two professors.  Having two professors teach two different topics but join them together was a great way to synthesize a lot of chemistry and physics that I had some previous experience in with some new biology information.  The course went through the origin of life from the standpoint of not only biology, but also quantum mechanics and chemistry, which was very cool.  The problem sets tested things that were directly discussed in lecture, and there were no sections or additional lab times, which made the class very easy to keep track of and less stressful.  The final project was a great way to be creative and try something new, while recalling much of what was learned throughout the semester (and the party where we presented our final projects was a blast, and an awesome way to see other people's talents and get a reminder of all that we learned).  The two in-class midterms were fair and we were allowed 1 cheat sheet for each, which was a nice gesture.  There were many in-class demonstrations, videos, etc. that were helpful in keeping students interested and enthusiastic, making the class more informative and fun.  The fact that there were only 20+ students in a small classroom setting and 1 professor watching the other lecture with the students meant there was lots of room for asking questions mid-lecture and making it more of a class discussion, with both professors chiming in.  As somebody who loves science this class was awesome, but it is even better for people with little science background who want to fulfill an SPU or SLS Gen Ed where the class is fun, they can learn a lot, and it is not too tough (but also no joke).</comment>In addition to being generally easy and laid-back, this course was incredibly interesting, both for its content and for its format. It was taught with two lecturers (Andrew Berry and Logan McCarty), in an intimate and highly participatory classroom setting, with in-class activities and smooth (sometimes optional) readings. The end-of-the-year activities were particularly fun, creative, and interesting. It's a very good model for a Gen Ed of its kind. Also, the course's synthesis of chemistry, physics, biology, and philosophy made for a very engaging experience! That said, it sometimes tended to be disorganized, with some lectures being taught later when they would be more appropriate earlier, lots of jargon thrown around without clear definitions, and assignments that varied in difficulty. Other than that, I highly recommend this class if you want to fulfill either the physical or life science requirement.</comment></course>MATH 141: Introduction to Mathematical Logic</title>Take this class if you'd like a introduction into the foundations of mathematics. It doesn't really get into the nitty gritty of things, but it's a good introduction.</comment>Really great class! You learn a lot about the foundations upon which math is built, cool stuff like Godel's Incompleteness Theorem (two versions!), and it's all quite related to CS also (although the relationships aren't explicitly mentioned in this course, take something like CS 121/124/125 and you'll see the interconnections. It also doesn't require much time, the psets are 2 or 3 hours a week and the exams are fairly easy. So, what's there to lose? Take it!</comment></course>HIST-LIT 90l: Stories of Slavery and Freedom</title>If you're interested in this material and are willing to have your opinions of the world changed, this class will be one of the best you take at Harvard. Tim is unbelievable, the readings are long but beautiful, and the assignments will challenge the way you understand history and literature. All around one of my two or three favorite classes here.</comment>It was an amazing course! Stories of Slavery and Freedom truly exceeds any expectations I had about colonial literature. Not only do you leave the semester with a larger understanding of the colonial lit- af-american literary cannon, but you leave a more confident speaker, a more conscientious analytic and a more informed activists.</comment>This is, without question, the most life-changing class I have taken at Harvard. If you have the opportunity, take the class. It will challenge and change you. I have studied many works on this syllabus multiple times, but these texts still came to life and surprised me every class</comment>This class is amazing! Class discussions are engaging and thought-provoking. Professor McCarthy is also one of the best professors I've had at Harvard and cares so much about his students.</comment>I could not recommend this course enough. Hands down best course I have taken in my four years at Harvard. It will absolutely change your life. The material is so important and you will want to complete all the reading and prepare thoroughly for each week's seminar. I learned so much in this course and wish it could continue into the spring. You will not regret for a second taking this course.</comment>Easily one of the best courses I've ever taken at Harvard.  For the first time, I really felt as though I understood the importance of studying history to better understand today.  Tim is an incredible professor, and, don't get me wrong, he assigns quite a lot of reading, but I never once thought it wasn't worth it.  If you have the opportunity to take this course: TAKE IT.  You will not be sorry you did.</comment>This course truly challenged my perceptions of slavery and race. Take it or another class with Professor McCarthy if you get the chance. Thoroughly reading sources really isn't necessary to class participation but they're good readings and you'll get a lot out of them - essentially read them because you should and because you'll want to, not because you'll have to.</comment>Oh man, how do I list the strengths. Every component of it was extraordinary. The sections were incredible and the way TPM facilitated, stepped back, allowed us to really feel and connect with the texts - everything was phenomenal.</comment>Best class I've taken at Harvard. The epitome of Hist and Lit and an incredible survey of American slavery. Prof. McCarthy and the design of the course are excellent</comment>This course is absolutely incredible, Tim is the best professor I've ever had and really is incredible, believe the hype!</comment></course>PSY 1504: Social Cognition: Making Sense of our Social World</title>Katherine is a great professor and mentor. She is also very accessible outside the classroom. The class size is small, which allows a lot of personal interactions between prof. and students as well as among students. We really get to know each other through the class, the readings and the activities. The readings are very interesting and we only read one or two papers/book chapters a week, so not that much (mostly to prepare for class discussions.)</comment>I would highly recommend this course for any one who desires to learn about the latest research in social psychology and understand social psychology concepts in depth to better understand how and why people act the way they do. Dr. Powers is an excellent and engaging teacher who teaches about many social psychology concepts in various interesting and interactive ways and provides excellent feedback for one to improve their writing.</comment>Professor Powers really knows her stuff and cares about the class. She doesn't seem to have lost her excitement for teaching like some professors. She has really set the class up well, and it's different in many ways than other courses at Harvard. However, it is a basic social psych course, so be prepared for some repetition if you've been in psych for awhile. Also, this could either have been just our specific class or the type of people Professor Powers draws, but some people in the class were really frustrating, dominating discussions and detouring the conversation. I only think this is relevant because sometimes this people were basically allowed to roam free, taking over the class. This was frustrating. Also, the work load is great--the readings are actually light enough that you can dig into each one (and actually want to)--however, Professor Powers is not a super-easy grader.</comment>Pros:  1. The class is very well-structured. You will never feel lost. 2. The assignments are well-communicated, and the guidelines are clear. 3. There are 2 debates. If you like debating psychological issues, you might enjoy this.  4. You get helpful feedback from the professor, in a timely manner. 5. The class is small, so you get to know your classmates, and the teacher well. (Which can be GREAT if you like them and if they are actively participating, or might be not be great if they do not care as much).  Cons:  1. If you have taken Social Psychology, you may find this class to be repetitive.  2. Some of my friends in the class and I found the teacher to be inflexible. If you are a senior and expect to miss class even once, there are no excused absences and it will affect your grade. If you are planning to leave one day early for Thanksgiving, you will be penalized. In fact, class presentations (7% of the grade) were delivered the day before Thanksgiving. The teacher refused to allow absence, to share the presentations with the students who missed the class or to be flexible in any way. This caused a lot of stress to me.   This was not one of my favorite Psychology courses. Most Psych courses I have taken so far were more fun and engaging.</comment>This is a great class. Professor Powers does a great job teaching while also making the class fun at the same time. The class discussions are fun and Professor Powers is awesome and helps make the class enjoyable.</comment></course>RUSS B: Intermediate Russian</title>It's a bit of a grind at times but it really helps solidify grammar</comment>do the reading.</comment>Take the class for the instructors. Veronika Aleksandrovna is new to the department, but she is just as good or better than the rest of the Russian preceptors, who have awesome reputations. Daniel is very good as well. I think it's great to have a native English speaker teach Russian B, since it is so grammar heavy.</comment>A really good Russian class. I found it to be a lot of fun and I feel that my language skills have really improved as a result of this class. It can be a lot of work, but make sure you put in the time to learn the language outside of the class, or you will begin to fall behind. Both instructors are super available and super awesome, always willing to help you with your Russian. This course really helped my confidence and speaking ability, and we also learned a decent amount about culture.</comment>Although the first semester is grammar-heavy, this is a phenomenal course. Building on and refining what you learned in Russian A is challenging, but extremely satisfying.</comment></course>ANTHRO 2250a: Proseminar in Archaeology</title>prepare more time than you think you need for readings</comment></course>HUMAN 10a: The Humanities Colloquium: Essential Works 1</title>Provides the communicative space to read and talk about the most important texts in the Western tradition. This course should be mandatory. Reading these books makes you a better person.</comment>It's tough but it is also fun. It will teach you how to write coherent essays. It is also one of the few opportunities you will have as a freshman to be in a small section with a professor (and the Hum10a Professors are all leaders in their fields).</comment>Know it's a lot of reading, but the lectures and sections are SO GOOD</comment>Take this course, especially if you haven't read these books (they are fantastic), but if only to have the chance to get to know some amazing scholars.</comment>This course is an invaluable opportunity to interact with some of Harvard's most distinguished humanities professors, in particular, Professor Menand and Professor Greenblatt, who spearhead the class. Be prepared to read quite a bit, and to be challenged by the material. Elizabeth Phillips, at least, is a wonderful TF who is easy to reach and provides effective feedback on writing. It's important to go into section with the knowledge that the texts you're studying are complicated, and can hardly be absorbed in the week you're given to read them. As such, section is a time to explore your perhaps vague ideas and to get as good an understanding as you can in such short time. Go to as many class excursions as possible!</comment>Lectures are amazing, as is the access in section to each of the professors.  Essays are hard, as well as the huge task of keeping up with the reading every week.</comment>The more time you can spend reading these works and thinking on them, the better. I imagine this is the kind of class it would be nice to take with a friend, with whom one could continue to talk about the ideas outside a limited section time. Lectures are wonderful, and section is helpful for providing a bit more of a foothold, but I'm not leaving with a feeling of noteworthy familiarity with any of the works. The course really begins to come together in the last weeks, and the ultimate lecture, in which professors answered student questions, was moving, and a powerful reminder of why I had taken the course and chosen to study humanities.</comment>This class is A LOT of reading. Really too much reading. And it really doesn't make sense to take a Great Books class like this if you are not going to do the reading. You really can't take this class and get a lot of out of it and do the reading if you are taking other time-intensive classes. Also, it can be a bit frustrating since you read a lot, and only have 1 section to discuss a book like the Odyssey. It's a great intro the humanities and the western canon, but unless you are sure you are really interested in spending lots of time reading interesting but challenging works.</comment>The Professors are great!</comment>Be aware that it's a lot of reading and the grading is not fair.</comment>Be aware that the texts will not be studied in depth, but that the course is more about the idea of studying humanities-- quite literally an intro course. Through this course you may find out whether or not you truly wish to be involved in the humanities at Harvard pretty early on.</comment>It's tough. But it's definitely worthwhile.</comment>This class is epic in every sense of the word. You will not regret taking it.</comment>Your experience will be defined by your section leader. For me, this worked out phenomenally, and I had a great time. That said, the material is very jumpy -- even the lecturer switches week to week, so it's challenging to feel like you're learning anything coherent. It's a great excuse to read a ton of books you might not otherwise get to, however, but be aware that in a more focused course you might get more out of them. If you're not going to do the readings (you can get away with it, but not easily) don't take it. You will get exactly nothing out of it.</comment>The reading is manageable and the faculty is great.  Fantastic course for freshman who admire the common core at other schools.</comment>Take this class. It's definitely a lot of reading, but you'll form a certain bond with the people in your section because you've struggled through the same books. Aside from the people in your section, the amazing professors definitely make the course. They generate so much enthusiasm for the texts and are so accessible to talk with you about your reactions to the book or anything else. I loved my section because my professor let us determine what elements of the book we wanted to talk about, and he would ask guiding questions to help us make connections between them. We also wrote weekly responses online where we'd respond to both the book and to each other. The section TF would provide really in-depth feedback to these responses which really helped improve my writing when it came down to completing the essays. Coming from a non-humanities concentrator, I thought the course was amazing and helped me become a better reader and writer. If you don't resist what all this course has to offer but jump in with both feet, the readings, responses and section discussions will become the highlight of your week.</comment>Do not take this course if you have any other life outside of sitting in a library reading.  I am extremely interested in these works and think that there is an incredibly better way to tackle them.  I felt like I could not actually engage with any of these texts and that it was a waste of time to take this course rather than just reading them on my own.  There wasn't much I got out of this course that made it better than having just done my own reading.   The teaching support is great but it is hard to do this class if you don't have all your time to dedicate to this course.</comment>If you like or even tolerate reading, take this class!</comment>Incredible lectures, office hours- take advantage of office hours and lunches.</comment>READ THE BOOKS. I shirked some of the reading and regretted it. Not because it hurt me in the class (you can get away with it...shhhhh). But because I was wrong to miss the opportunity to absorb all I could about EACH of these books. I would give this class enough weight in your schedule; don't pile up stuff around this and treat this as the easy course — you'll wanna dedicate all the time you can to reading these books.</comment>The only way to really get the most out of this class is to read the books, which is hard to do because you only have a week per work and if you have a heavy schedule it can be overwhelming.</comment>This is a class where what you put into it is what you get out of it. If you are prepared to read a book a week, think deeply about complex topics of literature, participate in discussion, and go to professor office hours, then this class is absolutely amazing. I have a deep sense of accomplishment in finishing this class and realizing all that I have read and learned.</comment>What will you do with your life? Does anyone care? Do you want to know? Then join the conversation. People have struggled with the same ideas you have since they have started writing. True, reading may be difficult, but with the help of multiple professors and a great section led by one of them, the minimum you can achieve in this course is more than enough to help you realize that you are not alone in the struggle of living. If you're hesitating, dare to take up the challenge and strive to seek for truth – don't worry, it has a happy ending!</comment>This course was the highlight of my first semester. The roster of professors is superb; ANY chance you can find to get to know them is a chance you need to take, and the TFs (Taylor in particular) are not only great about facilitating section discussion and working with you for feedback on your assignments but about holding office hours to talk about everything from what you're reading that week to their experience with a given department or program. The support system is unreal.</comment>Be ready to read a lot and discuss what you read for two classes before moving on.  Definitely a valuable class for anyone who wants to be exposed to some of the most important literature of our culture, but don't expect to get much more than a brief exposure.</comment>Take the class, but don't necessarily expect to do well.</comment>A challenging, very fast-paced, in-depth look at the works of the Western cannon, building toward the reading of Joyce's Ulysses for the final paper. Be prepared to spend a lot of time reading and thinking independently about the course's material--with the volume of material covered per week so large, section discussion time will be packed and ultimately insufficient to cover even half of the interesting, important points in any given work! Definitely more for concentrators or lovers of literature than students looking for a low-commitment GedEd. Humanities 10a will require a high input of time and effort, but its returns will be well worth the investment.</comment>The best class here!</comment>While the required reading is overwhelming at times, it is definitely worth it as I felt I got the most out of the weeks where I read most thoroughly. It makes lecture and discussion all the more valuable when you come in with a foundational understanding of the work that can be built on. There is no doubt that this course takes time, but you will learn so much if you put the time in and commit to the works!</comment>PLEASE READ: I came to Harvard as a definite English major, and I had read over 500 books.  However, this class absolutely knocked the life out of me.  We were literally expected to read a lengthy and difficult book and write a response paper every week, plus write three long papers.  While a noble goal, this was completely overwhelming.  Freshman fall is incredibly stressful, and this class sucked away all of my already-nonexistent free time.  I never once used SparkNotes in high school, and LITERALLY EVERY SINGLE STUDENT survived on SparkNotes for this class.  However, this could be awesome if you have the time to actually read the books and your other classes are super easy!</comment>Be prepared to do a lot of reading, but it will definitely change your perspective of narration and literature in the Western Canon.</comment>Loved it! Taylor Cowdery's the best!</comment>If you are at all interested in literature, books, or culture in general, take this course.  This course was largely responsible for me switching from a STEM trajectory to a Humanities concentration, and I know I am not alone in that.  The professors are all experts in the texts taught, offer unique persepctives on them, and sections are exemplary of what a good section should be like:  engaging, supplementary to lecture material without tedious review, and generally fun.  Take this course, because it does what CS50 did for computer science, but with the humanities -- and does so much more effectively.</comment>This is an amazing class. Take advantage of it and keep up with the readings, because section is so rewarding and I wish I had kept up better so I could have gotten even more out of the discussions. Lectures are also engaging and interesting.</comment>Not worth it. This class is as mechanical and bland as any introductory science/math/social science lecture class. If you want to study these works, take seminars in their respective departments. The course moves so extremely fast that you barely have time to scratch the surface (and I mean this quite seriously) before you are whisked away to another monumental work that you will not get anything out of. If you are not a freshman, be warned. This class is very much geared toward first years.</comment>Take this course if you want to learn from some of the strongest professors at the college and read the best texts Western tradition has to offer. However, realize that the course is not perfect. Often the reading load is too much and you may begin to find, as I did, that you don't need to do all the reading to do well in section. When it comes time to write papers, you may begin to see that the obscurity of an argument is regarded more highly than its strength. I am not going to take Hum10b, but I'm really glad I took Hum10a.</comment>This course will involve a significant amount of work to adequately comprehend the material.  Be prepared to spend quite a lot of time devoted to that.</comment>This course is challenging, but engaging. It's an ambitious undertaking: 2500+ years of western intellectual history in one semester. The paper grading is not lenient, and the sections are sure to challenge your assumptions. This class will help you to connect with a deep literary tradition, one that shapes everything about our experience in the modern, western world. In that sense, Hum10 is the essential Harvard course, a must take in your ivy league career.</comment>I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is willing to do all of the reading and really intellectually engage with the class. If you are unsure of your commitment and don't think you would do all or most of the reading, I would recommend taking a different class, because so much of what you will get out of this class is in the material.</comment>During the very first lecture for Hum 10a, Professor Greenblatt spoke mystically about the earliest form of artwork-- hand paintings etched in the French Chauvet-Pont-d'Arc Cave.  Our ancestors wanted to create, to transcend the ephemeral through their creations. 

“Why?”, he asked.

Take this course because you are interested in the “Why”. Because you are interested in gaining a more nuanced appreciation of art and its centrality to human existence.

Hum 10a not an easy A; there is much reading, writing, and the professors/TF’s have high standards. 

Through Hum 10a, I’ve engaged with multiple answers to the question of “Why?.” Through Professor Roilos’s lecture on the Symposium, I’ve come to appreciate the various Forms; we are all climbing the Ladder of Love, yet occupy different rungs. Through Professor Greenblatt’s lecture on Hamlet, I’ve come to appreciate Shakespeare’s emphasis on the character’s interior; thoughts can supplant plot in a story. Through Professor Simmons’s lecture on Descartes, I’ve come to appreciate the relationship between the mind and body; is the soul’s existence contingent upon the physical? Through Professor Menand’s lecture on Rousseau’s Confessions, I’ve come to appreciate the vulnerability evident in an autobiography--the vulnerability needed to respect the “integrity of nature.” Through Professor Claybaugh’s lecture on Jane Austen’s use of free indirect discourse, I’ve come to appreciate the novel’s contributions to making the interior accessible to audiences rather than relegated solely to Shakespearean soliloquies.  

As someone who loves politics and literature, I loved this course because the professors accounted for what George Orwell deemed “political impulse.” Every writer, I’ve come to realize, whether intentionally or otherwise, is motivated by “desire to push the world in a certain direction, to alter other people’s idea of the kind of society they should strive after.” All writing has political purpose. To say that art should not be political is a political statement in itself.

In short, this course made me a much better person. For that reason, I highly recommend it.</comment>This course was by far the best of my freshman fall.  It was consistently interesting and engaging, and truly was the kind of course Harvard likes to flaunt--working with and learning from a true faculty member with a serious pedigree.  I would recommend to anyone, regardless of interests.  This seems like it could be a flagship course for the University--the humanities' response to CS50.</comment>Try to read all the books in detail. They all are amazing, and the lectures as well. It is sometimes difficult to finish the books in the busy Harvard schedule, but without reading them, it will be difficult to learn how literature developed over time clearly.</comment>This class is a personalized introduction to the field of humanities. It's a chance to get feedback on your own skills and potential within several disciplines. You might think you know what you want to study, but that study probably takes a different form at a higher level than what you're used to, and this class is here to introduce you to those differences.</comment>Hum 10a with Professor Greenblatt was a wild ride.

Professor Greenblatt and Taylor were the most caring, warm, accessible, friendly, kind teachers a student could ask for. Add brilliant to that list and you've got a winning combination. They guided section every week deftly and diligently, often relating the week's text to some broad, lofty theme in literature (or life) that would leave me staggered by the implications. (Do note that this is by necessity and design a survey course, and so it focuses far more on the forest than the trees.) This was the case even when I was not fond of the readings or hadn't done them in much depth: after reading Rousseau, which I was not particularly fond of, we had an eye-opening discussion of subjectivity/objectivity within literature, and after reading Ulysses, which I definitely for sure read every single word of in the two weeks we were allotted, we talked about the representation of consciousness within literature. Both fascinating topics which had me utterly rapt. And of course I got even more out of section when I did justice to the readings, which I'd obviously recommend as they're all lynchpins of the Western canon.

Hum 10a also fosters a great community. I got to know everyone in my section decently well this semester, and a couple of them are now my very close friends. Everyone in section was very bright and eager and curious, which just made for an excellent group. I don't know whether it's the selective nature of the course (which I'm not particularly fond of, but I suppose it's necessary given that professors run the sections) or the self-selecting nature of the students, but Greenblatt section had a wonderful dynamic going on that I'll sorely miss.

There are also some ancillary aspects of the course that are super awesome. Prof Greenblatt and Taylor were super accessible, and I had a bunch of enlightening conversations, concerning literature, life, and their many intersections, with them outside of class. The Hum 10a staff also set up a bunch of very nice events (e.g. visits to the MFA/Houghton library, a performance of Lear, etc.) for students that give a nice glimpse of what it means to live the humanistic life.

tl;dr Hum 10a was exhilarating. Take it.</comment>It is a ton of reading!!! That needs to be said up front. It will take you a long time to read and absorb everything that this course throws at you. However, it is an extremely rewarding experience that you will learn a lot from. The intimate interaction with tenured faculty in the humanities is an unparalleled opportunity.</comment>This was a great gateway humanities course taught by amazing professors. If you are interested in pursuing anything in the humanities in the future, or if you are concentrating in the sciences but want some exposure to the humanities, this is the perfect class for you. The texts are worth reading for life. Lecture was so engaging and interesting. At times section discussion was a bit stilted because of students grandstanding, but nevertheless worth it. If you take this class, the only way you will get the most of it is by actually doing the readings. For those of us who actually did all of the readings, the workload was incredibly high. The course offers numerous resources, and all of the professors hold office hours and lunches after their lectures. Take advantage of these opportunities. The TFs were also awesome resources. Finally, the course offered several free field trips/events outside of the classroom – do them! I could not have asked for a better way to explore the cultural hotspots in Boston during my freshman fall.</comment>This class focuses on background and context of the works in lectures.  It is an intro course, so you will read a lot and not get a chance to learn too much about any text.  I personally like more literary analysis and discussion of the text itself, so got bored with the huge focus on context and background of the works.  I wanted to talk about the works themselves!  The paper topics were so broad that I felt I never got to dig in and find something I loved to write about.  Overall, I wish I would have taken a more intense english class.  This class is absolutely challenging, but not the kind of challenging I wanted it to be.  It just wasn't really for me.</comment>This class is really hard but worth it if you put the work in. I stopped being able to do all of the reading towards the end, so it became an exercise in reading and writing about summaries, and sections were hard to participate in.</comment>It's a great class, but a bit too excessive on the reading which really takes away from the impact of the course.</comment>This class requires a familiarity with many works of literature and an ability to comfortably write about and discuss literature. It is not an introductory level humanities class. Also the section is supposed to be the highlight of the class but Professor Roilos' section is awful and will ruin the class.</comment>Hum10 is an incredible course if you have genuine interest in the humanities - either as a concentration or just in general. It takes a lot of time and effort, but can be truly rewarding and inspiring if you are committed. The professors are passionate and really care about your experience - they want you to love the texts each week and therefore really make them come alive in lecture. Harvard seems to have pulled together some of its best to run this class. That said, if you don't put in the effort, this class will likely move too quickly and broadly for you to really appreciate what you're learning. You cover many millenia-- you have to be paying attention to see how it all connects together. Professors are highly accessible outside of class and their office hours definitely had the highest attendance of any I've encountered. My TF (Taylor) was also excellent in making me feel comfortable and really pushing me to think further and more carefully about all my ideas and assumptions. One negative component to this class was a sense of competitiveness-perhaps this is just a general Harvard phenomenon, but in section it often felt like people were just trying to show off for the benefit of the professor and the other students. Section was not the free and thoughtful opportunity it might have been. In general, I would definitely recommend this class if you have a general interest in the humanities, a desire to gain a very broad sense of the Western tradition, and a real commitment to pushing yourself hard each week.</comment>It is incredible. If you have the chance to take it, definitely do. It is true that it only offers voices from a piece of the Western literary tradition, but that restriction only means that it's essential to find courses like it that explore other pieces of other traditions. The meaning in these works is very real, from a literary standpoint and from a human standpoint.</comment>Taking this course was the best academic choice I made my first semester, and I cannot wait to continue on to Humanities 10b. Not only are the professors involved insightful and engaging, but they are excited to interact with the students. There are ample opportunities, through lunches, office hours, and field trips, to get to know those teaching and those taking the course. The course materials, carefully chosen, are truly essential works. They are excellent representatives of the western literary tradition. The variety in time period, culture, and perspective of the works, I think, gives students the foundation for a true literary education.</comment>You have to be willing to read early and read a lot. If you are, this class will be fantastic. Being able to be in small section will professors who are rockstars like greenblatt and menand is a once in a lifetime experience. Every college student should read these books. Also, the field trips are very fun.</comment>If you're planning to enroll in this course, you definitely should love reading and writing.</comment>I would recommend this class with enthusiasm to those willing to really put in the hours to read and think about one substantial work a week. If you are willing to put in this effort, the professors and texts are worth it!</comment>This class is great if you are hoping to read the classics. You will learn from legends, be challenged in your literary and philosophical analysis and learn to think about works in their cultural/historical context. All wonderful things! Be prepared that this is not an easy gen Ed class. To the contrary, it was the hardest class I had this semester from a workload and writing standpoint. You will think and read and write and be stretched in all those capacities. If that sounds like a noble challenge, charge into it head on. I'm glad I took the course.</comment>You will get the most out of this class if you dedicate yourself to the readings, if you participate in section, and if you attend the out of class events.</comment>This class is a great way to read amazing literary works that might be difficult to find time to read otherwise. Although it was difficult to keep up at times, I am incredibly pleased with all that I've accomplished over one semester.</comment></course>FRSEMR 25q: Understanding Emotions</title>You will certainly be able to learn about emotions, as stated in the seminar description. However, this class is mostly reading and discussing, and there is not much other activity that makes the class interesting. You might find simply listening to your professor and answering questions boring - if so, this class is probably not going to be engaging for you. If you are passionate about learning about emotions through intensive reading, I highly recommend this class.</comment>The class was a great experience. I learned a lot about my emotions and emotions in general. Dr. Leeds is an amazing teacher and keeps the class interesting and fun.</comment>It is quite interesting</comment>Coming into the class, I had no background knowledge from psych classes, but I loved this class! I highly recommend it to anyone. Not only will you learn about emotions in the classroom, but you will gain skills that are applicable to your daily life.   Advice: Read the readings! They are fascinating! Be interactive and creative with the papers. If you write about power posing, ask your friends to power pose for you and then include that in your paper if you want. Either way it is entertaining to make your friends power pose in the yard.  Have fun with this class. As a seminar, it is not meant to be stressful.</comment>In terms of introspection, especially as freshmen in the first semester of college, this course provides a lot of additional value to the already interesting material.</comment>This was a great course! The workload was totally manageable, and the material is interesting and relevant to everyday life.</comment></course>ANTHRO 1250: The Pyramids of Giza: Technology, Archaeology, History: Seminar</title>Good class. Attendance is taken however. After your in class project, it will feel like there is no need to attend class.</comment>loved this class! really cool topic and as long as you do the requirements, Prof Maneulian is great.</comment>A different class which is good to mix up other classes with. It has a different structure and the content is interesting. Only thing is that it can get a bit tedious at times.</comment>Excellent course based on content, instructor, and media used. Would take another course offered by the same instructor in a heartbeat.</comment>This course is s very interesting modern take on s very ancient time. It is truly incredible what the ancient Egyptians were able to accomplish and this course will give you such s greater appreciation for their civilization.</comment>Be aware that over half of the classes are taught by students. It's still very interesting, but I wish Professor Manuelian taught more.</comment>The 3D component of the class was very cool, but I wish there was more of it to take advantage of the unique room the class was taught in.  Additionally, the class is taught largely by the students, which wasn't that helpful all of the time.</comment>Very easy and interesting, especially if you want to learn more about Egypt than we learned in elementary school!</comment>if you have any interest in egypt at all, take this class! the incorporation of the 3d model is incredible, and one of those opportunities you'll only get at harvard. The discussions were relevant and interesting, and student presentations engaging. i would definitely recommend!</comment>The Professor does not teach the class, the students do. I felt duped, and cheated by the class. Very little feedback or idea of how I was doing. Would not recommend. It was a waste of a credit.</comment>This is a really interesting course with a great professor and engaging material.</comment>Great class; professor basically needs you as unpaid labor for his Egypt research but his research is pretty cool and the class is actually AMAZING for all the stuff he shows you in 3D. Worth it.</comment>This is great course if you have any interest in Egypt. The course load is very manageable, making it an enjoyable elective. With that said, a good portion of the course is student presentations. If you don't enjoy those, you may not enjoy the class as much.</comment>This course is great. Professor Manuelian is really passionate about Giza and it comes through in class. I took this as an elective and I'm glad I did.</comment></course>PHIL 97: Tutorial I</title>This tutorial exposed me to problems I might not have otherwise explored, and with James' guidance, I became a better philosophy student in the process.</comment>Phil 97 depends great on who your TF is and how they create their course. If you want a course that emphasizes discussion then look for sections which emphasize that. If you want a course that emphasizes writing (which you should) then look for courses that make you at least weekly so that your thoughts can be brought into focus for discussion.</comment>If you're looking for a really intimate setting in which to discuss philosophy, this class is for you! You'll be writing and reading quite a bit, but it's definitely a class worthwhile to take. One of the best parts is the small class size (7/8 people), and the really detailed feedback you get on all your papers.</comment>Well-designed class. Most of the material is very engaging, although papers are tough and discussions are sometimes difficult to get into.</comment></course>ITAL Aa: Beginning Italian I: Pathways to Italy</title>This class was fun. Intro language classes really tend to depend on the instructor.</comment>This class was engaging and fun, difficult though.</comment>If you are interested in learning the Italian language, this class is perfect for you. This is not necessarily the easiest course because learning a language is not the easiest thing to do. But, if you are willing to put the effort and time into mastering the material it can be a rewarding course.</comment>Great TFs, great coursework material. If you want to learn Italian this is a relatively painless way to get started. Going to class 4 hours a week feels like a lot but our section ended up getting pretty close by the end of the semester! I'm definitely planning on taking Ab. While this class doesn't have a ton of work, it comes pretty regularly, so there isn't a ton of flexibility for getting things done on your own time. If you have other classes that are more regularly (as opposed to periodically) demanding, you might want to consider how to manage your time schedule. Relatively low workload, high reward: understanding Italian.</comment>John Welsh is a good teacher. Not sure if there is better, but you will not go wrong with him.</comment>There is a fair amount of busy work in this class, and not having spoken a Romance Language it was a bit difficult at times, but I enjoyed the class.</comment>Shop all TFs to find one you can learn best from. Also review the material your going to learn the next day the night beforehand.</comment>Please make sure you shop all the sections that might potential fit your schedule. Keep in mind that the class is taught completely in section, and not all Harvard graduate students teach well! I had to learn everything from the textbook and still go to class for four hours a day. It was extremely frustrating. Also, make sure you get enough feedback on your work. Email your TF if he/she is not giving you back your homework assignments, tests, and quizzes. 
I had experiences in learning two other foreign languages prior to taking this class. I would simply suggest self-teaching the basics and enroll in an intermediate level class if you're motivated enough to do so.</comment>Italian is a beautiful language, and the class itself is great! Ceil is a wonderful TF, and the class itself is intimate and fun. I just wanted to hop on a plane and fly to Italy after every class. The assignments are also generally fun, but some could be annoying and too long. However, keep in mind that this is not an easy class and is a very decent amount of work. I would highly recommend everyone pick up Italian as a language, though; it really is beautiful!</comment>very engaging class. not too hard but requires a lot of energy to keep up with activities during and out of class.</comment>Italian is a cool but not very useful language, and it will take more than just an intro course to become proficient.</comment>Its really fun and a cool language</comment>This is a great class that is an effective and fun way to learn Italian. I loved starting my day with it. As an HDRB concentrator, almost all of my classes so far have been large lectures. I enjoyed having a small class with lots of interaction. Each class was different and the lessons were effective. I had a great time in this class. I felt like I learned things but it was very low stress and balanced the rest of my schedule well.</comment>This class was fine - a solid introduction to Italian (which, by the way, is a beautiful language). There were some assignments where it was unclear what the educational value was relative to the required effort. Still, class was not too stressful, and usually fun. I wish there had been some way to know that the textbook for this class basically non-negotiably costs $200+ (it's important to buy it new because it comes with a code for a mandatory online workbook) - it was a source of stress once I had already enrolled in the class, and I might not have taken it in that case.</comment>Be careful which TF you chose since they can make all of the difference in what kind of experience you will have throughout the semester</comment>If you are looking to satisfy a language requirement or become a more interesting person, Italian is a fun way to do so! The language and culture is beautiful, the class is engaging and well taught, and if you have already studied other romance languages nothing here will surprise you.</comment>I really enjoyed this class! You really get an opportunity to immerse yourself in Italian for an hour 4 times a week, and you get to explore language, music, and culture in an awesome way.</comment>Class is both engaging and informative.</comment>Be prepared to do almost all of the learning on your own, as you will not learn much in class if you are not able to understand or get feedback from your instructor.</comment></course>GOV 2710: International Relations: Field Seminar</title>No surprises.</comment></course>AFRAMER 117x: Of Mean Streets and Jungle Fevers: Race, Gender and Ethnicity in Martin Scorsese and Spike Lee</title>The films are incredibly interesting and have a lot of potential for deep thought relating to issues of race, gender, and sexuality. There's not too much work involved at all, but maybe be wary of the fact that only two papers count as your entire grade.</comment>Go to class to watch the films. You don't have to but I found it easier to actually go to class and watch the films than watch them in my own time. Very low key class. One short paper for the midterm, and another slightly longer paper for the final. Do the reading because they are interesting. You don't need to though. I enjoyed the class</comment>Only take it if you're self-motivated in topics.</comment>Take it. Great films - no work. You learn a lot by hardly doing anything.</comment>Enjoy the films and really wrestle with the questions that they raise.</comment>Prof BJ is the man... and so is TF Ernie! Good class. Chill watch 2 movies then have a lecture on them. The readings were really interesting although i'm not sure how many people did them. Section with Ernie was amazing.</comment>Excellent class. Light workload and the professor and TF's were great.</comment>Very interesting course that forces you to sit back and think critically about two filmmakers you would think have nothing in common. That being said, you take out what you put in with this course. You can just coast, but if you actually pay attention to what Professor Jeyifo is saying, you will realize he is actually proposing a series of very articulate and very deep assertions about the films we studied. And in that light, I highly recommend this course.</comment>Very easy class, requires very little time. Movies are very interesting and papers are short and easy.</comment>Great course to get an inside view into two of the most prolific directors the movie industry has ever produced.</comment>This is an amazing class for those who love film. If you've always wanted to watch Scorsese or Lee, this is a great opportunity to view some of their best work. Also there is very little work (only two papers) and you get to watch great movies in class. The lecture can be a bit dry but it can still be extremely helpful for your papers.</comment>It's a great introduction to the films of Scorsese and Lee. If you are interested in developing or even just learning about film analysis, take this course! It's painless and applicable to real life.</comment>the films are great and it will change the way that you look at films in the future</comment>The movies are great, but the staff is somewhat unorganized, yet they will hypocritically expect you to take the course very seriously. Regardless, not a ton of work and it provides a great excuse to watch the work of Lee and Scorsese.</comment>Many students take this course because they've heard it's very easy and unfortunately don't get much out of it. Don't be that student. Well at least the latter part. Of course many students do need a lighter course to balance their schedules. But don't be the student to not get anything out of this course. It really is fascinating stuff! Not just the films themselves, but what the filmmakers (Lee and Scorsese) are saying to their audience. The analytical skills I've learned in this course have not only allowed me to watch movies in a whole new light, but think about life differently. The movies in this course were unique because the directors were doing innovative things for their eras, but because even today movies are not trying to portray messages about race, gender, class and so many other issues in America. With that being said, you definitely can bullshit this course if you choose to. But you can also choose to engage with the knowledge and analytical skills being given to you and get a lot out of it.</comment>Great film selection; professor Jeyifo is incredibly knowledgable and you're guaranteed to learn something new each lecture; will get out what you put in.</comment>A must take for fans of either cinema or these two filmmakers.</comment>It's an awesome class, the movies are great and the TFs do a great job of discussing them.</comment>lectures were hard to understand. Section could be interesting sometimes, but often felt forced.</comment>Courseload is extremely light. Class meets only once a week, and every 2 out of 3 classes are film screenings. The third is a lecture/discussion on the films. There are only 2 papers for the entire course. One midterm paper, and one final paper.</comment>Best course I've had on film. Hadn't seen a Spike Lee film before, and I left the class loving him. Reading is unnecessary because we never really even discuss it. If this stays a two essay class (no midterm or final) then everyone should take this. It's easy and you come away with a better understanding of two master filmmakers.</comment>This class in super easy. It's a great class to balance with a hard schedule.</comment>Take the course! If you get Warrick as a TF be prepared to spend an hour every week just wondering where your life went wrong though this man is a time waster. Does not use section effectively in the slightest, which isn't too bad in a class like this where a lot of reflection from you is necessary (so it's not like a math course or something when if the section isn't teaching you you're done for) but it'd be nice to have meaningful discussion in section every now and then. It was too much for Warrick to handle though. He also consistently let us out late.</comment>Definitely take the course. It was the best film class I've taken at Harvard</comment>This a great course with a fairly easy workload. Professor Jeyifo is not a great lecturer, but his handouts are useful. Plus, you literally get to watch Scorsese and Spike Lee movies every week, which is super dope. The two essays are pretty easy as well.</comment>Great class. Great movies.</comment>Excellent material, great professor, and manageable workload. it doesn't get much better than this.</comment>Incredibly relaxed class but frustratingly disorganized</comment>It's a great low-stress class that will actually teach you something.</comment></course>CHNSE 107a: Intermediate Literary Chinese</title>Low pressure but helpful guide through Classical Chinese. You will learn Classical Chinese.</comment>This class is a lot of work but also a lot of fun!</comment></course>ANTHRO 1010: The Fundamentals of Archaeological Methods & Reasoning</title>It is not very interesting, but the exams are not that hard. Also if you are not a math student this is a great class to fulfill that requirement.</comment>If you are at all interested in archeology take this class. Great introduction to archeology and I would especially encourage it to freshman or sophomores who could change concentrations. I took it as a senior fall and I loved it. Really gives you a great look at how archeology is done and is a great introduction to the discipline</comment>This is a great class! The professors give very interesting lectures. I did not know anything about archaeology before taking the class, but now I am eager to learn more. Sections are equally amazing! Each section is basically a field trip. My favorite sections were the stone tool making and the pottery making. My only warning is that this class requires a lot of reading. The readings are all fairly interesting but some of them were extremely long.</comment>This class is really just an overview of a huge and broad subject, which can be both good and bad.</comment>This class is a truly amazing experience! The material is interesting and engaging and the sections are fabulous! The opportunities that you will have are like something out of a novel. I never imagined when I came to school in the fall that I would be holding a 1.6 million year old hand axe made by an ancestral human species. This class is definitely an opportunity that you won't get at many other schools, so don't pass it up! It is not difficult to succeed as long as you keep up with the readings and do the section assignments. Although there is a fair amount of reading, the topics are always quite interesting, so you will always be fully engaged.</comment>If you very much don't want to do anything math-related in your undergraduate career this is an easy if not irrelevant way to fulfill an EMR requirement. Also, if you think you're interested in anthro but not really sure, this is a decent way to gauge it. (For me, both of these things left me a bit wanting, but that's just because of a change of interests midway through the semester).</comment>This class is an easy class to get through if you show up to lecture/section.  It is only demanding if you don't pay attention.</comment>You might think taking Anthro 1010 is just a way to fulfill a Gen Ed or that archaeology isn't a worthwhile subject, but it's actually very interesting and I'm really glad I took the class.</comment>This class is a great way to fulfill a GEN-ED, with some interesting sections and a few interesting lectures. It's also an easy class. If you'll feel bad about throwing away a real math class in favor of an exploration into the world of archaeology, don't take it. If you are looking for a guys-in-hats-in-the-desert party, take ANTHRO 1010.</comment>This class is a great intro into archaeology and a great way to get the EMR Gen Ed out of the way with NO math whatsoever. The sections are really fun and hands on, you'll be doing something new each week which I always really looked forward to. The section assignments aren't too hard. The readings can be a bit long and boring but you don't have to read them all to get the gist of what is going on. Would definitely recommend taking it if you have any interest in anthropology or archaeology. It has definitely played a role in my decision to take on a secondary concentration in archaeology.</comment>This class is extremely interesting. It gives you the opportunity to understand the past and our ancestors through looking at the things they left behind. The lectures are engaging but a little fast paced, so be prepared to rapidly type or write your notes. The sections will be a real highlight in your week because you get the opportunity to apply the most interesting concepts touched upon in class.</comment>While this course did introduce us to archaeological methods, it was not structured very well. Lectures sometimes went off topic and the readings weren't particularly relevant to the course.</comment>You have to love writing</comment>It isn't a ton of work and section is very interesting. The weekly assignments are doable, but lecture isn't always super interesting.</comment>Anthro 1010 is a fantastic Gen Ed with great professors and a fascinating subject that a lot of people know very little about.</comment>I took this course primarily for the General Education credit it provides, and I thoroughly enjoyed it, although I had taken an archaeology course prior to this one and knew I enjoyed the subject. I think the course was excellent at improving critical thinking skills; the course focused heavily on epistemology in archaeology and asked us to be able to explain how we could "know" things about the past by looking at artifacts, art, written records, etc.  However, in comments for this course in previous years, I have noticed commenters saying that students should not take the course for the General Education credit if they are not interested in archaeology, and I would just like to echo that statement.  I doubt the course would be worth a student's time if the student really does not care for archaeology.</comment>This course is quirky and fun, but push the professors to help you prepare for the exams because this year the material on the exams was unexpected.</comment>The class was very fun and the sections meant that by the final I knew most of my grade so the pressure was off. It was fantastic fun and I learnt a lot but it wasn't at all stressful.</comment>It's a really interesting class if you like the material, however if you aren't into history you will hate the class. You have to like to think about life from new perspectives to also enjoy the enjoy the course.</comment>The lab sections alone make the class. However, I don't feel as if I learned much within the class itself and I felt as if the final and midterms referenced obscure terms/topic matters that were especially hard to learn if the powerpoints aren't posted online.</comment>Take the class if you are truly interested in the subject or must fulfill a math requirement. If you aren't passionate about it, it's tedious.</comment>This is an incredibly interesting class, but I would only take it if you are interested in pursuing archaeology as a concentration/secondary or need to fulfill a math requirement. Otherwise, there is no real incentive to take the class considering it does not fulfill any other General Education Requirements. It is not a time consuming class. The sections are absolutely great, however the follow up assignments are not always structured the best. The exams are very manageable, and the final is not cumulative for the whole year! The teaching staff is great, and their information from lectures make up the bulk of the exams. However, the readings are also crucial given that the lectures do not always go into enough depth on each topic.</comment>If you don't like math, use this to fulfill the EMR requirement.  Lectures are boring and not that helpful, but you should still go to them.  Do the reading and participate in section.  The exams will kill you if you aren't specific about case studies.</comment>There is a lot of reading, but the classes and sections are interesting</comment>This is the funnest possible way I could think to fulfill your math requirement, the resources for this class's sections are once in a lifetime (I touched a human skull!), and I really feel like I have a better understanding of how we know what we know about the past.</comment>This course is a fun introduction to archaeology. Lectures are interesting, readings are straightforward and useful, and section is always enjoyable and hands-on. Both specific details about and the broader themes of archaeology are discussed, and a good general overview of the field is provided (whether you have passing interest or a passion).</comment>Need a fifth class that will knock off a Gen. Ed.? This is a solid choice. Very accessible TF's. Lectures were a bit lacking but sections were great. The materials themselves were quite good too. Pay a lot of attention in section, and to section assignments, and this will be a very straightforward class.</comment>If you're looking for an EMR with no math, you've found it. This class was a great way to get rid of EMR without having to look at a single number all semester. It was enjoyable, the sections were usually somewhat fun, the lectures were pretty engaging, and the work was pretty simple and straightforward.</comment>It is actually an introduction to archeology presented in a way that Indiana Jones would do. I am a Science-focused person concentrating in CS and I find that this class is just perfect to learn about a great deal of a history in a very interesting way - instead of studying the life of kings and battles which History focuses on Anthro 1010 will show you what the everyday life throughout the centuries looked like because through the excavation it investigates the realities of individuals underrepresented in a written record such as slaves or peasants. What I particularly liked is that it actually teaches you how to excavate, how to look for the sites and that, sadly, Indiana Jones movies do not necessarily illustrate archeologists' daily lives.</comment>If you are interested in archaeology, or you are simply dismal at math, this course is a godsend for you.  Overall, it is not terribly difficult, it has really fun and interesting sections (field trips to graveyards, the ceramics studio, stone-tool making, bone analysis) and it involves literally no math at all.  

This year it was co-taught by Professors Ur and Tryon.  Tryon was not my cup of tea: his lectures were disorganized, making handwritten notes impossible to format logically, and he has a habit to ramble, while also mumbling, which makes note-taking rather laborious. He is very fun, though and quite knowledgeable of course.

Ur I liked a lot. His lectures were smooth and logical and he is quite engaging.

The TF's (Max and Sadie) are both awesome. Shoutout to Max for being so nice and always so helpful.

The average reading, including sections, was 147 pages per week (that is, about 75 pages per lecture).  The tests are ridiculously easy, so don't kill yourself studying.

Fair warning: the reading that they assign is like my mom's fruit bars: dense and incredibly dry.  You do not need to know even half of the random details the textbook includes. ***GO TO OFFICE HOURS BEFORE THE MIDTERM AND EXAM: your TF's will tell you what is important and what you don't need to worry about***

If you are interested in archaeology, this class is for you! And if not, it is still quite fun and if you are aware that the reading isn't as integral as it may seem it is stress-free.</comment>Not worth taking for a gen ed.</comment>I enjoyed the varied course material (e.g. scholarly articles, textbook readings, videos, movie theater excursion), engaging professors and TFs and hands-on lab sections that Anthro1010 provided.</comment>Not only a fun, thought-provoking, informative course, but also a great way to fulfill the Math Gen Ed!</comment>This class is a fun introduction to anthropology and archaeology, but even if you're not interested in either of those fields, it is a great way to gain more experience in analytical thinking.</comment></course>HIST 1133: The British Revolutions</title>This class is fantastic! Kishlansky's lectures are packed with information, jokes, and trivia. You will learn so much about Britain, Protestantism, and the foundations of democracy through amazing stories and discussions! You will not regret taking this course.</comment>This class was phenomenal and unique, as far as I have experienced, among the courses offered. Professor Kishlansky is so passionate and truly an expert on this subject. His lectures are fantastic and I am very thankful that I had the opportunity to learn from him. It requires a fair amount of work, but once you figure out how to balance it, it should not be too stressful. It's been one of the best classes I've taken here!</comment>The readings are really interesting, but what really drives this course is the fantastic lecturing by Professor Kishlansky. The midterm is time-tight, so watch your time; the final is just a larger midterm.</comment>I do "highly" recommend this course, BUT for people that love history and/or those with a fascination in the Early Modern Period/English History/Stuart Period. The course is a lot about politics - I love politics so it was especially fascinating -- for those looking for economics or social history, you probably won't find that here.</comment>The lectures are great, Professor Kishlansky is very engaging. However, the exams require a lot of memorization (I.D.'s) and the supplementary readings for section can sometimes be long and tedious.</comment>Professor Kishlansky is a master of prose. His ability to tell history as the engaging narrative it can and should be is exceptional in my experience of teaching at Harvard. Take this class and learn the history and how to tell a good story.</comment>This is a great class! Kishlansky is a great teacher and you learn a lot. The workload is very manageable and the tests are very fair.</comment></course>NEUROBIO 101hfa: Novel Therapeutics in the Central Nervous System</title>Not useful at all, hoping to get a more in-depth view of CNS and diseases but walked out of the semester with virtually no gain in knowledge.</comment>Catherine is great - very engaging and knows what she's talking about. This is a great option for your tutorial.</comment>There's more writing than I had expected, but it's an interesting class!</comment>Class is really informal,which is nice. Catherine knows the material really well, so she can explain a lot of the new ideas that are out there.</comment></course>HEB 1351: Reproductive Ecology</title>great class! very interesting material. mainly physiology at the beginning (which i loved) and then the second two units were the ecology part of the course (energetics and lactation, etc) which was also interesting, but was a little bit repetitive but still great to learn about and discuss. The midterms are fair and the final paper is pretty open so you can really enjoy it. Lara is great.</comment>This is a relatively low workload course (no section) and peaks in work around exam time. It was difficult toward the end of the course because you have an exam immediately after Thanksgiving and then a paper due just about a week later. The readings are not very long and are interesting; you do have to do them, as you have to submit two discussion questions per class.</comment>This is a great class and I learned a lot, but it does focus on quite a specific topic, so just make sure you are really interested in that. If you are, you will have a great semester. The workload is very reasonable, the assignments are fair, and Lara is great!</comment>This class is interesting and organized. There isn't usually an overwhelming amount of reading, although the readings can be very dense. The exams require a lot of memorizing and sometimes are graded a bit harshly.</comment>For anyone interested in the reproductive system this is the class for you. The material itself is very interesting and there are a lot of different topics within this discipline. Lara is also great about meeting with people and talking about other studies that have been done.</comment>interesting class, but be prepared to memorize and regurgitate everything on the slides for exams</comment>This is an amazing course, one of the best I have taken at Harvard and definitely one of the highlights of being an HEB concentrator. Lara did an incredible job of taking the complicated anatomy and physiological processes underlying the entirety of reproduction and explaining it in a way that both made sense and allowed me to easily pick up the relevant terminology. The three exam format may seem daunting, but it really helps you stay on top of the material and the paper at the end of the semester is really enjoyable if you pick a topic you are interested in. I would definitely, highly recommend this course!</comment></course>ENG-SCI 268: Chemical Kinetics</title>It's a pretty small class (N = 4), so get ready to be 25% of the discussion.</comment></course>MUSIC 14hfr: Harvard-Radcliffe Collegium Musicum</title>Go to rehearsals and have fun!</comment>If you're already singing in the Collegium, there's no reason not to take it as a course to get credit for the rigorous work that you do!</comment>Great opportunity to sing at a high standard. Turnover of pieces, however, may be too slow for some people. Means less sightreading practice than could be possible. You may go weeks singing the same pieces to prepare for a concert.</comment>Collegium has been the most rewarding experience of my college career thus far. This is an opportunity to meet some amazing people who will become great friends, join a community of other singers on campus, and all the while make some of the most beautiful music there is together. Time commitments for rehearsal are not terribly demanding and there are a ton of fun social activities throughout the year. There is also the opportunity to take on a role in helping manage the choir, which provides a ton of great experience. Audition for Holden and join Collegium!</comment>Take this option for Collegium if you want a pass/fail class for whatever reason. Since this counts as a course, you could take it with a difficult semester of other classes, only requiring three actual courses for one semester!</comment>Collegium is wonderful- it is not too much of a time commitment, it counts as an extracurricular as well as a course, the music is amazing, and the Holden Choruses are a warm and welcoming community.</comment>It's so much fun! Collegium is such a wonderful community.</comment>Collegium is filled with some of the best people you'll meet during your time at Harvard.</comment>HRCM is a really incredible choir. This is my 4th year in the choir and I absolutely adore our repertoire and conductors. However, our repertoire is definitely very different from that of most of the a cappella groups on campus, so I highly recommend attending the preview performance at the beginning of the year or looking into some of the choir's past repertoire. I absolutely love the music we sing but fully acknowledge it is not appealing to every college undergraduate. The social aspect to this choir is really fun and I definitely feel I have a family in the other members of this choir. If you like our repertoire, you should definitely audition!!</comment>Collegium is the best group on campus! A wonderful community, and a great musical experience. Audition in the fall!</comment>If you're in Collegium, there's really no reason not to take it as a class!</comment>Collegium creates a remarkable sense of community while pushing your musicianship. Since starting with the group, I have hugely deepened my appreciation and understanding of a variety of composers and their musical eras.  In the College, it is a unique experience to learn both from your professor/conductor and from your peers in a collaborative environment.  It's a real privilege.</comment>Collegium has defined my college experience. You will be hard-pressed to find a group of people at Harvard more committed to musical excellence, supportive of full-body health and learning, and unconditionally loving.</comment>Join the Collegium! Such a wonderful music-making group. The passion for choral music is evident in each member, the community is phenomenal, and the repertoire fantastic.</comment></course>SPANSH 285r: Spanish Literature: Seminar: Filming the Text</title>If you are ready to do a lot of reading in Spanish, this class is fascinating.</comment></course>EXPOS 20.232: Sports and the Law</title>This is a really fun course that is very interesting and the Mr. Fobi is a great preceptor.</comment>This class is super fun and is a great way to fulfill the expos requirement. I personally enjoyed embedding my hobbies with an academic requirement because I had a greater interest in the topics that we discussed and wrote/read about.</comment>THIS IS ABSOLUTELY THE BEST EXPOS OUT THERE!!! This turned out to be my favorite class by far this semester, and Brian Fobi is AWESOME. List this as your first choice expos!</comment>Brian Fobi is just... wow</comment>Good expos class to take.</comment>It is a great choice for expository writing.</comment>Fobi is the best prof you could get. The class is very interesting and you learn a lot about sports. The course load starts off with a lot of reading but then it dies down quite a bit.</comment>This class is a fantastic class (especially for an Expos class). It was extremely enjoyable. The topic was really interesting, but even if you aren't interested in the law, Professor Fobi still makes the course really enjoyable. Take this course! It is extremely popular, however, so you really must put this course as your first choice in order to have any chance of getting in.</comment>This is a simple, yet interesting class.</comment>Sports and the Law is an excellent, and thus very popular, course. If you like sports and have an opinion on contemporary issues you will love this class. Fobi keeps it real and is a great guy as well as an excellent teacher. Take this class if you know whats going on in the world of professional (and amateur) sports and have an opinion on it. You don't have to want to be a lawyer and the class is not only for athletes, but you'll love this course if you're passionate about sports.</comment>SO AWESOME.</comment>We all have to fill the Expos 20 requirement and, while most people I know hated their expos classes, I loved this course. Professor Fobi is knowledgeable and passionate about the subject and immensely helpful in improving one's writing. Talking and writing about sports also gave me a fun lens through which to learn about academic writing.</comment></course>KOREAN 130a: Pre-advanced Korean</title>THIS IS A GREAT CLASS. If you've already made it through years one and two of Korean, take this again because A) you get Jung SSN who is amazing amazing amazing and B) you might as well because you've learned a lot already and in 130 you'll learn so much. 130 is where you begin to practice lots of reading, writing, speaking, and debating, and striving to get closer to native proficiency.</comment>Be prepared to study almost every day!</comment>This course is much more difficult than Korean 120, so just be prepared to make much more effort in studying and preparing for this class.</comment>The class material is a huge step up from Korean 120, but because of that, the learning environment is less encouraging and helpful for second-language-learners.</comment></course>APMTH 201: Physical Mathematics I</title>I would tell students that it is not as useful as it sounds! I definitely would not take this as a great useful math class that will be super helpful later on. I don't really think it will be that useful for me. It was an okay class, but if I were to only take one math class I think I may prefer to take a different one.</comment>This is an introductory course with a lot of chance to apply what you learnt to real problems.</comment>As an undergraduate I felt that this course was extremely accessible with Avi (Shapiro) and Mauricio (Santillana). The course is very self-contained and although they recommend differential equations and complex analysis, Avi and Mauricio taught everything that was needed from the prerequisites anyways. The course can essentially be called "Dominant Balance I." You learn a bunch of methods and theory but the ultimate takeaway is that you can APPROXIMATELY solve or check for any answer to any difficult problem using dominant balance and apply simple techniques to improve the answer.</comment>Useful stuff, although lectures were super boring...</comment>The techniques you learn since simple, but they are pretty powerful and useful.</comment>Class will be most useful if you use mathematical modeling in your research. Also, be sure you start your project early and define a reasonable problem with the instructors well before the due date.</comment>This is a great course! AM104 and AM105 are not really prereqs. Mauricio and Avi are great lecturers. I never felt stressed because of this course and yet learned a lot.</comment>AM 201 is a pretty good course without an excessive workload. All the psets are done in groups. My only criticism would be the lectures -- they're very disorganized, and often you're better off just reading the online notes.</comment>Applied Math 201 is an introduction to approximation methods with a focus on their applications in the sciences.  The workload was very reasonable.  Even during the semester I took the class, I found that the topics we learned helped me with my physics courses and directly impacted my research.  I would definitely recommend the course to students interested in theoretical physics.</comment>This is a great class to take if you are interested in getting to know how to use dominant balance to give good approximate solutions to problems that are hard to solve exactly otherwise. It is also really fun to work on psets in groups.</comment>Work load is kinda heavy, mostly group work for problem sets.</comment></course>TWI A: Elementary Twi</title>The teacher is very enthusiastic and has a very good knowledge of both twi and English. You learn a lot of vocabulary;, and although the classes can be a little fast/unorganized I felt I had a good foundation of the language at the end of the course.</comment>Twi A is great! The pacing of the class is beneficial to those who seriously want to take time to learn and ingest the language.</comment></course>FRSEMR 25x: Human Brain in Health and Disease: A Neurologist's Perspective</title>If you want to take a freshman seminar, are interested in neuroscience, want a low-stress setting to explore this academic interest, and get to know a physician in a teacher-student setting, then I strongly recommend this class. However, if you are looking for a science class that will teach you a substantial amount of defined material in neuroscience that you will definitely retain, wherein you feel like your furthering an interest that you have already somewhat cultivated before reaching Harvard, then I do not recommend this course. If this is what you are looking for, you probably would get more of a positive transformation out of the little time we spend at the end of the course discussing the philosophical aspect of the human brain more than the heavy neuroscience we go over for most of the course.</comment>Take this class.  If you are looking for a real freshman seminar experience, this is it. Dr. Byrne is an incredibly warm and caring mentor: in addition to the class he offers Friday morning brain-cutting at MGH, "office-hours" over meals in beautiful Eliot House, and a host of advice about almost anything you could want to know. One particular highlight of the semester was having a class over dinner at his lovely home with his wife, Susan Hockfield. (And he also invited all of us not going back home for the holidays to Thanksgiving dinner at his home!) In addition, in this class, you really get a good sense of "real science" by reading usually 2 high quality scientific articles per week and writing a 5 page paper on a topic of your choice at the end of the semester. Obviously this work is not too overburdening, but, in the end, you get out of the class what you put into it.</comment>This seminar is wonderful. Dr. Byrne is engaging, personable, and considerate. Our classroom discussions were always fun and interesting. I loved both the books we read for the class. Beyond the class topic, Dr. Byrne offers wonderful advice on life and pre-med help. We had a wonderful class dinner at his house and you can also go see a brain cutting at MGH!</comment>While the materials of the class are indeed interesting, what really makes this class special is Dr. Byrne. He encourages the class to have breakfast with him and go to brain cuttings at MGH with him. If you take the time to get to know Dr. Byrne and in turn make yourself known to him, this class will incredibly rewarding. We even had dinner at his home for class once!</comment>This course is extremely unique, and the lessons it teaches would be assets to any student, pre-med or otherwise. While the pure neuroscience lessons are interesting, the most valuable components of the course are in-class discussions and Dr Byrne's incredible insights into how the brain's anatomy gives rise to the mind. The class has sparked my interest in a number of different areas, from fMRI to philosophy, and I would highly recommend it to absolutely everyone!</comment>This is an exceptional class, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in how the brain works and why it works that way. You get to learn about several aspects of neurobiology that you wouldn't be able to otherwise until much later. I particularly enjoyed class discussions on the material, which had a tendency to cover not only neurobiology but also dip into ethics and philosophy.
The instructor is a great mentor and has put together a well-organized, engaging course; he takes the time out of his busy schedule to be accessible to his students and clearly wants to help his students in any way he can. Also, if you're curious about a specific part of how the brain functions (which it's hard not to be with the breadth of the material covered in this course), you'll have the opportunity to dive into it with the research paper at the end of this course.</comment>It's a great class, but expect the material to require some science background/knowledge.</comment>This is a great class. Definitely take it if you are interested in neuroscience and philosophy. Still take it if you are interested only in neuroscience, and not philosophy.</comment>Participate and there so much to be gained from the conversations in this class.</comment>This course is great for anyone with an interest in the mind, brain, and philosophy, and is a homeroom that will greatly help with the transition to college. Dr. Byrne is a knowledgeable and accomplished neurologist, and an inspiring mentor that fills classroom discussions with advice for college and life.</comment>This was my favorite class of the semester. Not only was it a valuable and enriching learning experience, the discussion part of the seminar was encouraging, and I felt comfortable around my classmates and Dr. Byrne. You WILL get more than you expect to learn in this class, and that can only be a good thing. However, you will only get as much as you put in, and I would suggest making the most of your opportunities!</comment>Dr. Byrne makes a great effort to get to know every one of his students.  To create a friendly environment, he welcomes open discussions and frequently asks us how we are managing our first semester at Harvard.  Additionally, he offers to meet with us for dinner/lunch to discuss whatever, and hosts dinner at his house for the entire class.  Not only are we given the option of dining with Dr. Byrne, but we are also offered the opportunity to experience a brain cut.</comment></course>SCI-PHYUNV 14: How to Build a Habitable Planet</title>If you are both a deep thinker and a scientific thinker, this clas will give you tons to ponder. It is not very hard math or science-wise, and can occasionally be disorganized. But the material and the way it is presented in section is awesome.</comment>This class sounds like it would be enjoyable but lectures are hard to follow and the reading is dense. The quiz and exam questions are incredibly difficult and require a solid handle on smaller topics to do well. Take this class with caution. If you're interested in the topic, take it. But if you want a doable SPU gen ed, this isn't it.</comment>This class should really be called "Total Recall." Expect very little critical thinking, and a lot of arbitrary lists to memorize and regurgitate on the exams. I wish it had included more problem-solving—it ended up just being a kind of memorization game, which I thought was pretty unfortunate.</comment>a lot of information, difficult material, definitely easier ways to fulfill gen-eds</comment>This course is not worth the time or effort. Lectures are abundant and it is difficult to keep with the pace of the class, as these lectures often seemed forced or pointless. Material is interesting, comprehensive, but in many ways useless outside of the classroom.</comment>Prof. Langmuir is very accessible to students. He is a good lecturer. He listens to students concern about this course in order to make it better. But, the amount of knowledge he wants to cover in a semester is too much. I felt overwhelmed.</comment>Go to office hours and this class won't be too bad.</comment>The book is very interesting but the class itself has no pedagogical integrity; Few academic experiences I have had have been so little in the spirit of true learning as this class was. The relentless preoccupation with testing, regurgitation, and false learning was truly disappointing.</comment>If you want to read hundreds of pages about rocks and chemicals, this is the class for you. Otherwise, steer clear - the tfs aren't engaged, the course is disorganized and frustrating, and the quizzes are much more difficult that is necessary relative to the actual material. The saving element for the course is how much Prof. Langmuir loves what he is talking about.</comment>Lectures are great, labs are self-explanatory, but exams are near impossible.</comment>It is a satisfying feeling to be able to understand a bit better how the universe gave rise to a habitable planet and beings like ourselves. I would recommend you attend lecture so you actually get some of the benefits of taking this class. Read the book occasionally so you're caught up and don't need to cram before quizzes. But if you understand the lecture and the book, you should do pretty well on quizzes and labs. Just don't expect a walk in the park, it's not all simple material.</comment>Great class, especially if you go to OH and do the reading</comment>Beautiful course. May seem like a strange word to describe the class, but the deep world understanding and appreciation you gain is truly beautiful. Makes you feel like a world citizen. VERY important course to take. Fresh perspective on the world/ universe, seeing that it's all just cycles of matter and energy. Prof. Langmuir is awesome -- very engaged and eager to help students.</comment>This course has pretty dry lectures, but if you have been in a science class in high school which you consumed a lot of information in a short amount of time, you will be fine. The material is very interesting, except there is this pretty dry section about rocks, but perhaps you will find it interesting? By the end of the course you have a pretty solid understanding of the universes workings, how the earth works, and the overall process of how life can sustain. You even get to research about currently economic issues at the end of the course.</comment>This class is interesting and important and Professor Langmuir really cares about the material and his students. However, this is not really an easy Gen Ed, especially as someone who had not taken a science class since high school. The quizzes are pretty tough and a lot of material is covered. You definitely need to read the book and go to lecture.</comment>I am very glad I took this course despite its many imperfections. The biggest mistake on the part of the teaching staff is that it often fails to realize that the students are lost in the extensive and somewhat arcane details. This could easily be remedied by doing a better job of distinguishing the essential v. the non-essential. At times, the course was unnecessarily time consuming and stressful. 
Nonetheless, the grand scope of the course material will undoubtedly broaden your perspective and give you an greater appreciation of planet Earth, life, and the universe.</comment>This is probably the best SPU option out there. Though it is a lot of material, it is actually interesting. Furthermore, if you're willing to put in the work, you will do well -- it is almost foolproof as long as you try consistently throughout the semester.</comment>I strongly discourage anyone from taking this course. I am not sure why this course previously received such high Q scores because I, along with most of the people in my section, found this class to be poorly taught and graded arbitrarily and unfairly. I found the quizzes to be very difficult and the TFs unable to explain key concepts and material. I went to office hours five times, but I did not find them to be very helpful. Professor Langmuir taught at a level that was above most of our heads and would get slightly impatient when we did not understand. I was lost most of the course and was only able to memorize all of the material in the last few days in the hopes of making a decent grade on the exam. If anyone were ever to ask me, I would say take any other class besides this one. honestly.</comment>This is a very good way to fulfill SPU if you are not very familiar with science. You learn a lot of useful and interesting things, and it doesn't feel like it's being dumbed down for you, but it's still easy to understand. A lot of the material is actually quite interesting. The course feels a bit poorly organized, however.</comment>GO TO OFFICE HOURS: They make you realize that you're not the only person struggling with the material. Langmuir answers questions in ways that make sense and you get extra points for going. 

Also, read the book and start studying early.</comment>I heard only bad things about this class, but I actually ended up enjoying it. The labs and quizzes weren't hard, the lectures are actually pretty interesting (definitely recommend going to them- otherwise you'll find little impetus to catch up), and Langmuir makes himself super available and is a great explainer.</comment>This is a very interesting class that takes you from the Big Bang, to the formation of the elements, to the beginnings of planet Earth, to now. I found the course enjoyable and the teaching staff to be accessible. Most people seem to be taking the class to fulfill their Gen Ed requirement, so in most cases, people generally start off at the same level. Professor Langmuir also has office hours multiple times a week, and seems very willing to answer questions and help clarify any confusion. The course material we use is Professor Langmuir's book, How to Build A Habitable Planet, and I thought it was an interesting read. Sometime in lectures, there are demonstrations. Be on the look out for those, they're pretty captivating. The assignments are fair: we have 3 quizzes (the lowest is dropped), labs, a midterm, a group presentation, and a final. Overall, I thought this class was very engaging, and really enjoyed learning about how we came to be, the implications of human activity, and our broader connection to the universe.</comment>Buy the textbook. It explains everything really well. For the final, I didn't review my notes but reread the book. I really liked this course and feel that it gives a fantastic, macro-level picture of really important trends and patterns of earth's development.</comment>Mid-semester, when he asked that someone bring a pocket knife to the front of the room to help with a demonstration, the professor made a highly offensive "joke" about how we would be "scared" if "one of our students from the 'Middle East'" had been the one to supply the knife.  He also made an inappropriate comment about women later in the course, and continually joked about saying "politically incorrect" things and offending students.  When he was confronted about these statements, he did not stop. 

Besides this offensive behavior, the class was confusing and needlessly complicated.  The "Big Picture" was totally lost in the minute details about rocks, and parts of the course that might otherwise have been interesting (we talked about the potential for aliens, for example) were made boring, stressful, and confusing.</comment>Worst academic experience at Harvard. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. First, the material - you, a non-science concentrator trying to get your SPU out of the way will be expected to know every word and every figure and photograph of the 21 chapter book (written by the professor). Quizzes don't test big ideas, but rather specific details and look out for multiple choice where 'all or none of the answers could be right' and each answer is written so carefully by the sad, sad Professor with too much time on his hands that each question is trickier than the next. Labs include wonders such as taking buckets full of dice and dumping them out over and over until everyone in the room goes deaf. Science!
Now - Charles Langmuir - the most smug, dull, insensitive human to ever 'teach'. If you can somehow swallow your vomit when he makes comments about how we should be "scared" of "students from the Middle East" you'll surely loose it when he tries to explain that comment with "I was trying to make a joke about how we should be scared of the Chinese...." and then continues throughout the semester to joke about how he just says inappropriate things sometimes lololol. Bask in the awkward silence during lecture when he asks the class a question, yet no one answers because we aren't following/have no cares left to give, but he will patiently wait upwards of a full minute until someone answers to continue his lecture. But, wait, there's more! Go to office hours for a more personal awkward experience - ask him a question and observe him stare at you with his smug grin, silent for a solid 30 seconds - did you ask a silly question? is he upset you clearly don't care about carbon isotopes? is he just a massive jerk? These are the questions of SPU.

So do yourself a favor and take any class that is not this one.</comment>Read the book!</comment>I did not enjoy this course</comment>This was honestly the worst course I ever took at Harvard, and I am a senior in the sciences. I feel a little bad for saying this, because it was evident that Dr. Langmuir cares a lot about this course and was always very available at office hours. However, there was a constant sense of panic in the class anytime a quiz/midterm came up (and not a cute "oh my god I don't know this material!" but legitimate "so um does anyone know whats going on?!"). The average score on quizzes for a gen ed should not be around a 65%.  The lab component did nothing to boost my grade and was an honest waste of time, as we somehow squandered 2 hours on 2 problems and then went home to do the other 6 that we didn't get to and had NO IDEA how to do (since they should have been explained in section). There was pretty much no point in going to lecture (even though I attended every one) because it was all explained in the book in a much clearer way.  I guess I can't really say I would have taken another SPU since the list of SPU options (yep, all 3 of them!) is pretty horrifying, but I can say that I have never actively despised a course as I did with this one.</comment>I think this class has a lot of potential to be great. The material is fascinating, but there is a LOT of it. The lectures are good, but can seem unorganized sometimes. The labs are incredibly easy, but the tests are very challenging. Take this class if you want to be inundated with a lot of interesting material and don't mind cramming for 20+ hours for the final. Actually, 20 hours really isn't enough time to cover all this material well. The textbook has 21 chapters and they all require a good deal of focus and study.</comment>Really cool material, difficult tests.</comment>This course was genuinely thought provoking, I'm very glad I took it. Professor Langmuir is great.</comment>There are better SPUs that can fulfill the requirement.</comment></course>MCB 290hfr: Current Topics in Molecular, Cellular and Organismal Biology</title>It's great when you don't have to present, and very stressful when you do have to present, but definitely worth it.</comment>This really will bring the crazyness in you! But you will feel great having done it !</comment>This is a required course.</comment></course>VES 150ar: Narrative Tactilities: Studio Course</title>Your experience in this class largely depends on the professor, but if Athina is teaching it again, I highly recommend taking it. She's a rockstar who will stop at nothing to push you and get you to produce high-quality work and develop your voice as a filmmaker.</comment>Best class I've taken</comment>This class takes up a pretty solid chunk of time. Your experience will be completely based on the instructor for the year.</comment>Fantastic class in every way. Athina is wonderful, and if you put effort in this class will make you a better filmmaker. You do need to be independently driven.</comment>Make it your main priority.</comment></course>LING 83: Language, Structure, and Cognition</title>Have no preconceptions about linguistics - I was expecting to write essays for class; instead, the P-sets are normally like puzzles. They really require some thought - not just rote learning - to complete, and are immensely satisfying to master.</comment>This class is not very time consuming or difficult (except a few topics covered in the middle of the semester). The topics are interesting and will make you think about language in a new way. Some of the methods linguists use can also be used in other fields and linguistics can be quite cross-discipinary, so there are lots of applications. Even though I don't plan to concentrate in linguistics or take any other linguistics courses, I'm glad I took this one and tried something completely new.</comment>Linguistics is an interesting but tedious field. Some of the concepts make you want to pull your hair out as you wonder, "why does this even exist?" I didn't get much from the readings, but lectures are decent and sections are quite good.</comment>It's fairly difficult.</comment>This class is more scientific than I expected. It's definitely geared toward beginners and its really interesting and fun. I came in with zero knowledge of what linguistics was but I didn't find the class to be unreasonably challenging.</comment>This class is interesting and if I could I would take it again. If you give the p-sets and readings the time they require and go to office hours when you do not fully understand certain concepts, the class will not be difficult.</comment>This class was probably the most interesting one I took all semester. I really enjoyed puzzling over the problem sets. On the down side, I thought that the class was quite easy, except for the in-class examinations (the first midterm and the final). I felt like I studied a lot for both of them, but was still stumped when I got to the test.</comment>Love Prof Polinsky's teaching style. She's truly enthusiastic about the topic and she offers a lot of insight into linguistics. She really teaches from the heart and seems extremely familiar with the materials. She's super accessible, as are the TFs, and they're all very eager to help you learn. The course is not too difficult yet you will definitely learn a lot.</comment>Take the class if you are interested in getting an overview of linguistics, knowing that some of the material may not be interesting to you. Know that to understand everything fully you will have to put in substantially more work than is required to simply get a passing grade.</comment>Can be hard if you have no prior experience and do not keep up with the readings. I was lost after the midterm. Just make sure you know the material.</comment>This class gives a good basic introduction to linguistics. The workload is extremely light, so don't worry about overloading yourself with this class. It's easy to get away with not doing readings, but the readings are interesting. The prof. and TFs are more than willing to help out.</comment>This is a great introduction course as it teaches a little piece of all the different aspects of linguistics. It is definitely a logic course with all the psets being puzzles. Although it is interesting to know linguistic facts, it certainly isn't relevant information for life or very applicable in general to anything other than linguistics. Also, while the psets are not too hard, I found the in-class midterm and final exam to be very difficult.</comment>this class is really interesting but i wouldn't necessarily recommend it to non-concentrators if you aren't seriously interested in the material - it's a cool elective but does cover a lot of brand-new material and won't be particularly applicable to other fields. the psets are actually kind of fun - like word games - and section was great. if you're interested in languages or linguistics as a field i would highly recommend this class - if you're not so interested, try something else.</comment>If you're curious about language, from wanting to know more about the world's different languages to how language is studied as a cognitive science, then you should definitely check this class out.</comment>This class was a palatable and engaging way to explore linguistics if you are at all interested in the field. The exam was harder than the midterms, but overall the class was manageable.</comment>Professor Polinsky is amazing- she is a good lecturer, has a great sense of humor, and is very approachable and friendly. She and the TFs make the course as interesting and engaging as it is, and I highly recommend it to anyone.</comment>This class will not make you an expert in Linguistics, nor do I think it is really that necessary for would-be concentrators (though I think the Ling department begs to differ). It is fun though, and you do get a broad if cursory introduction to the field. Learn enough about various areas of linguistics to sound smart in conversation. May help you decide what areas you want to investigate further (this is what I found). Great teaching staff.</comment>This class is not hard and will teach you a great deal! Prof. Pollinksy is amazing and will know the names of everyone in class (50 or so people) in under two weeks.</comment>Its a great introduction to linguistics, but also induces some really fascinating subjects like child language acquisition and creoles.</comment>This is a content heavy but very engaging class. Should take if interested in the science of languages.</comment>This course covers a wide range of topics in linguistics and is very interesting. There are a few challenging concepts but most of it is not bad. Section with Gasper was incredibly helpful though in terms of working through the difficult concepts.</comment>This course is a great introductory course of linguistics with sufficient afterclass readings and practical exercises. I would highly recommend anyone who has interest in linguistics studies to pick this couse and feel it.</comment>Professor Polinsky is a great teacher, and the material she covers is interesting and runs the gamut from highly theoretical discussions to application of those theories to real-life linguistic phenomena.</comment>If you're interested in Linguistics, I think you'll get a fair amount out of this course. It covers a wide range of topics (addressing the main sub-fields of Linguistics) but doesn't go into very much depth with any one of them.</comment>Be careful; you may know everything from lecture, but if you haven't studied all the readings a few times, the final exam will be extremely difficult.</comment>It's a great opportunity to get your feet wet in a study rarely offered in high school.</comment></course>EXPOS 20.253: Wizards and Wild Things</title>Take this course because it is easy and interesting. I enjoyed class discussions without feeling stressed about getting work for that class done.</comment>I LOVED this class and recommend it to anyone and everyone. Professor Barber helped me improve my writing immeasurably and led incredibly interesting yet relaxed discussions from rhetoric to child psychology. Readings are not only manageable but enjoyable, and there is a lot of freedom in choosing topics for papers. TAKE THIS COURSE! It's everything expos should be.</comment>LOVED IT! Take this class if you love literature, fairytales, etc. It is not too hard but very fulfilling.</comment>This is the best expos offered if you have an interest in children's literature and are willing to participate in classroom conversations. There is not a lot of reading but that does not mean that the class is easy, you have to do the same amount of work (drafts, response papers etc.) as any other expos. The professor is engaging, enthusiastic about the topic and really helpful throughout the writing process (his comments are amazing).</comment>I can say quite confidently that this is one of it not the best Expos course offered. Prof. Barber is gentle, thoughtful, intelligent and the syllabus is incredible. He gives such detailed, thorough feedback on all of the assignments that you can't help but become a greater writer with him. And best of all, the class is very flexible.</comment>Take this expos class! I loved it and after hearing horror stories from my friends about their expos classes felt positive this is THE BEST EXPOS CLASS! Professor Barber is a wonderful man and goes and beyond after every draft and essay to give us reflective and thought out feedback. He dedicates himself so fully to the class and makes everyone want to do their best. The readings are pretty cool too.  I definitely feel that I have improved as a writer after taking this course.</comment>This course, Wizards and Wild Things, lets you read books like Tom Sawyer and Lord of the Flies and write about it. This appealed to me because I would be reading and writing about literature I enjoyed and am passionate about. If you are passionate about children's literature and the messages it contains I would strongly recommend applying for this course.</comment>My preceptor, David Barber, is the reason why my expos experience was so positive this semester. His feedback is unbelievably thorough and he is always willing to help out in any situation and it is obvious how much time he puts into the class. While sections themselves can sometimes become a little boring, the essays were very engaging and I always looked forward to Barber's comments and feedback as I felt my writing improved tremendously throughout the whole term.</comment>An engaging and fun expos class</comment>This is a really great expos class. The readings are enjoyable because they're either excerpts from classic children's books or critiques of children's books. Professor Barber gives amazing feedback and great constructive criticism. His conferences are really helpful as well. Definitely take this class.</comment>Super fun class with very manageable and interesting readings</comment></course>SOCIOL 296a: Proseminar on Inequality & Social Policy I</title>Great intro to inequality policy in America</comment></course>PHIL 276x: Bioethics: Seminar</title>Kamm is an excellent teacher, and it's a real privilege to study with her.</comment>This is an excellent course covering a variety of topics in bioethical theory. Prof Kamm pushes students to think critically. Discussion is lively.</comment>Exceptional, in depth examination of topics in bioethics. A joy and credit to take.</comment></course>E&M-REASON 14: Fat Chance</title>This is a great class to fulfill your GenEd requirement! However, I almost regret taking this course because I took CS50 which already fulfilled that requirement. I would not take this class as an elective. The professors are AMAZING. Best of the best. But that alone should not be the reason you take this course- take it for GenEd credit, but nothing else.</comment>Balanced, well-taught class for those seeking a basic understanding of probability. Material is deceptively complex, though; this isn't the joke class that the name suggests. Take homework seriously, as it's 40% of the grade. Otherwise, tests are straightforward, help is plentiful, and the environment is pretty fun (professors blast rock music at the start of every class).</comment>This course is a straightforward easy math class. It will help you have an open mind about statistics and probability.</comment>Take this course as a relatively painless gen ed, but don't be shocked if some of the assignments sneak up on you</comment>Amazing lectures. Fantastic professors. Really clear expectations and well-structured. You'll also learn useful things if you don't know probability and stats and review useful thing if it's already familiar to you.</comment>easy and fun class. I wish more material was covered. Great teaching staff which creates enthusiasm for the content and which is open to talk at any time.</comment>This class was very easy and straightforward. You will learn how to make better decisions after this course because probability is covered in-depth.</comment>Take this course, especially if math isn't your thing. It's taught by amazing professors, and Eric is really wonderful. Workload is very light, and exams are really fair. Great way to get rid of EM requirement painlessly, while still gaining something.</comment>One of the best taught classes I have taken at Harvard. Dick Gross and Joe Harris are both the kinds of professors that you will be telling your kids about one day. They are enthusiastic and brilliant.  They know some of the best strategies for explaining concepts.  My favorite part of class was just watching them teach, it was beautiful.  Fun, easy, rewarding class - a must take.</comment>If you are looking for a fairly simple math course in which the professors and TF are really willing to help you out, this is it. Sure, there are lectures 3 times a week, but sections are optional and honestly, Harris and Gross are so happy they will, through osmosis, make you happy too. Even if you don't like math.</comment>This is an awesome class for "history" majors who need to fill out their E&M requirement.  Also, the professors are great.  The TF especially is super helpful, and willing to devote any time to clearing any confusion.  Eric Reidl was eager to always answers questions of confusion via e-mail, and did so with a smile.  I learned A LOT of USEFUL probability.</comment>If you pay attention and don't leave the homework to the last minute, this course is completely manageable.</comment>This class is the best at Harvard. It is the best taught class here as well.</comment>This is a great class. I never fully understood probability from high school and this class has amazing professors and TF who really help you understand the material. You end up being able to apply concepts you learn in class in a variety of questions from poker to elections.</comment>EMR 14 is an unbelievable Gen. Ed/elective.  The teachers are amazing and truly want everyone in the class to succeed. It's not overwhelmingly difficult - in fact, the problem sets are very, very manageable and teach you a lot about the material (plus there is only 1 a week, 10 total).  Definitely take this class if you need an EMR credit or need an elective to fill a class spot - you will NOT regret it!!</comment>Great, interesting and humorous lectures; the concepts were always fleshed-out and backed up with lots of examples and problems. I'd really, really encourage you to go to every lecture you can just because they make learning the material so much more easy and fun. The workload is relatively light and strikes a good balance between fun and challenge. The best part of the class, however, is by far the atmosphere: Dick and Joe are both fantastic lecturers and people, and Eric (our TF) always commits to helping students in any capacity he can. The class is also very small and I made a lot of my closest Harvard friends here :) Bottom line: if you enjoy math but don't enjoy tearing your hair out over it, this class is made for you!</comment>The class is extremely difficult and unless all you want to learn how to do is count how many ways to roll three 6's on 4 dice then I would stay away from the class.</comment>Somebody who excels in the field of mathematics may find the material somewhat easy, though there are still things to be taken away from this class.</comment>gives you a nice understanding of basic probability</comment>One of best classes at Harvard. Absolute gem.</comment>The professors have a lot of personality; the lectures are engaging; and the work load and exams are nothing to stress about.</comment>Hard</comment>Absolutely great course full of amazing professors and an amazing TF. Easy math gen ed that can balance out an extremely difficult course load.</comment>Take it! It was an enjoyable course with a light workload.</comment>Very easy Gen-Ed and also very enjoyable. Felt like youre learning things you could use later.</comment>This is a great class if you would like a good grasp of the basic concepts of probability and counting problems. If you never understood them in high school, Fat Chance is the class where you can fully understand. If you attend lecture and take notes (can be substituted by referencing the coursebook if you don't like taking notes), you'll ace the homework and exams. Office hours are extremely helpful.</comment></course>SOCIOL 132: Food, Culture, and Globalization</title>Very interesting course with very manageable work load! Prof Moon is very kind and knowledgable and willing to work with you.</comment>I wish this class with Prof. Moon was being offered again because I've told a lot of my friends about it and they all want to take it. It was my favorite class this semester, by far.</comment>Lots of reading that is not necessary as everything is covered in class.</comment></course>SOC-STD 98oa: Human Rights in Africa</title>This course is awesome. If you've never taken a course on human rights before, this is a really good start because it's so interdisciplinary: philosophy (critiquing our conception of human rights), politics (in practice how do we think/act about human rights?), history (learned so much about many African countries), economics. It's really a solid course. the level of discussion was very high, due both to my peers and the professor's flawless facilitation of the class. Also, great that there are no costs associated with this class--no books to buy is definitely a burden lifted!</comment>This tutorial is fantastic. If you have any interest in Africa or Human Rights, I highly recommend it. Plus, it also proved to be a mini-methods course as well. Professor McClendon puts a huge emphasis on method, which was really helpful. I highly recommend this course.</comment>Definitely take this course! Prof. McClendon is an amazing professor who is so dedicated to having students learn about research and about the topic of the tutorial. She provides excellent feedback on assignments, and after taking this class I feel very prepared to begin writing my thesis.</comment>Great course on African Human rights as well as generally enlightening on the worldwide human rights agenda and rhetoric. McClendon is wonderful and she just makes the course quite interesting. You'll get email reminders with the basis questions of discussion for the week which is very helpful as you do your readings. Start the readings early though. They are pretty good and perusing might not be as easy as you expect, there is so much interesting detail.</comment>This is a great tutorial. Professor McClendon is incredibly invested in it; she has crafted an engaging syllabus that emphasizes both content and teaching of research methods, and spends a lot of time helping each of us navigate research for our final paper. Her comments are very helpful!</comment></course>ANTHRO 1606: Being Asian American: Representations and Realities</title>I thought this was a great reflective class that allowed students to think about their own experiences. At the same time, I feel like there was too much information being squeezed into one semester. Some of the assignments seemed repetitive, but overall Prof. Yano and Zoe were very encouraging and enthusiastic about the course material.</comment>If this topic is one that interests you, the course does a good job of exploring a variety of angles. Very interesting topics and discussions, and the field trip and Alumni summit were informative and enjoyable as well. The opportunity to hear from other students in the class and to actually get to know classmates and their experiences in such a setting was I think the main highlight of the course - I knew everyone in the class by mid-semester, which is more than I can say for most of the classes I have taken here. Some of the lecture material and reading material was not as helpful as it could have been or as relevant to class discussions and broader themes as needed, though, and the course could benefit from having more direction and streamlining. There are 5 papers and they can get a bit repetitive, but other than that the workload was okay. Overall, would recommend - I definitely came away with a much broader and deeper understanding of the Asian American experience.</comment>The class is not very hard and the topics cover really niche areas of Asian American history--basically whatever topics the professor had written a book in, which was ethnic beauty pageants, food, and Hell Kitty. I wish we had talked more about the issues that affect us because I think most of us didn't really care about ethnic beauty pageants. Anthropology writing is also not rigorous at all, which bothers me.</comment>Great professor, great TF, incredible course that changed my life.</comment>You absolutely must take this class. It will change the way you think about being Asian-American, or if you don't identify as Asian-American, you will understand an entire set of experiences that your friends and peers go through that you had no idea about before. The readings are really interesting and the workload is not at all overwhelming. This was my favorite class so far at Harvard and I really hope other students have the chance to study this as well.</comment>Great class! It really makes you think introspectively about your experiences and that of your fellow peers: a joy to take!</comment>Great forum to discuss topics on Asian American issues with other students in a structured way</comment>this class is so fluffy. professor yano is nice, but specializes in topics that have little to no bearing on real life. ie, we spend a ridiculous amount of time in class on things like ethnic beauty pageants (???) and hello kitty, but little to none on mental health issues, sexuality/gender issues, issues that impact your everyday life as an asian american trying to understand their own identity... if you're looking to think about/understand asia america more critically, DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. you'd be better off taking asian american lit or something like that. everything also feels very high school (ie, watch this movie and turn in a reading guide where let's hope you took down a few random notes) and it's not challenging or substantive. not for lack of trying, but this class was really not good. don't feel like i got anything out of it that i couldn't have gotten by reading the books/watching the movies outside of class, and i don't think that i would even spend my time on some of those. the professor tries, but it feels like she's not totally sure what she wants us to get out of all of the random things she does.</comment>Take this class! The pros totally outweigh cons. The class is not perfect because this was the first time the class was given at Harvard and because it was Professor Yano's first semester at Harvard. With a little tweaks, this would be the perfect and one of the most interesting classes at Harvard! 

Pros: The work load is minimal. It's just a few books, but make sure you actually read them and don't cram. Compared to most Harvard classes, the work load is reduced by 80%. (It's a essay every 2-3 weeks and a book every 2-3 weeks. Totally doable!) Professor Yano will give you benchmarks to help you with writing essays and the TF is totally willing to help - just ask. Don't be afraid to ask questions to Professor Yano and Zoe. Just because the work load is easy doesn't mean that you don't learn anything. You are continuously exposed to a lot of films and Asian American figures. It's not one of those class where the material gets old, because it's the same material repeatedly. Instead, Prof Yano covers different ethnicities, adoption, past discrimination with women, current discrimination with the model minority stereotype outside of academics and so on. You will learn and be more curious to learn more. 

Cons of this class: the transcription took FOREVER! The essay topics are very open ended, so people can study/write about whatever! If you are not used to open essays, it can be daunting. Some of the speakers are off topic (but all the films were all on point! Kenny Endo as a speaker -- AWESOME. BEST ASIAN AMERICAN EXAMPLE EVER.) Sometimes the lecture material goes over your head. Most of the time you just wish you had more time to go over the material and had more discussions, especially on the books since they seem like isolated material. 

But like I said, the pros outweigh the cons. And I would highly recommend the class!</comment>The subject material is interesting. Zoe, the TF, is pretty great if you take the time to get to know her. Professor Yano also has the best intentions but Zoe is better at connecting with the students. It's a pretty chill class (there's no section, so you just need to be prepared for in class discussion), but there's not a lot of the direction from Yano for papers.</comment>Though I don't believe it will be offered next year because Yano is a visiting professor, I would say -- build on the relationships you make in the course and have more discussions outside the course.</comment>Get ready for a lot of writing that is very inter-related, but to talk about subjects that can be personal in the best way</comment>I really loved both Professor Yano and Zoe! They are some of the most caring and engaging people who really care about students. This has been one of my favorite classes at Harvard so far, because it really allowed me to think about my identity in a deep way. Beyond that, the class size was awesome and we became a lot closer as a class through the topics and discussions. Take this class!!! It is so worth it! It really made me feel like I had valid things to say, and gave me confidence in other classes as well!</comment>This class was fascinating; between current events on campus and the historical overview provided by the course itself, I felt far more informed of the present state of Asian American identity in the United States and elsewhere after completing this course than I was before enrolling. The readings were intriguing, as were our in-class discussions, and I would highly recommend the course to any with an interest in the factors that shape modern Asian American experiences of race, ethnicity and identity.</comment>Zoe and the people in the class made it. If Zoe is TF-ing or even teaching the class again, you should take it. It was also just a great forum to hear other people's opinions on a subject that I personally cared quite a bit about. If you don't care, though, this class is very difficult to drag through. Even with caring, though, it still felt like it dragged a little.</comment></course>FRSEMR 25p: Neurotoxicology: Biological Effects of Environmental Poisons</title>This class is definitely very low-key and easy. There are "pop" quizzes every couple of weeks, but once you figure out what types of questions he asks on them, you will know exactly what you need to know to ace them. Dr. Counter is an amazing person, but he's also a name dropper and never hesitates to include a little tidbit about dinner with Will Smith or Malala Yousafzai. The course gets much better once you start learning about lead and mercury, which take up the back half of the course. He's much more passionate about those toxins and has done a lot of work in the Andes treating lead-poisoned children. He's a very kind person, bringing cookies to every class and inviting us to his home. If you're interested in biochem or neuro, you will probably like this seminar.</comment>This class is an absolute blast, Dr. Counter is an incredible teacher and the subject matter is extremely interesting.</comment>Professor Counter has led a very interesting life and you will hear several interesting stories. He is very kind and brings cookies to class every week. He is particularly passionate about lead poisoning so that unit was particularly interesting. If you take this course, do not assume that you do not need to write the ten page paper that is mentioned in the syllabus but never in class. In the last two minutes of our final class he assigned us the 10 page paper. Other than that, the workload was really easy.</comment>This is one of the more difficult seminars, but it is worth it! You learn a lot from it. I would definitely recommend it, but be prepared to have more tests and readings than your peers (still worth it!).</comment>Be ready for the pop quiz</comment>The teacher is probably the coolest person you will ever meet.</comment>Dr. Counter is a great person to know and really cares about his students. He also enlightens the class about some of the atrocities that still happen in the world that involve lead and mercury</comment>A great class (if interested in the subject matter) with probably the most interesting professor on campus!</comment>A great seminar, easy workload, and an interesting professor. Take it if you want to learn more about neuroscience.</comment>It's a great class. Sometimes the papers that he gives may go over your head (not because of the content so much as what these papers look like) and the sheer amount, but this was a nice class to take as a seminar.</comment>Dr. Counter is one of the most charismatic people anyone can meet. This class was highly enjoyable because of the classroom setting where we were open to talk about all the neurotoxins.</comment></course>EXPOS 20.097: HIV/AIDS in Culture</title>Joaquin is amazing, the reading list is amazing, everything is awesome.</comment>I would take this course again and again! It definitely helped to broaden my understanding of the world as it really is.</comment>Joaquin genuinely cares about his students. He is not only a great preceptor, but also a great mentor and role model.</comment>Joaquin is an incredible preceptor and he made the class very enjoyable. I learned not only about HIV/AIDS in culture but I feel that I have improved myself as a citizen and human being, too. As long as you keep up with readings and due dates, you will be fine. My biggest recommendation is GO TO OFFICE HOURS! That is the best thing you can do to get your paper exactly where you and Joaquin want it.</comment>Professor Terrones is a great preceptor! He provides excellent advice during draft conferences and is always willing to help out his students when they have questions! The topic of the course is interesting and immediately relevant and I think everyone who takes this class will come out with a more educated view of HIV/AIDS in culture.</comment>This course completely transformed the way I thought! I came in thinking I only liked math and sciences, but after taking HIV/AIDS In Culture, it opened my eyes to realities of the world and to fight for what you believe in.</comment>The information and readings are fairly interesting! Just be warned you will not get prompt feedback on your essays or very detailed suggestions for improvement.</comment>To say this class changed my life forever is not an exaggeration. I cannot imagine a more important class. You will learn so much more than just how to write well. My eyes were opened to how there is so much more to saving lives than science. This class will make you a better person. Not taking would absolutely be something to regret.</comment>Joaquin takes a unique approach to the generally mundane expos requirements. He truly engages you and makes you interested in the topic. This course could easily be an analysis of the biochemistry behind the drug work, but instead it becomes a discussion on the sociological context through which HIV/AIDS was found. You get an understanding for both social activism, and the way AIDS affected gay life in America. Though you do discuss the mechanics of writing, the in class discussions go beyond that and Joaquin refuses to linger on tedious information that you could easily just get from a hand-out. Instead, the class is structured so that you build on the topic while also learning to write - something his feedback and his draft conferences will really help you do.</comment>This is an incredible course. Totally transformational experience. Changed the way I think, the way I write, and the way I approach social issues. The feedback you'll get from Joaquin is amazing. Make sure to put effort into your drafts and response papers to get the most out of this feedback. Don't be afraid to engage with class discussions.</comment>I highly recommend this class! The subject material is intriguing and diverse (readings, films, etc.). You also learn a lot about writing well in this course that will be useful across all academic disciplines.</comment>This class is likely one of the best of the expos program. Joaquin, the preceptor, is wonderful; he's a strongly passionate, kind, and intelligent individual. The required readings are reasonable as well (and you can pretty much just skim some of the accessory materials). Joaquin is no easy grader, but hey, very few expos preceptors are. If you want an expos course that will leave you satisfied, inspired, and a better writer, then take this class.</comment></course>SOC-STD 10a: Introduction to Social Studies</title>This class will absolutely change your life. You will develop ideas about issues that you didn't even realized existed such as sovereign and morality.</comment>This course is a requirement for Social Studies so there's no avoiding it, but it's great to get an exposure to all these key writers and thinkers of history. I had reservations going in because I knew that I didn't want to necessarily study social theory and philosophy as a Social Studies concentrator, but I still found it useful to read all these writers, and found some of my most thoughtful and intellectually stimulating discussions at Harvard in the tutorials for this class. The readings can be tough at times, and take a really long time to get through each week- I can safely say every free time I had I was reading the material for this class- but if you learn to skip over some things and just get the main ideas of each writer, it'll be less of a challenge and time-consumer.</comment>This class will teach you to analyze theories of justice, of liberty, of government, and of social interaction. The ideas I learned through this course keep coming back to me, and they are no doubt useful to better understand world events.</comment>It is one of the most fulfilling classes I have ever taken. It can be very hard, but it's one of the few classes that I have taken that actually really caused me to think and taught me more about how to be a thinker.</comment>Hella readIng</comment>Do not spend the time doing all the readings that in depth if you don't have to...pick the ones you find most interesting and focus in on them.  Some units drag and others are much more interesting, so just be sure to really engage with the material you find interesting.  Participate in section; lectures are not mandatory but are quite helpful despite not being the most interesting.</comment>This is not a course you just take for fun. Take it if you are very serious about philosophy or are strongly considering social studies. The work is worthwhile if you have an interest in the subject, but it has to be the main focus of your courseload.</comment>Although the reading can be a bit heavy at times, it is well worth it.</comment>Doing the readings and going to lecture really do help you glean more from this class. If you put the work in to really understand each thinker every week, then you will benefit not only by getting a better grade in the class but by feeling confidence to discuss and apply these thinkers in your other classes / in everyday life.</comment>Even if you're not a Social Studies Concentrator, this class is pretty great -- Tuck and Frazer do a good job of stimulating discussion about the various authors, and overall the class operates as a good canon of great Western thinkers. If you wanted to read authors like Kant, Smith, Marx, etc and haven't done so yet, this is a pretty good introduction to their work.</comment>Obviously you have to take it to concentrate in social studies. For non-Social Studies concentrators, I'd say it's definitely a worthwhile academic experience, but only take it if you have the time and desire to really devote attention to it.</comment>This course is incredible. It will change the way you think, write, and interact with the world. Take it with the full intention of doing the readings well and engaging fully in lecture and section, otherwise you won't get everything you can out of it.</comment>This is an incredible course. The tutorials are the main component, lecture is much less important. The majority of the weight of the class is on the writing assignments, the rest is on class participation (mostly) in the tutorial. I learned more than I could imagine this semester, and gained a foundational understanding on how to argue about theory and write about theory. The lecture is lackluster, the first hour is basically a reading of wikipedia with a little bit of contextualization of the author within the greater construct of history of philosophy. Definitely attend all tutorials, and as many lectures as you feel necessary.</comment>This class is not easy. But it is not impossible. For myself, the papers were unlike anything I had ever written before and took A TON of preparation, reading, thought, and analysis. I found lecture to be mildly interesting but somewhat useless. This class pushes you as an intellectual and the papers give you a chance to really get in depth with some of the most important authors you could read in this world. Sometimes found myself leaving tutorial utterly mindblown, which I found exciting and interesting. Overall, a manageable class that is 100% worth it.</comment>This is class that in retrospect you will really appreciate. During the course though there will be times that you may feel extremely confused or challenged. The best way to handle the course is to do the readings in advance and then talk with professors and your tutorial leader. Everyone is willing to help if you reach out!</comment>Although staying on top of the readings can be very challenging, the books are must-reads for students that are interested in gaining a better understanding of how intellectual thought has influenced the development of western institutions. I would encourage all students to take it.</comment>Be ready to read a ton of theory, tackle challenging essay topics, and listen in tutorial so that you can learn as much from your peers and their questions/insights as you would learn from your tutor. Be open and willing to be challenged––if you do not take this mentality from the get-go, your experience in SS10a will be subpar.</comment>absolutely necessary and powerful class- learn to think of life and the systems of the world in a more informed, grounded manner. It is like listening to music after gaining extensive music theory knowledge- everything can be interoperated in a foundational manner. also presents many new ways of looking at life, each with its own merits and faults</comment>This class involves reading authors from Hobbes to Marx, and if you're concentrating in Social Studies, you have to take it. Lectures can be pretty boring but the really great part about this class is the tutorial component. If you can soldier through the lecture of the week and make it to tutorial, it's very worth it! Tutorials are no more than 8 students and they're a great place to have really engaging and fun discussions about the authors. They're the highlight of Social Studies 10. And in the end, you'll feel incredibly proud of yourself for having read all these authors and having engaged with them so thoroughly.</comment>This class is very good opportunity to get acquainted with the classical social and political thinkers. It is useful for gaining an understanding of the heritage of our political, social and economic systems.</comment>If you are considering concentrating in Social Studies as I was, this is a must take class, and I enjoyed reading these works immensely. But if you are not interested in Social Studies, or in thinking about society, history, and politics with an eye towards theorizing, this is probably not for you at all.</comment>This is a challenging and time consuming course, but it's also incredibly rewarding. The readings are fantastic, and if you put in the time you will get so much out of them. Everyone in tutorial really wants to be there, so the discussions are excellent, thought provoking, and sometimes make your head hurt. Don't take this course if you're not willing to put in significant time and effort, but definitely take it if you want to become a better writer, thinker, and student.</comment>If you're interested in social theory, ethics, or simply want to be able to quote important names, this class is probably the best at Harvard. A challenging and rather theoretical course, but extremely informative and very well taught.</comment>Very much worth the time and effort required to succeed in this class</comment>This class is a great introduction to different political theorists. It is a lot of reading, but it was enjoyable to engage in all the ideas explored in the class.</comment>Necessary evil for the social studies student. Luckily there are only three papers assigned, which isn't a ton of work, but it's tough. Get ready to read.</comment>You really do need to have an interest in the social sciences and be willing to dedicate much time to reading</comment>If you are into social theory or wish to grasp a solid understanding of the fundamental social and political theories that have shaped philosophical thought for generations to come, this is the class for you.</comment>lots of reading</comment>This class is incredible. If you graduate college and you haven't read Marx, jokes on you--you actually didn't graduate.</comment>If you work hard, you will get a lot out. That doesn't mean you have to read everything. You just have to focus on key components of the reading to demonstrate to yourself and your peers a deep understanding of core concepts.</comment>I went into this class thinking I was just taking it as a painful concentration requirement.  Left feeling like it was one of my favorite classes at Harvard thus far.</comment>Great course in learning about western theory.</comment>Definitely take this class if you are interested in exploring the concentration. It is a lot of work as the materials are dense and some tutors intense, but I have found it to be very worth it. If you live in Adams House and get David, then don't be afraid of him. He is very into philosophy and will use advanced terms (just note them and look them up later).</comment>Your tutor is your experience.</comment>This is an exceptional course. It is hard—but the return is enormous. Demonstrably enhances your ability to read, write, and think.</comment>This class is outstanding. I am leaving one semester with a clear picture of a wide range of authors and a good understanding of the social theory discussion in the western tradition. The readings are outstanding, and the small tutorials are great (if you come prepared, that is).</comment>One of the more though-provoking classes you'll find at Harvard</comment>It is a great course, but you will only like it if you do the readings. Lectures are only helpful the first hour. Sections are only good if you know what you are talking about! Read, Read, Read!</comment>Take this class if you're at all considering Social Studies. Take this class if you're not considering Social Studies but want a strong grounding in social theory that you might not get elsewhere. I'm not going on in Social Studies, but I'm already using what I've learned in 10a for other social sciences.</comment>This is the perfect theory course, and one of the best classes - if not the best - class I've taken at Harvard. We read a string of brilliant and insightful authors whose views have shaped our world. Tuck, Frazer, and the rest of the teaching staff teach the material brilliantly, and tutorial generates great new insights. The readings are demanding and take a lot of time to read well, but if you put the time in, you will have an insightful and enjoyable experience and come out with a great understanding of some of the best and most interesting ideas anyone in recorded history has ever had.</comment>A good chance to read the great texts. It gives you enough room to explore your own interests and develop your own insights. Take advantage of it!</comment>While lecture can seem irrelevant, having the chance to engage with these works, especially those toward the latter end of the class is amazing. Your tutor will make or break the experience.</comment>This is a fantastic class and tutorial specifically offers you the incredible opportunity to work though this great material with a small group.</comment>This class is definitely no walk in the park. There is seemingly endless reading to do every week and it can be hard to get through some of the authors (especially Kant and Hegel) because of their writing style and structure. Though if you put in the effort to understand the readings and pay attention in lecture (which can be boring), your mind will be opened to new ideas and analyses of the way the world came to become what it is today. Sections and papers are intellectually stimulating and, if you're lucky, will allow you to connect the readings to current events to make the theories even more realistic. I have grown so much as a student and become a budding intellectual thanks to 10a and look forward to continuing the journey into 10b.</comment>The readings are pretty intimidating, but if you find an efficient way of absorbing the material, you'll be ok. Tutorial quality seems to vary. My tutor was great, but I have heard of students who had problems with their tutor.</comment>It is an amazing introduction to social theory. I feel like this is the kind of experience I expected to have at a liberal arts school over 4 years condensed into 1 year. Tutorial is really the gem of this course, but it can also be subjective based on your leader. The first semester can get rough because some of the authors are really dense, but you'll be able to think a lot more deeply about everything because of it.</comment>This course is very interesting and thought provoking. People will tell you it's a lot of work because of all the readings; this is true. Do them, you'll learn a lot!</comment>In no other class will you cover this much material in such short time. I would definitely not have read Kant, Hegel, Smith on my own. This class provided me with the support structure I needed to critically engage with the readings. A precaution: it's a lot of reading. You are reading 200-300 pages a week and if it's on the shorter side, it's probably denser material. You have to put in the effort for this class, as in do all the readings so you can fully participate in section. Also, lecture can get a tad bit hard to sit through, but an upperclassman gave me a piece of advice that I thought was particularly helpful. Drink a cup of coffee before class and just soak in Frazer/Tuck's geniuses.</comment>As cliche as it is, this class has changed the way I think. It's a lot of work, but you will leave as a more rational, educated person. One of the best intellectual experiences I've had at Harvard.</comment>This course provides a baptism by fire to some of the major texts that have influenced the social sciences and social thought. The workload is heavy, and wading through the passages to find the key points can be difficult. Lectures and tutorials are generally unrelated. Lectures can provide a helpful introduction or overview to the readings, but vary in clarity and sometimes are difficult to follow. Tutorials can be very interesting discussions and helpful at clarifying the readings, but also cover very dense philosophical ideas (which is not everyone's cup of tea).</comment>Only take this course if you like theory or plan to concentrate in Social Studies. And if you're enrolled in the class and after a couple of weeks still don't like theory, don't think that you will. Just be completely honest with yourself. There is sooooo much reading. The only good part is the section leaders because they really do love what they teach and are super accessible to students.</comment>Ughhhhhhhhhhhhh</comment>Do not be fooled by Q-scores and peers, this course is amazing!  It may seem like a lot of reading, but done properly, it is possible to get through everything.  This course will open your mind to the wonderland of political philosophy, and will change the way you look at politics and the world.  Highly recommend!</comment>This course is a course that challenged me and pushed me academically unlike any other class before, but was completely worth it! I am so honored to say that I know have read (and understand a little bit of) some of the great theorists of all time! The tutorial system is great and I loved getting to know my housemates who were also grappling with these questions!</comment>Social Studies 10a is a fantastic class. It is well-taught, based on interesting material, well-structured, and both challenging and doable. The professors are both fantastic and the tutors are passionate and committed to the class.</comment>Overall a great course, the best overview of renaissance/modern philosophy available at Harvard. Don't bother doing all the reading. Get the author's main idea, then move on.</comment>So much reading. You don't necessarily have to read every single page, but you do have to have a solid grasp on all the concepts covered (which is hard, especially given the stylistic choices of the authors we read), or you'll look foolish in tutorial and on your papers.</comment>It's mandatory for Social Studies concentrators</comment>100% take it, even if you don't really want to be social studies (I'm not). I think it's just material that everyone should know if they want to understand the world and be wholly educated.</comment>The strength of this course is its syllabus. It is very difficult to take social studies 10a and not learn the major ideas of a number of key European social theorists whose ideas have influenced the development of contemporary social thought.</comment>I would recommend taking this to any sophomore with an inkling of interest in Social Studies; if you end up concentrating in Social Studies, it's a requirement/litmus test, and even if you don't, you will become a better writer and thinker. The two hour lectures were often tedious (I felt Tuck often focused on history to the detriment of talking about ideas, and also introduced advanced concepts without really explaining how he got there), but the tutorial component is amazing if you have a good tutor. The small, discussion-based tutorial with other dedicated students was one of my best college experiences yet. The reading load is heavy, but the books are things you feel like you should read in college anyway. So take the course.</comment>If you give this course a chance and delve deeply into the texts, you could enrich your perspective on life in ways that no other course might be able to do. In no other framework will you have a lecture, an intimate discussion session and paper-writing that is specifically tailored to helping you glean the most out of the very complex pieces you'll read. I think this course should be mandatory for all Harvard students.</comment>The course features a lot of interesting authors but it includes a large amount of reading.</comment>You have probably heard it's a tough class, but it is quite manageable. The readings are long and confusing, but after section, you'll have a clearer idea of the main topics. I did not know the difference between social studies and sociology before shopping period. After attending info-sessions, I thought I was going to concentrate in sociology before I shopped both and now I have decided on social studies. So give the class a try! This has been the best class I have taken so far.</comment>Social Studies 10A will be in part exactly what you expect it to be (long readings, insightful, you feel like a true-liberal arts student) but it will also be unexpectful in many ways (for me, this realization came in the form of the incredible conversations I had with my class and with my tutorial professor outside of class) Take it, you may regret it in the short run, but you will also love it. And the readings are doable, dont let people scare you!</comment>If you are considering concentrating in social studies, definitely take this class. It is a ton of reading but it is very rewarding as you read some of the most important works of political and social theory ever written, so the things you learn will serve you well even in other humanities subjects.</comment>Tutorials vary a lot, which can really affect your experience of this class. The readings are difficult, involved, and long, but if you put real effort into them, it's incredibly rewarding to see your understanding grow. It's a great survey class, even for people not concentrating in social studies. Lectures are also long, bring some coffee, but most of them are relatively interesting.</comment>Discussions within tutorial can be immensely frustrating but also enlightening. The lectures and readings pose very provocative questions about the role of the individual within society, the role of government and religion, and the systems of dependence and exploitation among different classes. Towards the end we began to apply the theory to modern issues such as consumerism and income inequality. Perhaps will allow you to recognize and take ownership of your responsibility to those around you.</comment></course>SOC-WORLD 51: Politics of Nature</title>weekly class was lecture (which was great, professor was amazing lecturer) and then "discussion" which was usually just the same few people talking. lecture and section were the best parts. there is a weekly discussion posting on the sites, but other than that the essays and posts were pretty good.</comment>A nice course to learn about the politics of nature.</comment>The readings get increasingly repetitive and the lectures are extremely long but overall the class is not difficult.</comment>This class is really cool! If you are interested at all in environmentalism, nature, environmental justice, or climate change this is a cool class to take. There are a lot of people from different backgrounds (science, social science, outdoorsy people etc) which makes for a cool atmosphere in the class. The readings are sometimes a lot, but they are incredibly interesting. The papers are also not bad and very manageable! Finally, the teaching staff is so engaged and committed and really knows their stuff! Take this class if you want to think critically and learn a lot.</comment>Only take this is you are interested in the environment, otherwise you will not be invested whatsoever.</comment>Such a fantastic class! It changed the way I saw the world. It's actually a pretty high-level course; the material is deep and challenging. It feels more like an upper division anthro course than a GenEd. Professor Subramanian is brilliant and engaging. Although the material is relatively difficult for a GenEd, it is not a huge time sink: this course has a very high learning/effort ratio.</comment>Fantastic course. Brings ideas and ways of thinking from various disciplines together. You will never look at "Nature" and nature in society the same way again. Excellent lecture too.</comment>The lectures were usually just summaries of the readings and the Q&A sessions in the second hour of every class were downright painful, since so few people talked. I thought the essay prompts were a little dull, but many of the reading were very interesting and changed my perspective about humans and nature.</comment>I was really excited about this course, since I am interested in environmental conservation. However, I felt that there was not enough variety of course readings. Many readings were quite theoretical, and a large part of the course was focused on issues of indigenous rights, environmental toxicity, and human rights. These are all important issues, and it's understandable that the professor (an anthropologist) would take this stance. However, from the title of the course, I was hoping that we would talk more about nature/wildlife conservation and how scientists might play a role in environmental politics. Also, lectures mostly summarized the readings, and I feel like we could have covered many more topics and case studies if the structure of lectures was changed.</comment>I would strongly recommend this to anyone doing environmental history-related work!</comment>You need this class. You need it.</comment>While this course asks you to reconsider the ethics and political life of nature, environmental justice and wilderness, I felt as if it was a bit of a missed opportunity. As currently structured, the lectures are too long, with a in-lecture discussion component often feeling awkward and not constructive. The readings were manageable and enjoyable, as were the essays. A painless Societies of the World Gen Ed for those interested in environmental ethics or anthropology.</comment>This is fantastic class, eye-opening, engaging, sometimes the subject is rather heavy but reality is rather heavy, you'll learn about so many important debates and struggles and see how they fit together, in a combined lecture/seminar environment that is unconventional perhaps but really leads to the sort of informed reflection and discussion that every class should aim for.</comment>excellent primer in political ecology</comment>The material is very accessible. Work is not difficult, and includes 3 essays and a weekly blog post. Do the reading!</comment>This is a class full of information that EVERYONE should be talking about, so it is for that reason that I recommend it, but I think it had its flaws. Still, if you are in any way interested in the environment, policy, wildlife, national parks, and environmental justice, this class will work for you.</comment>Lectures can sometimes be dry, and some of the readings aren't as interesting if you aren't an anthropology concentrator; but looking back, the course was absolutely amazing.  It will fundamentally redefine what you consider 'nature' to be, and how we should go about trying to protect our environment.  The readings might be a little less interesting if you aren't a huge anthropology buff, but the course overall is fantastic</comment>If you really like trees, go for it.  I mentioned (what I thought was a valid point about walking vs. riding in a golf cart when playing golf, and i was stigmatized against the rest of the class.</comment>This is the best class at Harvard regarding the social and political issues surrounding environmentalism. It also gives a very solid background in the main debates, present and past, over environmental issues. Great material. Take it if you're on the fence.</comment>Lectures literally are spent summarizing the readings you did for homework, which in my opinion makes them a huge waste of time. I think lecture content should be different from the content of readings you do on your own. Also this class is too large to be a discussion based class but the professor tries to make it exactly that, which makes it awkward and means you spend a lot of time listening to a handful of students who like the sound of their own voice.</comment>This course is the epitome of a high quality general education course. It engages you with not only nature and the environment, but about how different cultures view nature and the environment and even addresses our own thought processes surrounding these topics. This course was eye-opening, especially after going on the toxic tour, hearing talks from various authors that we read in class, and watching documentaries. The class involves a ton of reading each week, and the three essays you do during the class involve significant planning and analysis, but I definitely recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn about how we think about the environment and how this affects society's treatment of the environment.</comment>The readings in this course are really fantastic and offered fascinating new perspectives on how environments are socially constructed. Also, Professor Subramanian is really cool. Like, cool kids table cool.</comment>This class is horrendous. I love the outdoors and conservation, but the way this class was run was brutal. Please don't take it, unless they get rid of the discussion session. The second hour of every lecture consisted of the professor asking needlessly convoluted questions and staring while the class sat in silence for 5 minutes before someone responded with an equally esoteric answer.</comment>This class is not what I expected it to be. Definitely look at the course readings before deciding to enroll to make sure you're actually interested in the material. While only having to do 3 papers and weekly blog posts was great, I think there are more interesting SW courses out there. The lectures just rehashed the readings, and if you don't care for the readings, there's no point. There were some fascinating case studies but most of the class I could've done without.</comment>You will think about interesting questions, and likely have to rethink the way you talk about the environment. Some of the readings are tough if you don't have a social studies background and others veer away from environmentalism towards social justice, but overall gives a good selection of ideas and is relatively painless.</comment>Completely redundant. Professor Subramanian literally reads off her notes for lecture and appears show little interest in engaging with students. The readings are alright, but sometimes needlessly inaccessible or irrelevant. Lots of pseudoscience and pseudo-intellectualism. 

That being said, you will walk away with this course having gained a new perspective. Regardless of whether you agree with this perspective or not, it's useful perspective to be exposed to.</comment>The material is great (though there is are a lot of readings each week, along with weekly blog response posts), Professor Subramanian is great, but lecture is not super engaging.  The first hour of lecture just goes over the readings, and the second hour turns more to questions and discussion, but this seems to only be engaging for the grad students and a few undergrads.</comment>This is one of my favorite courses that I have taken at Harvard. It significantly changed the way I look at the world. It is rigorous, the topic is fascinating, many of the students who took it were genuinely interested. Subramanian is a very good lecturer and the readings were fascinating. Take it!</comment>The class is pretty good, but make sure you're really interested in the subject material - don't take the class just because you think it might be kinda interesting.</comment>For anyone interested in understanding the relationship between humans and environment, this course lays the ground to establish a critical position upon the multilayered and intrascalar relationship between humans and that which supports a human way of life.</comment>The readings and movies are really eye-opening. For that alone, I would re-take the class. But lecture can be difficult to sit through (1 hour of summary from the readings, 1 hour Q&A with the professor) and really needs to be revamped for future versions of the class.</comment>If you are not an anthropology student, don't take this course. You will get nothing out of it unless you like arguing about issues that don't actually have a big effect on big picture issues.</comment></course>FRSEMR 48k: Political Legitimacy and Resistance: What Happened in Montaigne's Library on the Night of October 23, 1587, and Why Should Political Philosophers Care?</title>This seminar is great. Arthur is a blast, and the highly specific nature of the material means you can guarantee meeting interesting people.</comment>Each class will engage you with philosophical discussions that will challenge you to think deeply about issues of right, legitimacy, justified coercion. If that at all interests you, it is absolutely worth taking.</comment>This is an amazing course if you have always wanted to learn about political theory and moral philosophy. Professor Applbaum delves deeply into every text and the seminar discussions are always extremely fruitful. The texts can be difficult to grapple with on the first reading but once you get to seminar, the professor will show you the meanings behind them. One thing to note, there is a lot of reading and unlike many seminars you cannot just blow it off. You are expected to do it all and if you don't it will show once you get to seminar so only take this class if you are truly interested in the topic and willing to put the work in.</comment>This is not really a history class; it's a political philosophy class. If you're at all interested in political philosophy, you'll love this class. But if you're not at all interested, this may not be the most fun class for you.</comment>This class is worth taking for the teacher: Arthur is an incredibly warm, fun, and engaging person to be around. I always enjoyed talking with him in office hours after class, he's written an amazing novel just for this class that ties everything you've learned together, and he even brought his dog Luna into class the last day. That said, the material can become a little dry at times--especially after 4 weeks of Mornay--but some of the authors, like Hobbes, are really worth reading. At times, the seminars can lean more toward lectures than discussions, but some projects, like being questioned on a position one-on-one by Arthur, are very engaging.</comment></course>CHNSE 106a: Introduction to Literary Chinese</title>If you're on the fence about this class, take it!! Chen is a wonderful, caring instructor, the texts are unbelievable, and the atmosphere is unlike any other language class I've ever taken (students reading in Korean, Japanese, Mandarin, or Cantonese, and Chen makes it all work.) Also, it's a rare college that has the ability to offer literary Chinese.</comment>I likely to recommend.</comment></course>ECON 1340: World Economic History</title>If you are looking for an easy economics class to perhaps fill the elective requirements, this is a great choice. Lectures are recorded in case you can't come to class, slides that are provided are very informative, readings and material of the class is interesting. There is only one midterm and one final, making it a good candidate for pass/fail as well should you want to use that option to get economics concentration credit. However the class becomes very repetitive although Robinson's book Why Nations Fail is great. Professor Robinson is also not a great lecturer. If you are really interested in the material but might not need/want to take the class, read his book.</comment>I never thought I'd be interested in development economics. But an otherwise weak set of economics classes this semester pushed me to take this class. And I'm really glad I did. Pretty interesting field, pretty low workload in the class in general. Robinson picks some amazing and interesting case studies as examples, and the material is very engaging. Sometimes lectures can get long-winded, but overall a great course.</comment>While I am someone interested both in economics and history, and am a fan of Why Nations Fail, I felt that reading the book alone would have been a satisfactory experience, especially as many of the other readings are covered in other economics courses. I really respected Professor Robinson's effort as well as my TFs, but sections were generally silent and the lecture material was usually overly wordy and presented in a confusing order, such that the chronology and theme of the course were generally obstructed. Great idea for a class, but could be conducted in a much better way.</comment>The readings are long and it would be beneficial to start a reading group early instead of rushing to start one before exams. You will learn a lot about the world and feel more educated coming out. I would take it if you are shaky on world economic events.</comment>Provides great insight into history while still maintaining economic cause and effect (or correlation). Covers broad sector of topics and countries/regions. Robinson is great, goes on quite a few tangents, but writes great lecture slides. Very enjoyable, fair, history class with economic undertones. Also Prof. Robinson says "llama" as "yama" which was beyond enjoyable.</comment>No weekly work which is great. Actually pretty cool subject matter to think about why some countries are poor and some rich and how some are outliers and were able to break the mold. Great Ec Elective</comment>IT's really painless and easy</comment>This class is perfect if you want a fairly relaxed class that is also very interesting. Even if you aren't an ec major, you would probably enjoy the class. It goes over basically how and why the world has developed the way it has economically.</comment>It's an interesting class that seems to grade tougher than most. Fairly interesting from a comparative politics perspective, but I'm not entirely sure you couldn't gain most of the ideas by simply reading Robinson and Acemoglu's book (which is worth reading).</comment>If you are not interested in history, then you may want to shop for another ec class.</comment>Economics 1340 gives you the knowledge to understand the causes of economic growth and the income inequality present throughout today's world.</comment>You should wait until this course becomes a MOOC.  The lectures readings are worthwhile, the lectures not bad, and the discussion sections a waste of time.</comment>I thought World Economic History was a very fascinating course. The material covered was quite interesting, even though much of the course focused on Robinson's book, Why Nations Fail (he does give people the heads up about this early on). Lectures this year were an hour and a half long, twice a week. Professor Robinson has an accent and does speak a bit quickly, so it might be difficult for some to follow along. However, he makes available his slides on the course website, which is very helpful when prepping for the midterm and final. Overall, very interesting class, in which you get to learn more about the interactions between the Dutch and Indonesians in the 1600s, or England with India, or about Somalia, the Mayans, the ancient Greeks, the Black Plague, serfdom, China, creative destruction, etc.</comment>If you take this class, make sure to read "Why Nations Fail" and pay attention to the course slides, because they pretty much have everything you need to know for the exams. Just be ready to spend a lot of time trying to consolidate all of the information by the time the exams roll around.</comment>So this class covers very interesting material, but is probably the least organized class I have taken at Harvard.  The Q guide last year warned me of this, but I thought the course heads would have seen those previous comments and adjusted accordingly.  Unfortunately they did not, so while this could be a very great class, the management of the course is extremely subpar, almost to the point of arrogance.  Nevertheless, the material and subject if fascinating.</comment>You can get away with doing none of the readings because section and exams are simply regurgitating information that was presented in class. The class is an expanded version of Professor Robinson's book. If you do decide to take the course, reading slides rather than going to class would be a better use of your time because Professor Robinson has a tendency to go on tangents. In short, if you need the credit, take the class, but, otherwise, take a class that actually makes you think and not simply repeat information.</comment>The slides hold the answers</comment>Wonderful way to run about the underpinnings of modern economic growth! Prof. Robinson is a great lecturer and this class gives you a very good overview of where we are today and the reasons behind it.</comment>Terrible class and terrible TFs.</comment>Topic is very interesting, can be repetitive, take only if interested in content.</comment>It will be extremely difficult to keep up with the materials in this course. It is often unclear what readings are actually necessary as Robinson picks and chooses what to discuss in lecture (and thus what is covered on the midterm and final). Although the material is extremely interesting, it will be very difficult to remember the level of detail necessary to get a good grade in the course for the exam portions. You will be asked to recall the names of authors of papers and obscure tribes they discuss; and as hard as you try to focus in lecture, it's nearly impossible to keep track of Robinson's lecturing style as he introduces tangential anecdotes and does not follow the slides.</comment>There is a lot of potential to improve the course's structure and it may be conceived as boring, but the content is very good, interesting and in my view of major importance for everyone's general education, no matter the concentration.</comment>A lot of reading, but really interesting and fun, not super stressful</comment>Great class and getting to work with Robinson is amazing!</comment></course>ECON 985l: Research in Development and Health Economics</title>Kiran is awesome. She is incredibly helpful and willing to answer your stupid questions along with your good questions.</comment>Go with a concentration advisor when you're choosing a 985 seminar</comment>Writing a thesis is going to be one of the most rewarded things you have ever done academically.</comment>You should really be dedicated to your topic- don't just do it to do it or you will regret it.</comment>Make sure to plan your thesis work well ahead of time!</comment>Kiran's thesis seminar on Development and Health Economics is an absolutely wonderful seminar! If you're thinking about writing a thesis, I highly encourage taking Kiran's class. She gives such individualized feedback, making time during her busy schedule to read your drafts entirely and provide huge amounts of helpful advice. You meet with her every week, and throughout the semester you also hear about other peers' theses in small discussion seminars. Kiran is also extremely knowledgeable about topics in development economics and can give helpful direction when it comes to econometric issues. She is extremely friendly and approachable! Moreover, the seminar meetings are extremely participatory and conversation-based, which fosters an environment of "learning from each other" in class. Finally, the STATA mini-course provides very helpful foundations for your thesis, though I wish a little bit more guidance and direction were given (particularly when it came to STATA codes).</comment></course>PSY 2356r: Visual Cognition: Research Seminar</title>Working in the Vision Lab is an amazing experience! The people are nice, the research they do is interesting, and lab meetings are fun and chill. If you are looking to work in a neuroscience lab, definitely consider this one!</comment>It was very easy and interesting, except it was difficult to follow almost all of the lab meetings</comment></course>VES 53ar: Fundamentals of Animation</title>You get out of this class what you put into it and it can be incredibly rewarding if you're willing to take the time to do the assignments to the best of your ability and explore the realm of animation.</comment>This class is a blend of fun and commitment. Nowhere else do you get the chance to make your own animated film in one semester! However, that does mean taking the time out of the class to work on your film and be able to take criticism in order to improve. Animation is a hard and long process, but the final product can be one of the most reward experiences you receive! As long as you commit extra hours to this class much like you would a sport or extracurricular, you too can become an animator filmmaker!</comment>TAKE THIS CLASS!! Ruth is funny, down-to-earth, approachable, and amazingly talented. I thoroughly enjoyed having her as a professor this semester. Dan is also great as a TF, and knows his stuff really well. I loved getting to experiment with different types of animation such as stop motion, sand art, etc. in addition to drawing on the computer. My only hesitation is recommending this course is for students to realistically look at their semester schedules and see how much time they can commit to this class. Animation (even though it's awesome and fun) takes a very very long time to do. I cannot stress this enough. If you have other classes with lighter courseloads, go for it!! I wish I had taken this class another semester--not because this class had anything wrong with it, I absolutely loved it--but so that I could have had more time to work on assignments. Taking this as one of five classes was extremely stressful. But overall, Ruth is wonderful and was very understanding and supportive while I was going through a hard time this semester, and I recommend anyone who is even remotely interested in animation to get to know her/learn from her. This has been one of my favorite classes at Harvard in my four years in here. I am so happy that I took this class; my one regret is taking it during a semester that was very difficult for me in many ways.</comment>This is a really fun class! You have a lot of creative freedom so the assignments are a great way to take escape papers and other classes. You have a lot of time for the final project but you have to structure your time. You'll tend to slack off early on, but if you don't then you won't have to work as hard when other classes also decide to pick up.</comment>It is a lot of work. But if you put the time in and choose a project you like you will be very happy with the results.</comment></course>CULTR&BLF 17: Institutional Violence and Public Spectacle: The Case of the Roman Games</title>This course is demanding. Professor Colemen sets a rigorous pace. But if you can match her enthusiasm and commit to the assignments with the same diligence she commits to teaching her students, you will come away with much more than just the course material. Also gladiators are badass. Trying to understand their lifestyle is the key to not being a nerd.</comment>Professor Coleman and the TFs were extraordinarily enthusiastic about the subject, and the information covered was consistently interesting.</comment>I found the content of this course very interesting. As long as you go to lecture and do the Suetonius readings for section (about 30 pages a week), you can easily get by without doing more of the readings. I think ultimately you get out as much as you put into this course, and I wish I had more time to do all the readings and engage in thoughtful discussion with my TF and peers.</comment>This is a great way to fulfill a gen ed and learn more about Antiquity. The readings are a bit long, and the course does require effort, but you will certainly learn a lot by the end of the term.</comment>if you are not willing to put in the work, you will learn nothing. Chances are, if you were not originally interested in gladiatorial combat or ancient Rome, you will not enjoy the course.</comment>The workload is manageable, lectures are fascinating, and the material very interesting. There are two papers and two exams total that make up the bulk of your grade, but the tests were not very hard at all and the papers all have very interesting prompts. Some of the readings are long, but not really that much longer than the average gen ed (and this is coming from a person with a very low tolerance for reading assignments). Professor Coleman is an amazing lecturer. Lectures are rather early in the morning, but go to each of them, not just because they're interesting, but also because all you need to do the assignments and take the tests will come from your lecture notes.</comment>Extremely interesting material, presented in a coherent structure and with great interest and enthusiasm by both Prof. Coleman and the TFs.  Readings, lectures, and section materials all really created a sense of what ancient Roman culture was like, not just on the topic of the games, but in many intersecting aspects of society, politics, religion, etc. overall.  Really enjoyed reading Suetonius, and the two writing assignments were creative and fun.</comment>CB 17 is a fantastic introduction to classics at Harvard, presenting a comprehensive overview of Roman history through the lens of gladiatorial combat while remaining accessible to students of all background levels. I'm a statistics concentrator and I loved this course. Why? Amazing teaching staff. Professor Coleman is the director for undergraduate classics studies for a reason. She cares deeply about her students and will set aside time to meet every student personally at the beginning of semester just to get to know them. She is incredibly knowledgeable in her subject and will direct you to a plethora of useful sources when you are writing your research paper. More than that, she generates incredible enthusiasm amongst her students by being genuinely passionate about her subject and encouraging towards questions. She may seem demanding at first, but you have to respect how seriously she takes teaching. Every lecture topic is accompanied by handouts filled with primary sources and she walks students through how to critically analyze different sources in class. Just an incredibly knowledgeable teacher, passionate about her subject, demanding but understanding of students -- imagine Professor McGonagall teaching Roman history. Also, the course honestly is not that bad in terms of workload. Just showing up for lecture will give you probably 95% of what you need to know. Readings are interesting and paced well. My TF Charlie was super understanding of students' busy schedules and worked hard to summarize information from Suetonius readings during our fairly enjoyable one-hour sections. Exams and papers are graded rather leniently as long as you clearly put forth the effort and are enthusiastic about learning. Highly recommended, great way to knock out a CB gen-ed, and admit it: you've always wanted to take a legit classics course at Harvard.</comment>Prepare to be amazed.</comment>The material in this course is very interesting, and Professor Coleman is very enthusiastic about teaching it! The teaching fellows are very accessible and do a great job of giving feedback on essay outlines. The reading is not strictly required for understanding the lecture, but it is useful and covers topics not discussed in lecture. This is a very interesting, relatively low workload GenEd course. Take it!</comment>This is a fantastic course! Professor Coleman is amazing--full of energy and really wants to connect with each student. She went out of her way to set up an appointment to meet individually with every student in the class over the course of the semester. If you take this course, definitely be prepared to go to lecture. Most of the material is covered during the lectures, not in the readings. I also found that the grading was a little harsher than the typical GenEd. That being said, though, the material was really interesting, and Professor Coleman is great!</comment>Every aspect of this course is excellent. The content is interesting, Professor Coleman and TFs are great, and the workload is reasonable. You would be surprised about how much learn about Roman history (not just the gladiatorial aspect), and the massive role spectacle played in it. It really gives you a different perspective on how you may have seen Roman history before, and I would recommend it to any student.</comment>This course is a pretty fun gen ed. Lecture at times may be slow and dry, but there is a lot of interesting material to learn about the emperors of the Rome, the gladiators, the beasts hunts, and the society as a whole. the main book, Suetonius Lives of the Caesars is actually really funny and interesting as well. Just make sure to work hard on the 2 assignments in regard to critiquing your writing and how precise your words are as that's crucial to scoring well.</comment>Professor Coleman is the perfect mix of orderliness, knowledgeability, and fun. She may seem incredibly strict at first, but she will be there for you, and she will make class and lecture more fun than ever. Her rule about not videotaping the lectures is a godsend, because it means you are forced to enjoy class in person! Michael is a wonderful TF who cares about his students and will answer any and every question you have. He really makes section fun!</comment>Interesting but not challenging for anyone with a writing/history background.  Fun and interesting although the lecture format gets a little repetitive.  Really good class overall.</comment>This class is fantastic. Professor Coleman is hugely enthusiastic about the material, Charlie is a brilliant TF, the assignments are creative, and the material is just so much fun. Grading/expectations are reasonable.</comment>This class is really great. Section was fantastic every week, and I found the lectures to be very interesting. Make sure to be prepared for the weekly quizzes in section though.</comment>I loved this class. Professor Coleman provides a lot of enthusiasm for the course material and brings plenty of fascinating subject material to the lectures. I found it very easy to follow along and study for.</comment>There are two major draws to this course: the professor and the content. Professor Coleman is an amazing lecturer. She had me hanging on every word and truly engaged with the material. Also, the material is all super interesting, and you will enjoy learning it.</comment>I would really recommend this course. There are weekly quizzes in section, but if you attend lectures and review your notes you should be fine. The lectures are very interesting and learning about the games -- and through them Roman culture and history in general -- is a lot of fun. Professor Coleman presents the material well and the course content is very interesting.</comment>Genuinely interesting to learn about. Quite fun facts you end up with that you would not have even considered before and generally appreciate stadiums like Harvard Football Stadium with awe.</comment>This class was incredible. I initially was interested in the course as a Gen Ed requirement, but it ended up being one of the best classes I have taken. It has a moderate work load that will give you what you put into it. Professor Coleman is awesome! Get to know her and take this class!</comment>This is a great Cultures and Belief Gen Ed. Professor Coleman is fantastic, she truly loves the subject, and she really makes it interesting. There's very little work outside of class, maybe an hour of reading a week. Two papers that are definitely manageable and the TF's are super helpful. AND you get to say you took a class on gladiators, so that's a plus :)</comment>Roman Games is a fun and interesting way to fulfill a Gen Ed requirement. The material at the beginning of the semester seems a little dry, but the course quickly picks up, and Professor Coleman is an excellent lecturer. There is quite a bit of work at a few points throughout this course, but otherwise this is an engaging, fun, and fairly easy way to fulfill a CB requirement.</comment>It is an amazing course, teaching you about the phenomenon of the Roman games, all explained by a professor whom is at the forefront of her field.</comment>So much fun. You'll be on the edge of your seat. Professor Coleman is fantastic. Meet with her! Go to office hours!</comment>This is a great class that can be extremely rewarding if you put in the effort! I went into the class with lots of misconceptions about gladiators and Roman history in general. This class has helped clear up a lot of them. Professor Coleman is an excellent lecturer and is always super helpful with anything you ask of her - just be sure to ask her early!</comment>Wonderful. Not time-constricting yet highly insightful, a great introduction into the Roman world.</comment>Professor Coleman makes it abundantly clear that it is the student's responsibility to engage the material, learn with enthusiasm, and supply the effort needed to understand what is being taught. That said, the course is extremely well taught and well organized, and a lot of fun, even to the most amateur historian like me. The professor and TFs are fantastic, and they present the material in such a way that the enthusiasm and effort on your part will come naturally.</comment>This course is truly a celebration of Roman culture, so if you don't feel like celebrating Roman culture all semester then it may not be the course for you.</comment>Great course to learn many aspects of the ancient Roman culture. Amazing topics covered in lecture, TFs are super helpful in section as well.</comment>This class is well-organized and Professor Coleman is amazing. She makes learning about the Roman Games very exciting and her power points have great pictures!</comment>This class is extremely great if you've ever been interested in Ancient Rome or gladiatorial combat. It is extremely enlightening as to what the Roman arena actually was, instead of something like Spartacus.</comment>This class is a fun class and is very interesting. The quizzes and tests are difficult to study for due to the breadth of material that can be asked.</comment>This is a great class.  Please take it.</comment>There was a lot more work (especially reading) than I anticipated.</comment>The class is well taught and well run. The teaching staff are readily available and friendly. There are two assignments during the year, both of which are manageable and incredibly well explained. The weekly assignments are not particularly challenging or time consuming either. If you're looking for an interesting course that won't take up too much of your time during the year this class is the right choice.</comment>AMAZING. Be prepared to work hard, but hard work is fully rewarded with fun and interesting knowledge.</comment>Professor Coleman as well as the TFs are fabulous!  If you have any interest in Ancient Rome take this course!  You'll really enjoy it and learn a lot throughout the semester.</comment>I really recommend that you only take it if you really have an interest in Ancient Rome.  Otherwise, you may find it hard to motivate yourself to put in the work.  If you are interested in this topic, then you'll really love it.</comment>If you are naturally curious and willing to put in good effort, this class is a worthy intellectual pursuit.</comment>This class is very interesting if one likes to study ancient history and its marvels.</comment>The subject matter very interesting, it is the greatest strength of this course. If you attend lecture, the readings are not necessary to do well, but they are usually very engaging and enrich your understanding of the material. The midterm and final exam are very manageable, and the term paper actually leaves a lot of room for creativity. This class is not about memorization, but rather about thoughtful analysis. Coleman is very knowledgeable and makes an effort to learn everyone's name. You don't need any background in Latin or Roman history to take this course.</comment>If you are at all interested in the topic, you will love it. If you are just looking for an easy class, I wouldn't choose this one.</comment>Definitely one of the easiest courses at Harvard. You can skate by with about 15 minutes of work on a normal week and really only put time in form the midterm, final, and 2 papers. Great way to fill a GenEd with what is basically a Roman archaeology/history course.</comment>If you are looking for a manageable and interesting GenEd take this course.  It is extremely well taught, easy to follow, and does not require a lot of work.  You will have to go to lecture but its not that bad.</comment>Quite a bit of reading for a Gen Ed, but do it! Most of it is actually quite interesting, and of course the material is definitely engaging. Professor Coleman is excited about her work, and her explanations are always clear and concise.</comment></course>HAA 272e: Painting and Its Discontents: Seminar</title>The reading list for this course is superb, if rigorous. Given the seminar set up, it is absolutely imperative one reads everything and considers it critically before going into class. Demanding as it is, this course was one of the most rewarding I have taken in the HAA department. The true strength is the discussion, affording one the chance to hear how Professor Lajer-Burcharth and one's peers perceive each week's material. Every meeting was incredibly interesting, informative and thought-provoking. I so appreciated the challenge this course presented and would highly recommend it.</comment>TAKE THIS COURSE ITS AMAZING</comment></course>ENG-SCI 163: Pollution Control in Aquatic Ecosystems</title>If Hannah is TFing again, be sure to be on-point with everything in your pset.</comment>Patrick is fantastic. The course is very straightforward, but interesting and fun. It made me want to be an ecological engineer! If you are at all interested in environmental engineering, take the course!</comment>If you're interested in what pollutants we're worried about, how they move in rivers and lakes, and how to treat them with large systems, this is a good course. However, due to the empirical nature of many of these topics, you'll feel like equations are being thrown left and right at you, especially once you're past the advection-diffusion material. This leads to some frustration with the work (i.e. worrying about small things like units, and plugging and chugging). The ends might justify the means if you enjoy designing (but not building) a more realistic treatment system. Patrick is also wonderful to work with and is very helpful at office hours.</comment>Take only if you're interested in water management</comment>It's a pretty tough course, Patrick basically copies the textbook to the board and you have to write frantically to keep up, but I learned a lot and I came in not really caring about water pollution but by the time we did the final project I was pretty into it. Psets were really hard, I pretty much did an all nighter every week and still did really poorly on them, but when I realized that a) A lot of the problems are almost identical to example problems in the book and b) other kids did poorly on the psets, it felt a lot better. Overall good class, if you are choosing between this or Atmospheric or Soil Chem, I think this is your best bet.</comment></course>COMPSCI 125: Algorithms and Complexity</title>A really great undergraduate CS theory course where you come out with a strong understanding of basic algorithms and complexity theory. You will learn a lot with great professors and be surrounded by very smart students.</comment>Good class if you want a fast introduction into a broad selection of theory and algorithms. You won't need too much background, but each week will be mostly new material and you'll be constantly challenged.</comment>It was a really cool class, the instructors were pretty good and very excited about the subject matter!</comment>The class is very interesting, but it does require a huge time commitment. Take only if it can be your first priority this semester.</comment>This course is probably a lot more demanding from a problem-solving perspective than 121 or 124, but the problems themselves are very well-written. The lecture notes are (usually) really clear as well and the TFs were really helpful, so I felt like I could always stay caught up with the class as long as I put the work in. This was the first year that the course was offered, so I'm sure subsequent iterations will be even better!</comment>The class is really challenging but rewarding if you make it through!</comment>Excellent, well-organized course covering the basics of theoretical computer science. Don't worry about the "Math 55 of the CS department" hype; you should find it manageable unless you're coming in with a woefully deficient background.</comment>I wish this course were available when I was a freshman. Now, the CS department joins the other departments in providing a department-endorsed method for freshmen to academically overload themselves in the fall!</comment>If you want to go into research, this is an awesomely fast paced class. If you care about tech job interviews and actual practical applications, it may be better to still take 121 and 124, since they will give you better skills and more practice (124 especially).</comment>Take this class if you want to learn the fundamentals of CS theory with suitable mathematical rigor. I'd say this class is great both for CS concentrators who want an advanced and fast-paced introduction to the subject in lieu of 121 and 124 as well as students in related fields who want to get as much out of a single semester theory course as possible.</comment>CS125 is a fantastic and fast paced introduction to complexity theory and algorithms. The professors are fantastic, the TFs were on point, and I really can't recommend this class enough. Take it to learn theoretical CS, take it to get good at job interviews, or take it just to work on cool problems.</comment>It's definitely a lot of work, and moves very quickly. The proof-based problem sets are challenging and very time consuming, but help you get a greater understanding of the material. I would say that it's possible to get them done on your own if you are super confident in this area already, but it's very helpful getting a second opinion on your solutions.
Mitzenmacher and Salil were great professors. Point blank. You'll learn a lot from them (and be in awe of how much they know/have accomplished.) 
It's imperative to study on your own and do practice problems before exams, but the exams are fair (if challenging), though it's hard to say what future iterations of this course will look like (if it even happens again), it seems they're slowly calibrating the difficulty of the course. I feel like they initially wanted it to be harder, but (1) crazy smart people stopped attending lecture, and (2) lots of people who took the first midterm and dropped tended to complain about the difficulty, leaving the rest of the class up the river.
I loved the class. Better taking a hard class with great profs than 2 less difficult ones with less exciting profs.</comment>For students looking for a challenging computer science course, I would absolutely recommend CS125. This class challenged me and allowed me to learn a lot about both algorithms/complexity and mathematical proofs for theoretical computer science. Compared to CS121 and CS124, I feel that CS125 goes through the material at a very good pace for the advanced CS student.</comment>I would highly recommend this class. Don't be scared off by the mathematical background the course suggests, I took this with very little exposure to proof based mathematics and I was fine. Be prepared to work hard, especially on the problem sets, which can be very challenging and time-consuming. A course like this seems to be the best way to learn theoretical computer science, with the 121 and 124 material integrated together.</comment>While being advertised as "the Math 55 of CS," this class is certainly not as hard or demanding as Math 55 (coming from a former Math 25er). That being said, it is still very challenging and requires a lot of work and discipline. Out of the ten assignments we had, only one-and-a-half involved any kind of programming and the rest were all proof-based questions. However, it is still necessary to have a solid programming background in order to complete those assignments since very little guidance is given. A strong math background is essential for success in this course, especially discrete math, probability, and familiarity with proofs. You should also be comfortable typing up your homework in LaTeX. We never followed a specific book, but I would recommend Sipser and CLRS as supplements.

The teaching staff was amazing and made it worth it to take the course. Michael Mitzenmacher and Salil Vadhan are two of the best CS professors at Harvard, and taking a class with both of them was a fantastic experience. Alex and Joy were also great TFs (though sadly they will have graduated by next year).

If you enjoy math and were thinking about taking 121 or 124, consider taking 125 instead. Some of the pros are the great teaching staff, the smaller class size (only about 30 people took it this year), and the fact that your peers will be smarter and more passionate about math/CS. Some of the cons are the heavier workload and the tougher exams and grading.</comment>Great class, you really learn a lot about how to make efficient algorithms, and you also learn about the theory of complexity (e.g. how to prove certain algorithms are in certain complexity classes such as P, NP, co-NP, NP-complete, RP, R, RE, and many more). It is a lot of work though, and you will need strong proof-based math experience (e.g. 25 or higher).</comment>Great class, organized well even in its first year. Material is interesting and challenging, but not nearly as difficult as being "Math 55 for CS". Comparable to Math 25.</comment>This class is challenging. While the material itself is not *too* bad, the problem sets are meant to be very difficult. You'll come out of the class with an appreciation of how hard computer science can really be, but also showed me the value of rigorous proofs in the construction of computer science and complexity theory. I haven't taken later classes yet, but according to the teaching staff, CS125 should prepare you for graduate coursework in the field. Expect many math and computer science prodigies in this course -- it really does live up to its name.</comment>A really fun class. The lectures move kind of slowly, but the lecture notes are superb, and the problem sets are interesting and reasonable in length.</comment>First of all, I think this course was fantastic - it was probably my favorite course this semester, and it got me interested in theoretical computer science. I would especially recommend this course for concentrators in related fields (Physics, Math, etc.) who are interested in learning more about CS.

However, there are some things you should bear in mind. This was the first year the class was offered, so there may be significant changes between this year and future years (for example, workload was not too high this semester, but that could change). 

Additionally, this class was advertised as being "an intensive course meant only for students with strong mathematical preparation", which I think overstates the mathematical complexity of the course. You should have familiarity with proofs in order to take this class, but you should not pay attention to Crimson articles declaring this to be a "CS equivalent to Math 55" (unless they significantly change the course next year, which is possible).

Finally, I would just recommend being careful with Prof. Mitzenmacher - he can at times be a little hard to deal with (and digging back in the Q, this is not the first time somebody has made such an observation).

Sorry for the long-winded response; there are a lot of things to mention because the course is new. tl;dr you should strongly consider taking this class, it was extremely cool.</comment></course>MUSIC 218r: 20th-Century Music: Seminar</title>a very engaging introduction to the world of new music!</comment>A fascinating survey of the new music scene in Boston and beyond.</comment>Take it! It's really interesting, and it always feels like you're witnessing history in the making.</comment>This course is an amazing opportunity to be overwhelmed--by ideas, by guests, by concerts, and best of all, by new music.</comment></course>CHEM 155: Advanced Inorganic Chemistry II</title>Great class, but not easy! Ted is awesome, and really makes the class about the material and not about the grading. He treats all of his students like fully qualified equals, and really wants to make the course a conversation and a way for students to explore inorganic (and he does a great job). It was certainly hard, and a very solid background in inorganic chemistry is needed to really understand and fully appreciate all aspects of the course. The best way to take this course would be directly after chemistry 40. But seriously, Ted and Benji are the best, and are so incredibly approachable and helpful. Do not be afraid to take this class because you are afraid you will get a bad grade. The material is very hard, but if you put in effort (even if you get things wrong) you will get credit. I really really enjoyed Ted's approach to learning/teaching, and he does a fantastic job running this course.</comment>This class forces you to become very comfortable with convoluted papers and helps you develop the framework to explain reactivity trends via MO theory. It also forces you to improve your presentation skills. The class would have been better if the readings, notes, and psets were more integrated.</comment>This is a great class!! I took it after Chem 40, and liked this class much more than Chem 40. It's satisfying to use all the Chem 40 material to learn about the current research in inorganic chemistry. The lectures are pretty interesting, but not very related to the problem sets. The psets are pretty hard, but doable (lots of MOs). The final proposal is fun and not too difficult.</comment>This is a very interesting investigation into how electronic structure of transition metals and ligand frameworks affect catalytic ability and so on. The class requires a lot of time, but the teaching staff are really helpful so you should be ok if you attend office hours.</comment>Take this if you're interested in hardcore inorganic/organometallic chemistry. If you're only sort of interested, it is going to be too much work and detail for you.</comment>This is a great class to get a feel for graduate level course work and to extend your knowledge in inorganic chemistry.  You are learning relevant information and it forces you to think creatively and critically as a chemist.</comment>Be prepared. If you put in the work to understand the material, and can relate that understanding to a group of peers, this course will go very well for you.</comment>Read the papers in depth and before class.</comment>Never again will I tell someone inorganic chemistry is a bunch of general trends with an equal number of exceptions.

Ted teaches inorganic chemistry in a fundamentally different way than any other inorganic course I've ever taken. We began by learning how to predict electronic structure and then used this understanding to predict and rationalize reactivity. I found this a much more accessible way to approach problems in inorganic chemistry.

The emphasis on small molecule activation is fascinating as well. Using electronic structure as the basis for understanding how to solve these important world-wide problems was particuarly fun and engaging.</comment>If you liked Chem 40, you'll like this course! It's basically an extension of the concepts learned in Chem 40 as applicable to the current literature. The workload is very manageable--4 psets that are somewhat lengthy but very reasonable and one proposal. No exams, which is super nice! Prof. Betley is great. I'd definitely recommend it as an upper-level chem elective!</comment></course>CHNSE Bx: Elementary Chinese for Advanced Beginners</title>don't assume your native speaker knowledge is sufficient, you actually have to study</comment>While this class is a good introduction to the Chinese language for students with advanced backgrounds, be prepared for the workload! When they say that this is an accelerated class, they mean it- the material is taught quickly and everything is cumulative, so if you don't keep up it is far too easy to fall behind. Only take this class if you're up for the challenge!</comment>Take this class! I cannot recommend it enough. Huang laoshi, Xu laoshi, and Zhu laoshi are all so nice and wonderful and really know how to teach Chinese. I learned a lot while also having a lot of fun! However, be prepared for the workload. Because this class covers two semesters of Chinese in one, there can be a lot of work. Don't let that discourage you from taking this course though! I genuinely felt that I was having fun doing Chinese homework every day. You won't regret it!</comment>Chinese Bx outside of the classroom is a rigorous way to learn a lot of Chinese characters, and quickly. However, the experience inside the classroom gets tiring pretty quickly, as it becomes the same routine over and over again, five times a week. Although there is some speaking practice, it's not nearly engaging enough. Reminds me of a typical Saturday Chinese school experience from childhood.</comment>This class is quite rewarding if you put in the effort. At times, it can get overwhelming, particularly if you fall behind on your characters. For that reason, make sure you stay on top of your assignment and constantly review your vocabulary. It is essential for success in this class. As for the environment, I thought it was wonderful. You get to go to Huang Laoshi's house for dinner at the end of the course!</comment>Be aware that it is a lot of work. Two semester's worth in one.</comment>Taking this class was honestly one of the most enjoyable academic experiences I have ever had. Looking back on the past semester, I can't believe I have learned so much in so little time. You will learn a lot and have lots of fun, since the class really feels like a small community. Definitely get to know your classmates and teachers, they are just as important in the experience of Chinese Bx as the language itself.</comment>If you're a freshman, I'd highly recommend this course just for the reason that it feels like a safe, supportive environment in what can be an intimidating campus. As for learning Chinese, if you have a decent amount of Chinese experience, I would recommend taking a higher level class because this class will be too easy for you. Bx is really meant for students who can read and write very, very little.</comment>If you want to improve your Chinese, and already know how to speak the language well, then take this class.</comment>Take it if you have a lot of background in speaking and listening.</comment>The only thing I liked more than the amount of quality material that I learned in the course was the teaching staff. Huang Laoshi, Xu Laoshi, and Zhu Laoshi are all great teachers that deserve praise for their work. I can't wait for 123xb next semester!</comment>This is an absolutely amazing course - as I'm sure many of my fellow Bx friends would tell you. You will learn a lot in not just reading and writing but speaking and listening too. The teachers really care for their students and are such great personalities in the classroom. They really understand the students they are teaching. I had pretty rusty Chinese abilities coming in (from a Cantonese-speaking family and even then, my Chinese isn't that great) - but since I'd taken Chinese in high school, I figured I'd start here instead of Chinese Ba - great decision and would highly recommend the course!</comment>This class is absolutely fantastic if you want to learn how to read/write Chinese quickly! It's not too much work, but you really do see your improvement over the semester. The teachers are kind (even when you're late) and there are a lot of extra credit opportunities. If you put in the effort, you will get an A.</comment>Chinese Bx teachers are friendly, dedicated, passionate, and committed to the improvement of their students. The real strength of this course is its full immersiveness - you are basically put into a Chinese speaking family for a week, and although there is homework every night, quizzes every week, multiple essays and tests, and a couple group video projects, the environment of the course makes it fun.

The only downside is that teaching materials are not as organized as they could be (finding note files on the course iSite is hard because lecture notes are not organized by date and the titles all look the same), and much of the grammar comes without explanation, so make sure that you are confident in your heritage Mandarin and that you don't need things explained, you just need to know how to write them.

Still, as a heritage student with two Chinese-speaking parents who learned to speak but not to write, I recommend this course.</comment>The professors care a lot, and it really translates to you learning the material better. Lectures were entertaining and informative, and homework is necessary to your success - not much can be considered busywork without motive.
Take it if you're a ABC wanting to finally learn to read and write - properly.</comment>Loved it</comment>It's a very fun course, the teachers are all super nice and they really care about the students. It may be challenging but if you work hard to do the homework and memorize all the characters, you should be fine.</comment>It's a time consuming course, with daily work ranging from half an hour to an hour and a half especially when there's a dictation (not counting studying for tests). It's not especially difficult if you are willing to put in the time and effort, as there are extra credit opportunities and the teachers are more than willing to help you if you need it. The tests are fair, but focus a lot more on sentence structure and grammar than I expected. The classroom atmosphere is fun and familial, which is great for learning a language.  If you are interested in practicing your Chinese and/or want to fill your language requirement, and are willing to put in time, this can be a rewarding way to do so.</comment>It is very helpful and the workload is not too much</comment>Take this class! Chinese Bx is a fantastic class, not only for how much you learn in one semester, but for the fantastic community that this class strives to build. Going to Huang Laoshi's house at the end of the semester was very much a highlight. The TA's are also extremely committed to help you improve your Chinese by providing lots of good feedback.</comment>Warning: assignments in this class build up with astonishing speed as the semester goes on. When that happens, you do NOT want to fall behind. 

Otherwise, fantastic class and totally worth taking if you're a Heritage student who can't read/write but can speak decently, because Harvard is one of the only places anywhere that offers a class specifically designed for this kind of person. It's part of a two-semester track, Chinese Bx in the fall (one year of beginner level) and Chinese 123xb (a year of intermediate) in the spring, at the end of which you'll be able to jump into advanced Chinese.  

Reasons why it's a great class: 
The teachers are amazing and incredibly helpful and enthusiastic. The classmates are usually motivated, though you will find some more committed than others. Keep company with the more committed students, study outside of class with them, practice your Chinese as often as possible with Chinese friends, go to office hours, and do your homework every day, and you WILL succeed. 

Problems with the class: the website is disorganized, and the coursebook is not the prettiest. In other words, minor issues.</comment>Such a great language class! Definitely take it. Not only did I learn Chinese as a language, I learned a lot about the culture. Most of the students are ABCs who went to Chinese school and didn't really care about Chinese back then. After taking the class, however, many of us have gained higher respect for our heritage and have grown to appreciate it much more. ChineseBX really tries to be a family and the teachers are so sweet. They truly care about the students. The workload is OK, if you follow the schedule they give you.</comment>The knowledge you get out of this course really depends on your enthusiasm for the material. If you are very enthusiastic, this course can be extremely rewarding.</comment>Huang makes everyday of Harvard special. She doesn't only teach the class for the purpose of helping students with Chinese; she really does go above and beyond in making sure people are comfortable with life at Harvard.</comment>it is just the right amount of difficulty if you are already fluent in Chinese, but it definitely takes a lot of time since class is every day and there is homework every day as well.</comment>One of the best foreign language classes offered at Harvard. Huang laoshi, Zhu laoshi, and Xu laoshi are also three incredibly supportive educators who truly care about teaching the Chinese language to their students.</comment></course>PSY 980f: Animal Cognition</title>Take it if you're unsure! Especially if you 1) need a class with manageable workload, not much time commitment, 2) are considering writing a psych thesis, since this will teach you a lot about how to design a good study, be really critical of all your methods, etc.</comment>Take advantage of Irene's experience to ask questions only someone like her could answer.</comment>This was a great course! Dr. Pepperberg is outstanding in her field, and gives great insights into the field of animal cognition as a whole, but also what it's like to work with animals and in the scientific community as a whole. The way our class worked this semester was that two students would present the articles each week (which ended up being about two presentations per student). This way, we had to be pretty well versed those two weeks, but could get by with just skimming the articles the other weeks, so the course load was generally pretty low.</comment>It's a great time. Time is used well and in a great way.</comment>This class was phenomenally interesting and did not require much work. Getting to interact with Professor Pepperberg was amazing. Take this course if you are at all interested in animals! So fantastic!</comment>This class is what you make of it and how much effort you are willing to put into the journal readings</comment>good and interesting course</comment>If you are looking for a pretty chill class where you meet once a week and sort of zone out while the student discussion leaders for that week summarize papers everyone supposedly "read" for 2 hours, then this is the class for you. I was personally hoping for more active discussion since this is a topic I really enjoy, but was pretty much subjected to hearing a 2-hour summary in painful detail (how else does one fill up that time?) of papers I had already read, as assigned.  This agenda in no way prepared us to write a serious critique of a scientific paper (which was the midterm) or write a project proposal (which was the final), but luckily I came in already having the skills to do so and I would recommend doing the same or else you might have some struggles.  Dr. Pepperberg was great and had some really interesting things to share with us, but to be honest I'm not really sure what I got out of this class.</comment></course>COMPSCI 250: Software Foundations</title>I would emphatically recommend this course to anyone who studies theoretical computer science or even mathematics. In broad terms, the course explores constructing a logic system and how a computer can determine something is correct.</comment>This is a pretty specialized course. If you're interested in PL you'll get a lot out of it. Also worth looking at if you're CS/Math, though the proofs we were writing were mostly about programming languages (not, for instance, group theory). Greg is a really engaging professor, so if the topic piques your interest then I highly recommend it.</comment>This course was absolutely amazing. Listening to Greg lecture is always very fun and interesting. All the assignments were very rewarding and entertaining to complete. Using formal methods is a very tedious job, one that I may never do again, but it was fascinating to touch the surface of for a semester. If you are a computer scientist and like proofs, take this class!</comment>be prepared to do some serious self study and make sure you are mathematically prepared to take this class</comment>It's a cool class where you learn a lot in lecture, but the homework assignments take a long time, are difficult, and unrewarding. Morrisett is a good lecturer who knows his stuff. You get to work alongside a lot of graduate students which is pretty neat, so you get to see a glimpse of academic life is like at Harvard if you're an undergrad.</comment>This year was the first iterations of the course, so obviously there were rough edges. I thought the focus of the course was slightly too heavy on case studies (and the actual theory being implemented) which would also be covered in another class on that topic as opposed to modeling them and proving things about them. Nevertheless, I found the class educational and would recommend it.</comment>This class is fun and interesting, and I appreciated how hard Professor Morrisett worked to make it accessible to us undergraduates.  The assignments were challenging, but the teaching staff answered Piazza questions promptly and helpfully, and we sometimes went over aspects of the homework in class, not to mention Professor Morrisett was pretty flexible with deadlines depending on how much we were struggling.

The one complaint I have is that we got little feedback on the work we turned in.  This wasn't actually that big of a deal because it isn't like there's a way to get an automated proof "wrong" once it's been completed, but it was still mildly annoying we didn't get back grades for the first pset until we had turned in the fourth, and at least for me, the feedback consisted of a letter grade and a one-line comment.</comment>Pretty good class, especially for a first-time class with no clear predecessor. As structured in this semester, the class really focuses on Coq. It can be a little discouraging to see that one needs to slog through a lot just to get something simple proven, but by and large the experience is instructive.</comment>Take it because Morrisett is awesome and so is David Darais</comment>This class is really awesome. It's unclear how viable formal verification languages like Coq are for doing anything useful (as you'll soon find out if you do take the class), but they're kinda fun, and the motivation for them is certainly clear (no more Heartbleeds).

The workload comes in spurts—for weeks you won't do anything for the class and then you'll spend hours on hours trying to prove something that probably looks obviously true. Probably my lowest workload class overall this semester, though, and a really fun experience.</comment>Especially for something in its first year, CS250 was a fantastic course.  Prof Morrisett's notes were comprehensive and easy to follow.  Know what you're getting yourself into: the class can be extremely frustrating and challenging at times, and support from the TF this semester was nearly nonexistent.  There is a steep learning curve to climb, and really being interested in this kind of stuff helps.  I wholeheartedly recommend this course to anyone whose curiosity is piqued by the material.</comment>As every new course, this one certainly did have some rough edges. That being said, it was a wonderful journey that I would retake any time.</comment></course>FRENCH Acd: Intensive Beginning French: Parisian Identity through Visual Media</title>This course is so great! Honestly it rarely felt like work because it was so much fun, and the class really bonds as a little community because you meet so much. Come into the course knowing that it takes a lot of time, and requires consistent effort - you can't cram at the end, it has to be consistent. So be sure to balance your schedule accordingly - but I can't recommend it enough! And Remi is wonderful.</comment>prepare to rely on yourself to seek out opportunities to speak in French and to make sure to understand the grammar</comment>Go the extra mile for this course, it will be rewarding.</comment>Great way to learn a really large amount of French in a really short amount of time. The format can be really fun if you let yourself get into it. It does require some creativity though. Be willing to put the time into it though. I'd think twice about taking this class with another high workload course.</comment>Fantastic. I know that with this course I feel confident applying to summer internships everywhere from Geneva to Paris to Dakar, Senegal! This is only the beginning of my French learning, but I am excited and amazed at how much I learned in just one semester. Take this course if you want a fantastic language-learning environment and if you want to fall in love with French.</comment>This was one of the best classes I've taken during my time at Harvard. It was challenging, and I learned so much, but I have also never laughed more in the classroom!</comment>I think the course is excellent in that if does teach you a fair amount of French, but I think you must have the time and motivation in order to follow through.</comment></course>CHEM 60: Foundations of Physical Chemistry</title>Professor Gordon and Mike both know quite a lot about physical chemistry, so if you're interested, you can really learn a lot. Very manageable work load.</comment>Chem 60 was interesting. The problem sets weren't that bad, but the exams were quite difficult (and required a lot of formula memorization). Professor Gordon is really friendly and kind, but also isn't the most exciting lecturer which made class somewhat dry.</comment>If you're interested in stat mech/thermo/kinetics and want to learn about it in an accessible format, this is a great course! There's something for everyone in the readings, and I found it very interesting as an applied math student. Exams can be a little memorization-based (as in, there's no formula sheet) but aren't terribly hard, and neither are the problem sets. The course ends with a final presentation/paper, which was a great opportunity to model an interesting system in terms of properties we learned about in the course. Lecture style might be dry if you're not interested in p.chem, but Prof. Gordon is really interested in making the material clear and convincing, so it helps to attend if only to ask questions.</comment>This is a great way to fulfill your pchem requirement, but if you want more than the very basics then this isn't for you.</comment>Although this class is relatively easy and non-workload intensive as compared to 20/30/40, you will most likely learn very little from this course. This year was particularly unproductive because we received very little teaching from the course's only TF. The tests did not reflect the type of questions presented in the problem sets. The lectures are very dry considering that over 75% of the lecture is just reading off the lecture slides and doing derivations. I would also recommend checking out MIT's 5.60 as a way to supplement the class.</comment></course>WOMGEN 1247: I Will Survive: Women's Political Resistance Through Popular Song</title>This class is extremely interesting and very easy to succeed in. Though the class assigns a huge amount of readings/audio clips each week, it is very doable to succeed without doing the homework.</comment>It's a new class, so maybe it will be better next year, but I found it to be unstructured, boring, and unchallenging. The only nice part was that we got to spend time watching music videos and listening to music.</comment>This class is one of the most interesting classes I've taken at Harvard so far. If you have any interest in music and the history of music in a feminist lens then this is absolutely a class to take. It is so so interesting.</comment>This class was SO wonderful! Michael and Jamie are amazing - they know everything there is to know about the subject but also have serious respect for their students. They're very accessible and give very helpful feedback. The material is fascinating and fun, a great way to frame race, gender, and sexuality in twentieth century America.</comment>This class is just as much about the history of music as it is the history of feminism; you will not look at popular culture the same way after taking it. Prepare for LOTS of reading, but the good thing is that it feels like play. Michael and Jamie are both absolutely fantastic - they make you tea if you come to office hours (and you will, because you'll end every class wanting to talk more), and you can spend hours dissecting Beyonce videos together! Overall, this was the hardest course I took this semester, but it was also by far the most rewarding.</comment>Michael and Jamie were both super knowledgeable and engaging.  The class material was incredibly interesting and lent itself well to class discussions. The weekly homework was a little heavy (lots of reading and listening to music) but it was interesting enough to make you want to complete it all. Plus, the assignments were fairly open-ended, allowing you to focus on artists and time periods you were interested in exploring. Ultimately, it was probably my favorite course I've taken so far.  I highly recommend the class! The only bad thing was that it only met once a week and we weren't able to cover all the artists in the syllabus.</comment>This class is easygoing. If your someone who enjoys structure, perhaps this class is not for you. However, if you are okay with a free-range, discussion style class, this is a great elective. It really brings history to life with amazing women and amazing music.</comment>This class is really interesting, it opened my eyes to so much new music and to how gender and sexuality influence the music industry.</comment></course>KOREAN Bxa: Elementary Korean for Advanced Beginners</title>This class truly benefits from its small class size and accelerated pace.</comment>Fantastic course. It's a lot of fun and you learn a lot</comment>AMAZING CLASS!! TAKE IT!!!! As long as you can understand and speak a little Korean take it. It is easily the most fun class I've had at Harvard, and the teacher takes you out for lunch after the final.</comment>Bxa is a great course that delves into all of the right foundations of the Korean language. It is perfectly tailored for those who have listened to Korean all of their lives, but never were able to speak it properly. The class's format is very well structured and classes become something you want to go to rather than a chore. Note that there's no shortcut to assignments and they do take a good amount of time. However, they are far from difficult and do well in reinforcing the material learned in class.</comment>Korean Bxa moves quickly</comment></course>MUSIC 152: Post-Tonal Analysis</title>one of the best classes I have taken and will take at harvard; take it if you have the opportunity</comment>Professor Hasty is wonderful, and Trevor is an amazing TA. This course will be enlightening in many ways, and is worth your time.</comment></course>FRSEMR 49g: The Holocaust, History and Reaction</title>The class is really interesting and Professor Madigan is a great teacher and keeps you engaged the whole time.</comment>This class is fantastic. The only work during the semester is interesting readings, and the discussions in class are usually very interesting. The final project can be a bit annoying. You will learn a lot about the Holocaust, which is fascinating from the psychological perspective in the midst of its abject horribleness.</comment>Take this course if you have any interest in the Holocaust. It is not that difficult, and it is extremely interesting.</comment>Prof. Madigan is delightful- he presents the course as a discussion-based, enjoyable seminar and conducts the class that way. This course provided a nice break from my heavy-workload courses.</comment>You must be able to handle more emotional and disturbing aspects of the Holocaust and have a true passion for the subject.</comment>Class is taught by an amazing professor and includes great discussions.  Classes periodically get a little boring, but if you are interested in the topic, most classes are awesome.</comment>This is a solid, good seminar. The material is obviously emotionally charged, so be prepared when you walk into the two hour course for some serious moments. While you won't walk out of class chipper everyday, it is a very enriching experience. Madigan is a great guy. He is very understanding of any personal circumstances and very approachable. Perfect to take your freshman fall. Although you don't have to put in tons of time, you get a lot out of the course. While I there are 12 assigned books in the course, you don't have to read everyone word for words, so the work level is really manageable. A great freshmen seminar!</comment>This course is great and I definitely recommend it to anyone interested in the Holocaust and this time period, or to anyone who just wants to learn more about this subject. The class is incredibly engaging and utilizes various different mediums to tell the story of the Holocaust, such as film, fictional literature, interviews, and historical documents. The class allows for great discussion and Professor Madigan is a great professor. I definitely recommend taking this course.</comment></course>COMPLIT 275: Theory of Narrative: Conference Course</title>A course that covers many great texts, poses various fascinating questions and offers many tools for analyzing narrative.</comment>Great readings, brilliant classmates. The professor is kind, rigorous, and entertaining. You won't waste your time if you enroll here.   My one criticism is that I wish William Todd had made use of the blog feature on his isite. I suspect it could have made class discussions a lot more interesting. Every week we'd come to class and you'd have the same handful of people talking about the readings, plus whoever presented their oral report on the reading for the week. Everyone else would remain quiet. I think this is partly because the class time, even though it was two hours long, really only allowed for a few people to talk, and because it was pretty big for a seminar, some individuals were more shy. If there had been a weekly online blog post assignment, there would have been more opportunity for everyone to contribute to discourse about the texts and theories we examined.</comment>A wonderful, wonderful reading list that will introduce you to the best thinkers and writers in theory. Professor Todd does a great job of orienting everyone to the texts (with an undertone of playful humor!) and has an excellent sense of how complex ideas fit together into a coherent if combative intellectual story. The presentation structure (1-2 students present on texts every day) means much of the discussion is student led and initiated, so if your classmates fall through on that day, you could miss the exegesis of your favorite text--that's unfortunate. But the ownership and knowledge you gain by doing your own presentation should make up for it, depending on how you feel about preparing it. Definitely a better course for self-starters who want to do serious reading and come in with questions that will drive the discussion in a way they prefer. Hanging along passively, while certainly possible, may leave you unsatisfied at the end, since you won't have a comprehensive survey of each reading in class. That you'll have to do on your own.</comment></course>VES 34v: Lost and Found: Sculpture Course</title>Virginia was an awesome professor. She is a really unique down to earth person. Her expectations were not always in line with what other professors in VES tend to have, and I think it bothered some students, but I had no issue with how she did things and I loved everything we did in this class. I don't think Virginia is going to stay on after this semester, which is a shame because I think she contributed really well to the VES department with her energy and perspective. SO GLAD I took this class. I think everyone should try to take a sculpture class or art class in a medium unfamiliar to them, it's a great experience and can expand your art practice in an unbelievable way.</comment>The projects were mostly unstructured, with maybe one or two constraints, which I liked a lot. The "lost and found" aspect definitely makes you look at the world differently, since you begin to look at every piece of trash as a potential resource. Sometimes Virginia had really high expectations which was intimidating, but both she and the TF Ross were very involved in making sure you had all the materials and space necessary for your projects, which was very nice. Also, Virginia knows her materials!! She was such a helpful resource for determining which materials were best, how to work with them, etc. Pretty much any strange construction object or material you could find, she would know what it was! Previous VES classes I've taken had more "detached" professors, which in some ways was good but in some ways was frustrating. So this class was different and had involved faculty which was supportive. I think it would have been better if we had been exposed to more media, and especially media that explored the "lost and found" theme. I find that being presented with a lot of media is very inspirational for these classes.</comment>Virginia and Ross are great teachers who are also very enthusiastic about helping you to work through your thoughts and projects. I could not think of a better way to start doing sculpture.</comment>this was my fist ever ves class taught by a visiting professor and while i throughly enjoyed learning from virginia, i think that the class could have been better structured. in other ves classes ive taken the deadlines for projects are set out from the beginning of the semester, and when one project would end we would start right in to the next project. this unfortunately did not happen in this class, which made many of us feel as though we were being rushed through our projects. that being said i really did enjoy this class and the opportunity to work with many different kinds of materials.</comment>Make sure you are putting in time outside of class time to finish and further develop your projects</comment></course>NEUROBIO 200: Neurobiology</title>You get a broad overview of neuroscience in this class. I think you'd learn to appreciate this class for the sheer number of speakers invited to lecture. You won't be able to get this sort of exposure to Harvard scientists elsewhere. However, we don't go into topics in much depth so some may find this frustrating.</comment>It's painful, but you'll learn a lot. Many of the lectures are wonderful, so audit if you can. If you can learn the neuroanatomy ahead of time from the old course materials, the rest of the course will be fine.</comment>I would tell PiN students that it is definitely not worth their time and effort if they've taken even one or two basic neuroscience classes in college.   If they haven't I would warn them that it's not going to be ideal, but is the only class of that breadth available to them as far as I know so it might be worth taking.</comment></course>ECON 985m: Research in International Trade, Education, and Public Economics</title>This class, like your thesis, is what you make of it. It is possible to really engage with your classmates' presentations and take advantage of Anne's assistance and expertise, and you should! I learned a lot from this first semester.</comment>Thesis writing is hard but rewarding!</comment>The senior thesis seminar provides a nice opportunity to present your thesis as it evolves throughout the semester, and receive feedback from classmates and an adviser. There are regular assignments throughout the semester such as a justification, data paper, and literature review. The semester concludes with a 25-page draft of your thesis-in-progress. Classes meet about half of the weeks throughout the semester, and individual meetings with the adviser take place on the other weeks. It's not too stressful in and of itself, though the thesis can be stressful, of course. Anne Le Brun is a fantastic teacher/adviser. I'd highly recommend her if you have the opportunity.</comment>Anne is a great seminar leader and really does try her best to help you with your thesis topic! She's always willing to sit down and chat about your topic and provides very personalized feedback where you in the writing process. It's also nice to get feedback from other students in a group setting as they can also have useful input about your project. Highly recommend preferencing Anne if you're thinking about taking the seminar.</comment>Don't be a poltroon. Write a thesis.</comment>Anne was very helpful and it was great having someone else to bounce ideas off of.  Additionally, having deadlines was helpful to keep you on track. However, the psets and deadlines often seemed like a waste of time as they weren't tailored to where you currently were in you thesis.</comment>Anne is a fantastic seminar leader! She is very hands-on and accessible and puts a lot of thought into improving the quality of your work.</comment></course>FRSEMR 48j: Moral and Political issues in Contemporary Democracies</title>Brilliant ways to understand some of the most complicated dilemmas in our world</comment>It's awesome! The discussions are lively and always intellectually stimulating.</comment>This was a really cool class for me because I tend to lean towards the science and math related classes. Exploring different fields and opportunities such as this class helped to truly broaden my horizons.</comment>It was fun to just spend 2 hours a week discussing an issue. Still, I often felt that differing opinions were not always welcome.</comment>This class was really fun. However, it was more theoretical than I expected. Do not expect a current events class, even though we spend some time on current events. We spent more time debating the origins of the natural rights of man than, say, Roe v. Wade. In class discussions were always interesting and Carla is very good at challenging your beliefs and creating interesting debates.</comment></course>FRSEMR 39p: Traveling Latin America: Empire, I and the Empirical Eye</title>The readings for this class were very interesting and whats great about them is that they are primary sources, so you get to read about the travel adventures of the people actually doing the traveling. You learn a lot about the motivations behind travel writing and how Europe responded to the literature. Overall, the class was very enjoyable. Ezer knows a lot about Latin American history and he has interesting travel stories to tell. Most of the films we watched in class were great too.</comment>FRES39 is a unique course in that it's highly self-driven and it is what you make of it. The discussions define the class in many ways, with the subject material being drawn from various sources and traditions.</comment>Vierba is a very very engaging and knowledgeable instructor. He will take you through the ins and outs of the curriculum, leaving you with questions to ponder both in class with your peers and after class on your own. Definitely worth taking if you are interested in Latin American History and (to a lesser extent) Literature, plus the how colonialism/imperialism was and is still being manifested.</comment></course>FRSEMR 25n: Understanding Psychological Development, Disorder and Treatment: Learning through Literature and Research</title>This class is unlike any other. Although weekly discussions were centered around psychological disorders, they always expanded to broad topics like mental health and resiliency (with students sharing their experiences with both). Thus, the seminar was a safe haven for students desiring to reflect and explore. You learn so much about yourself and the people around you, while gaining valuable insight into the world of psychiatry. Nancy and Justine are an incredible team: both so wise, down to earth, and compassionate. Enthusiasm was contagious. Really a 5-star class.</comment>Dr. Rappaport is an inspiration. Read everything because it's all super interesting.</comment>The perfect freshman seminar. Dr. Rappaport and Justine Wittenauer are the best professors and mentors a freshman could hope for. Their infectious enthusiasm for what they do and genuine care for their students, combined with the moving personal accounts of guest speakers, made this class an unforgettable experience. I'm so lucky to have been in this class. Take it</comment>If you are fortunate enough to be selected for this freshman seminar, take it! Dr. Rappaport is an amazing woman and child psychiatrist who is passionate about her work. The readings are not too difficult and the class discussions are quite interesting. Plus, there is chocolate every class</comment>If you have the chance to take this seminar, take it!! Dr. Rappaport is absolutely fantastic. On an intellectual/educational level, she gives incredible insights from her daily therapy work, but on a personal level, she's just so enthusiastic and kind and really does cares deeply about each student. When I received the assignment to this seminar, I hesitated in taking it because I saw a Freshman Seminar as a "waste of a class slot," but I'm so glad I took it!</comment>This class totally defined my fall semester. It was two hours, each week, that every single person in our class looked forward to. Not only was the material incredibly interesting and eye-opening, the community we formed was one of my favorites that I was a part of this semester. This course was the most interesting, fun, and meaningful one I have ever taken in my life and anyone who has the chance should take it!</comment>BEST COURSE. Dr. Rappaport is an incredible teacher, and this course covers material that is thought-provoking and fascinating. Some of the material is hard to get through, but the end result is incredible. The class requires work with weekly readings and reflections, but the end result is an elevated understanding of a broad range of mental illnesses. For certain disorders, the class gets to hear from patients living with the disorder, and that is an experience that no other seminar or class can match. This course changed my understanding and perception of mental illness by teaching me not only of the scientific aspects of the disorders, but also the human aspects. If you are at all interested in the subject and are willing to put in the effort, I highly recommend this course!</comment>It is a great course and an eye-opening one. It grants a deep, and deeply relatable, understanding of the disorders we consider mental illnesses.</comment>It can have emotionally heavy material, so make sure you're ready for that, but Nancy is amazing (there's chocolate every class!!), and you'll learn a lot about different mental illnesses and people's experiences living with them. I really highly recommend this class.</comment></course>STAT 220: Bayesian Data Analysis</title>If you know Bayesian statistics already and want to dig deeply into the underlying rational, this course is the one to go. Otherwise, pause a little bit, finish the book before taking this course.</comment>This course covers a wide range of material that any serious statistics student should know; it is a good in-depth overview of this material. However, students will find that they will largely have to teach themselves the material; often, they'll have to depend on resources outside of the lectures and textbook, because the textbook can be very difficult to read.</comment>This class is A LOT of work, including a lot of self-learning. Definitely recommend taking the undergraduate version (120) beforehand if you have no knowledge of Bayesian statistics.</comment>Look: the course topics are fascinating. You need it to be a data scientist, and Bayesian analysis is now the standard rather than the fringe.  But be warned: this class is AWFUL. When one student asked for a schedule of future topics, the lecturer explicitly said the he would be changing things around until the last minute, so could not provide any outline of topics to be covered. That's how disorganized the class was. Lectures were incoherent (the first half the time was spent discussing utterly unrelated topics while he tried to figure out what he was supposed to lecture about) and unrelated to the problem sets. It was difficult, not because the material is inherently difficult, but because we would be asked to solve problems and discuss topics that we would learn 6 weeks later. Later problem sets were in turn trivial because they used topics we had learned 8 weeks ago.  Oh, and the general G1 consensus is that the textbook, BDA, sucks. It's poorly written, fraught with typos, and about as disorganized as the course. If you actually want to learn some Bayesian analysis, pick up Hogg.  The only (minor) saving grace of the course with Giri, who made grading much less stressful than it could have been and whose sections/notes were quite good (though often completely illegible).</comment>Be prepared for a lot of stuffs.</comment>Make sure you know a lot of statistics before taking this course as it is not an taught at an introductory level.</comment>definitely necessary for advanced statics. but be aware of the course load</comment>Bad lecture. Jun's lecture notes are just terrible. Wait until Gelman teaches it.</comment>It's a good course if you're good at teaching yourself from a book. If you come to lecture knowing what's going on, Jun can give some cool insights and often discusses philosophical implications or subtle points related to the topics. Having said that, course organization is a little shaky, and you won't learn much if you just show up to lecture without spending some time with the book or other outside sources.</comment>Giri (the TF) makes this class great. Take it to understand Bayesian methods.</comment></course>SAS 123: Bollywood and Beyond: Commercial Cinema, Language and Culture in South Asia.</title>This class is wonderful and provides an excellent exploration of Bollywood and the historical context and themes of various films. Watching the films can take some time, but other than that the workload is quite fair. The weeks can get a bit repetitive, but the films are great and discussions enlightening so overall the class is highly recommended. It certainly helps one think about films - and culture and various topics in general - from a variety of angles.</comment>This is a great introduction to Hindi cinema and Bollywood. However, I would advise you to be patient in this class because the South Asians in this class often dominate the discussion, especially because the discussion is about Indian history a lot of the times (which is definitely relevant in discussing the evolution of film) and those students simply have a lot of background in Indian history. If you really want to contribute strongly, you might want to do some internet searches about the relevant events that were going on that may have influenced that film and sort of push your way into the discussion! The Professor will not expect this of you because it's not required of you for the class, but it will definitely enrich your learning in the class, and I'm more than sure that Professor Delacy would appreciate it.</comment>Richard is one of the best professors I've had at Harvard. The content, discussion and topics are great and very nuanced. Definitely take this course if you can.</comment>great course! very low workload and it's amazing to watch these movies and talk about how they represent the India of the time period in which the movies were filmed. I managed to learn a lot about India and its history, which i'm really happy about. This is def. the class to take if you are interested in indian culture, because bollywood is a major part of it.</comment>Richard ji is an amazing professor. Class discussions are great just make sure you watch the movies. We can tell when you don't watch the movie.</comment>My favorite class at Harvard - Richard is a great teacher, the movies are enjoyable (though very very long), and I actively looked forward to class discussion every week. I learned a surprising amount about Indian Culture, history, and (perhaps most surprisingly) Marxist theory in this class.</comment>This is an incredible class to take to gain exposure to the world of "Bollywood". You have the chance to watch truly entertaining movies as coursework and learn about the Bollywood film industry (and all of its intersections with socioeconomic and cultural fabric of India). This is one of those classes that you won't forget after leaving college because it exposed you to an entirely new world in a nuanced way.</comment>This is a true gem at Harvard.  I had so much fun with this class.  We were forced to sit down and watch a Bollywood movie a week.  The work outside of this was minimal and the discussion was very enriching to the movie.  I learned so much about Bollywood and its place in both India and outside, which I found to be very valuable.</comment>I absolutely love this course and would recommend everyone to take. I looked forward to class every single week.</comment></course>SOCIOL 128: Models of Social Science Research</title>Super easy, straight foward and helpful. Take it.</comment>Soc128 is a good intro to social science methods, but isn't very well structured, at least not at the moment. A lot of the material we cover pre-midterm could be covered in a shorter period of time, readings could be more focused and relevant and fewer (students are daunted by 3 huge, dense social science readings, and end up doing none--maybe 1 a week might be more effective), and spend a larger amount of time writing a legit research paper. Learning by doing. Covering all the material is important, but it's arguably just as important, if not more, to learn to APPLY the methods to actual research, and this is simply not possible when we have 4 weeks to do this (when you discount Thanksgiving and all).</comment>Pay careful attention to the syllabus.</comment>Easy social studies methods requirement. Paul is a great lecturer, but this course was not a rigorous examination of methods.</comment>Even though it's a requirement, Professor Chang makes this class as fun as he can. He has a very humorous and engaging lecture style. Assignments were very straightforward, you knew what you were being asked to do.</comment>it's actually the easiest class ever</comment>It is very easy and straightforward.</comment>Take it! Paul Chang is a great instructor, is really nice, and has lots to say from his own research experience. It's not too difficult, but it's hard to make the material any more difficult than it is already anyway. Paul tries really hard to make the course lectures fun (with success) and the readings are excellent. Try to take other courses with Paul as well!</comment>This is a really easy way to fulfill a social science methodology requirement (I'm speaking as a Social Studies concentrator), and the assignments/midterm are very, very straightforward.  
But for someone who has zero knowledge about social science research, this is definitely a nice place to start.

Professor Chang is an enthusiastic, nice professor who is really into what he studies---but since it's a methodology course, we're limited in the actual interesting things we can cover. Despite that, I feel that Professor Chang puts a lot of effort into making each method interesting and applicable to any future research.</comment>I took this class as a requirement for my secondary field, and as far as requirements go, this wasn't a bad class at all. The material was easy, the assignments weren't hard. The group project at the end can be a bit of a pain, but overall this class will do an effective job of teaching you how to put research methods into practice.</comment>Don't take this unless you absolutely have to. If there is still a final group project, run away as fast as you can! The midterm and the other assignments were very easy, and the presentation of the material was superficial. If you are considering taking this for social studies, I would highly recommend you find another methods course.</comment>It's a good class, but will probably teach you concepts you already have learned. As far as required classes go it wasn't bad.</comment>If you have to take this class as a concentration class, take five classes. Some of the material is very rudimentary and you will not feel intellectually fulfilled if this is one of only four classes. I wish I had known that before I took this class.</comment>This tasted like a requirement the whole way through. I really like Professor Chang, and there was a lot of material that was helpful. But it wasn't particularly intellectually challenging until the final, which was a group paper so that diluted its success as an assignment.</comment>This class was very engaging and I enjoyed it more than I expected.  It helped me inform my concentration choice, which was great.  The readings are cool and worth reading.</comment>It's so easy to slack off...don't do it!</comment>Generally an easy course with a fun research project in the end that allows for exploration of personal interests</comment>This is a course that every student should consider taking if they would like to be more aware of how the statistics that we see every day are derived.</comment>This course is a very good way to begin a sociology concentration and provides a helpful overview of types of research in the field, inspiring you to think about your own research in the coming years. Many small, practical assignments keep this course interactive.</comment>for sociology concentrators this class is required, but honestly this is a very painless requirement. the midterm wasn't bad, and the final project was actually kind of fun. its all about what you put into this class, that being said if it wasn't a requirement i probably wouldn't have taken it.</comment>It's mandatory, people barely show up to class and I wish it were better because it's meant to teach us the foundations of sociological research.</comment>Take this class if this is your first class in sociology. You will really learn what it is like to work in this field.</comment>As a Social Studies concentrator, I was required to choose from a list of methods classes, and this one was very painless and actually quite helpful for qualitative research methods. I now understand how to do interviews and content analysis. Quantitative, not so much.</comment>This class is incredibly easy yet super useful. The research skills that one learns through class are so important if one is considering conducting research in the future. The teaching team is fantastic because they are so enthusiastic about the material and provide a lot of help and assistance. It's a little frustrating that so many people don't go to lecture because what we go over in class can easily be read on the powerpoint. It's pretty low time commitment...until the group project at the end. That was pretty difficult but a good opportunity to apply the course concepts.</comment>This course is relativey painless and teaches the material very well.</comment>If you no exposure to research methods, Sociology 128 is a great introduction. The data assignments are low-pressure and extremely effective at teaching various concepts. However, the final project threw many people for a loop.</comment>light workload, doesn't require much except showing up to lecture and listening. the group research paper is kind of a pain not b/c it's a difficult assignment, but b/c  you can't choose your groups so just hope that you get a good team</comment>I took this class when I was still trying to decide between Social Studies and Sociology as a concentration. It is great that it counts for Social Studies credit. I learned about the techniques sociologist use in their research, but learned about nothing in depth. I did not like how I didn't have to go to lecture because most of the class was just definitions from a powerpoint.</comment></course>MATH 258x: Random Matrix</title>Read the notes before class. Print out the notes to follow and refer back to during class. The arguments in this class are very long and hard to "chunk"/remember. It is therefore hard to notice all the important details necessary to follow later steps when they happen--just keeping track of all the defined variables was hard enough for me.</comment></course>CHEM 30: Organic Chemistry</title>I tend not to take it very seriously when people say in their Q comments that a course is difficult: many of the comments on LS1a, MCB 52, and CS50 say those courses are really hard, and I didn't have much trouble with any of them. But Chem 30 is exactly as hard as all those comments say. I have never before in my life taken a course this difficult, and I hope that I never will again. It's worth it, because the material - though brain-bendingly hard to grasp (and there's a ton of it) - is incredibly fascinating, but just barely. Clear out your schedule for the semester you take it. This is not a course you can do halfway. No assignment in Chem 30 is curved - they like to say that means that "everyone can get an A", but realistically this means that if every student in the class gets a failing grade, then every student in the class fails. The exams are structured in a way that can sometimes make already-hard material even harder (four questions. If you get one wrong, you're out a quarter of the points.) I'd still say take it, but definitely know what you're getting into.</comment>This is a very challenging course, but one of the most rewarding you can take at Harvard. Even if you did well in Chem 20, be prepared to work significantly harder in this class. The first exam can be humbling and can come as quite a shock. Study hard. Read the book if you're confused, but most of the time it's not necessary as the TFs (at least this year) were absolutely fantastic. Unfortunately, you won't get the privilege of learn from Professor Ritter, but the teaching staff is generally wonderful and you'll learn a TON. You'll look back at the start of the semester and wonder how you learned and understood so much so fast. Take this course! It's a highlight of my time at Harvard so far.</comment>While this course is not actually that much work (problem sets due once a week require ~6 hours the day before and exams only really require ~8 hours of studying over the day or two beforehand), it is really stressful because the professor is constantly trying to make everyone think they're going to fail and will mock students for wrong answers during lecture. It is also the sort of course where it is very tempting to put in a lot of extra work and end up doing no better. If you work as hard as in Chem 20, you will do fine. You will learn a lot chemistry and find out whether it is something you want to pursue further. I do, however, think there are a lot more people are leaving this course realizing they do not want to be chemists than leaving the course absolutely hooked on chemistry. I think this course could be a lot better next year with a less aggressive/more supportive professor.</comment>This class is extremely hard. No doubt about it - the professor told us that on the first day. But it's worth it. I felt that I've been put through a whirlwind of organic chemistry over the semester, but at the end, I've learned so much and now feel that I have a thorough knowledge of the material.</comment>The material is positively amazing and you come out with a really strong understanding of what is actually going on in a reaction. Prof. Ritter started off the class saying that we would end up seeing the personality of a molecule, and it's a true statement. Though a decent amount of work is needed, you come out with a good grasp on how elegant, specific, and powerful some reactions are and a great appreciation for the genius of the scientists who invented them.</comment>This class is by far the best taught and most interesting class I've taken at Harvard.</comment>The course is very rewarding. But it is also extremely difficult. Make your choice.</comment>One: best course I've taken here. A huge amount of material is covered masterfully, and we all came out badasses.
Two: the review lectures are NOT OPTIONAL. They teach new material and explain the lecture material in new, essential ways. Go to or promptly watch all of them.
This is a damn difficult course, but it doesn't have to ruin your life. If you put in the time right away instead of in the week before the midterm, you can rock it. The first time you see a mechanism, practice it that night until it's easy.</comment>This class is extremely challenging, but if you put in the effort and really engage with the material, it is also very rewarding. Be prepared to spend a lot of hours with the material and to grow through the struggle. However, the experience was seriously so rewarding. This class makes me excited to continue to learn about chemistry more in depth in the future.</comment>I would recommend this with enthusiasm *to those who have enough prior orgo knowledge.*  While this class does take a lot of time, you really do learn a lot and get a chance to bond with classmates through the psets.</comment>Chem 30 is one of my all time favorite courses at Harvard. I learned so so so much and I am really happy that I took it. i'm convinced that it's the best Intro Organic class in the country. Chem 30 is also the hardest class i've taken at Harvard. You are probably reading a million other people saying this so instead of telling you how hard it is, here are my tips for success in Chem 30 that i wish i had known from the beginning. 

1. Organize Notes in Chapters, not Lectures. I started the year organizing them by lecture and then rewrote my notes as chapters. This course is designed in chunks that are all very logical and it was hard to see connections within the chunks when i used the lecture system.

2. Start Psets as soon as you get them, even if you can't do it all. Look through the Pset on monday night and be prepared to look for what you see in the Pset in lecture. 

3. Read the assigned reading THE NIGHT BEFORE lecture. Having a basic understanding of what the professor will go into in detail the next day is HUGE. When i did this it was much easier for me to understand what was going on in lecture as it was happening, and I actually absorbed information instead of just struggling to keep up with the notes being written on the board. 

3. Consult TF regularly on an individual basis with questions.

4. Keep a list of the key concepts, reactions, and retrons you learn about and keep a list of things you got wrong on problem sets and exams.

5. Do ALL the practice problems that you can... all of them... twice. The more you familiarize yourself with problem solving the better you'll get at it and you may see a problem on an exam that is similar to a practice problem (saved my butt on the second exam).

Lastly: if you can't think of anything else, try an ene reaction :)</comment>Chem 30 is hard. Very, very hard. If you think you've taken a hard class before, think again. However, Chem 30 is also an excellent class. You will learn an incredible amount of material and you will leave the class with a strong understanding of organic chemical reactions. Expect to spend many hours a week working on problem sets and preparing for exams (even weeks ahead of time). 

This course can be intimidating, but don't be afraid to challenge yourself if you're truly interested in understanding chemical reactions. You will not regret taking this course despite its difficulty. To top it off, there is a really great teaching staff that will help you succeed.</comment>You learn a lot from this course, and have a great sense of accomplishment at the end of it, and throughout the course as you master concepts. The biggest thing about this course is that you need to be willing to put in the time. Expect to put in lots and lots of hours into this course, and if you do, you will succeed. The key to success is to have seen every permutation and combination of the material that they can possibly throw at you; don't try to figure things out on the exams.</comment>As Ritter warns, this is the hardest organic chemistry class in the country. be prepared to work harder than you've ever worked and not get the scores to show for it. this was the hardest class I've taken at harvard, but I've learned so much because of it. you will leave the class with great satisfaction of how great of an organic chemist you've become, but possibly at the expense of your happiness (and sanity) during the semester. if you love chemistry and want to get really good at organic synthesis, this class is for you; if you didn't like synthesis in chem 20 then take chem 27 instead.</comment>Chemistry 30, unlike related courses, Chemistry 17 and Chemistry 27, covers organic chemical synthesis in great depth and forces students to apply the material to synthesis problems derived from interesting and groundbreaking work in the field of organic chemistry. At the same time, it is challenging and arguably one of the hardest undergraduate courses offered at Harvard, so a great deal of time and persistence is needed to stay on top of course work.</comment>You had better have really loved first semester orgo and be slightly masochistic to take this course. You have to be ready to spend relatively insane amounts of time on this course, or you will not succeed. Psets are hard, and not a guaranteed hundred, and this course slows down for nothing. An incredible amount of knowledge is dumped at your feet, and if you don't use every resource to put it into your brain (textbook, review lecture, practice problems), you will literally find yourself siting with a 30% or worse on the first exam. With that being said, if you're ready to spend the time and do the work, you can do well in this class. The TFs are super accessible; you can come to them with anything. Do all of the practice problems, read the textbook, and it's gonna be okay. I promise this class will not kill you. And when you come out of it, you're gonna be walking and talking like a chemist, and have more orgo knowledge than any other undergrads leaving their first years in orgo. This class will force an amazing work ethic upon you, and make you feel more stupid, and more brilliant than you ever have. If you feel ready for that, it's an amazing course. Take it.</comment>It is hard.  Really really hard.  You can put in the time and the blood, sweat, and tears, and still not get the return you were looking for.  I loved Chem 20 but this was a whole other ball game.  Use the textbook, do the practice problems, but realize that this is one of the hardest courses you will ever take and that you will probably have to come to terms with getting a shitty grade.  If you get off on the wrong foot, it will be extremely easy to get demoralized and to not want to try anymore, especially since it will probably feel like you would get the same grade regardless.  This course actually changed my mind about being a chemistry concentrator.  I can't say that I regret taking the course, because I have learned a lot of interesting material, and chemistry has always been a passion of mine, but this class can wreck you mentally.  Of course, this is Tobias's last year, so who knows what direction the course will go in in the years to come.</comment>I would rather skin myself alive and proceed to jump into a vat of concentrated acid than take this course again.  Hell would need to freeze over before I would take this course again.  This course effectively ruined my life, my self-esteem, and my mental well being.  There is absolutely NO way to succeed in this class unless you are comfortable devoting YOUR ENTIRE LIFE to this course.  If you take this course, you will lose friends, you will lose your sanity, and you will question your existence.  DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE; AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE.</comment>Only take this class if you want to work hard, ADORE chemistry, and feel like you are very good at it. So if chem 20 wasn't hard for you and you loved chemistry-- take it. If either of these two components don't hold, heavily reevaluate if you want to dedicate so much time to a class that probably won't give you any rewards in terms of grades. Make sure you love chemistry so much that taking this class will be rewarding, regardless of grades</comment>I rated this course as "likely to recommend", not because I don't think it was an amazing class but because I would not recommend it to everyone. This course is not impossible but it definitely is not for everyone, you have to really have a desire to learn the material in order to succeed. If the only reason you're taking orgo is to fulfill premed requirements and not because you think orgo is fun, fascinating, rewarding etc, then I probably wouldn't recommend it to you. I don't say these things to intimidate anyone - in fact the level of intimidation surrounding the course it a bit excessive - it really is manageable as long as you dedicate the time to it. Plus, this year's teaching staff (Gregg, Claudia, Tobius) were so dedicated to the course and helping us succeed that it was hard not to want to match their enthusiasm and succeed. Success, is relevant in the class though - don't walk in expecting an A, but do walk in expecting to be highly rewarded for your work and to learn more than any other class will teach you. In terms of advice, the three biggest things I can say are 1) do not let yourself fall behind, ever 2) find a small study ground to p-set with 3) go to office hours. Other advice would probably be to not take another course that requires a high time commitment. I can honestly say this was the best course I've taken at Harvard and although it made this semester a personal and academic challenge to test my limits I will always look back on the time and work I put in with a positive light.</comment>I think Chem 30 has been one of the most rewarding classes I've ever taken. It's definitely incredibly challenging, and you cannot underestimate the amount of time and work that this material takes to learn and understand. But at the same time, I feel confident walking away from this class knowing that I am a chemist who knows my organic chemistry - without a doubt. It feels like the amount of work and time I put into this class consumed my semester, but I loved every minute of it.</comment>Tighten up your skates, this is the real deal.  You will never be so frustrated with a class.  You will never feel so hopelessly lost in material, so deeply convinced that you are just not smart enough to understand.  But then you will look back and realize how much you've learned and how you now have an intuitive understanding of what felt impossible only months before.  This class changes how you see chemistry and it's really quite incredible.  However, the only way to induce this epiphany is to really put you through the wringer and make you really work and struggle.  Be aware of this and don't (DON'T) kill yourself with other hard classes during the same semester.</comment>You learn so much chemistry in this course that it almost becomes mind-boggling, and indeed the exams will certainly challenge, surprise, and confound you. But if you are willing to devote the time and effort that organic chemistry at this level demands, you'll get so much out of the course that it all becomes worth it.</comment>The material for this class was very interesting after the first midterm, I genuinely enjoyed doing problems and syntheses by the end of the semester, and I feel like I could now look at most any complex molecule and figure out how to make it. That being said, this was the hardest semester of my life and the other classes I took were fairly easy. This class was excruciating at times and if you want to do well you can, but it will probably take over your life. It was also frustrating to feel like the course was hard at times just for the sake of being hard and certain concepts just weren't fully taught. The TFs work incredibly hard for this course but at least for me they weren't helpful. You probably have to take this course if you took Chem 30, and if you do I recommend doing all the assigned reading and all the practice problems (actually all the problems in general) at least three times before each exam.</comment>TL;DR: Hard? Yes. Doable? Yes. Worth it? Absolutely.

I'm probably not going to say anything about Chem 30 that you won't read before and after this comment, but, as this class has taught me, repetition is the key to mastery. It's by far the best class I've taken at Harvard: a brilliantly designed and executed experience that gives you a deep chemical intuition that allows you to understand not only what reactions occur, but why they occur. For real, if you do take this course, go back at the end to the first Chem 20 midterm and see how ridiculous the mistakes you made seem - it's absolutely insane how much this class (and the 20/30 sequence in general) teaches you. Of course, with that comes the fact that Chem 30 is unapologetically difficult. Do not come into the class thinking you're going to do well, even if you killed 20; 30 is a completely different animal. Most likely, you won't be able to just learn everything through osmosis by showing up to office hours and review sessions and watching whoever's running them (Ritter and his head TF Greg are leaving for Germany, so I won't be able to say much about the teaching quality of future versions of the class) write stuff up on the board; you really have to sit down and actively engage in practice problems. It takes a lot of work, and you'll start to see the stuff in your sleep, but at the end of the day (i.e., the final), everything will start to clear up and you'll be shocked at how much chemistry you've been able to internalize.</comment>It will definitely be the hardest class you take that particular semester. Make sure to allow enough time to devote to it.</comment>TAKE THIS CLASS! Yes, it is a hard class, but it is also an incredibly rewarding class! Hands down, this class is far superior to the chem 17/27 sequence. Entering this class, I had some idea of how orgo worked from Chem 20, but I didn't really learn orgo and its power until Chem 30. Chem 30 provides you with a very powerful synthetic toolbox, and really makes you a real chemist. There are so many synthetically useful tools such as enantioselective aldols, pericyclic reactions and transition metal reactions that are really cool. Almost everything about this course from lectures to problem sets are top notch!</comment>Great, but extremely difficult, time-consuming, and demanding. You learn an incredible amount -- but it will be tough.</comment>It's different from chem 20. People like chem 20. The entertaining material covered, the high expectations, things I enjoyed about chem 20 still remain in chem 30, but without a supportive atmosphere. The expectations become too high, and the concepts become very difficult, which can be manageable, but there's no one there to catch you if you fall, it felt like. Only a man standing over you telling you you have to do better. I stayed in the class purely out of spite, but several others dropped it. Shop it and see if you can handle such an atmosphere.</comment>This course is incredible - the sheer volume of chemistry you learn makes the course rewarding. You will be prepared to read all of the synthesis literature, and will appreciate the clever parts of each pathway. This course is also hard - it will take you apart and put you back together, and afterwards no course will seem scary. Do the problem sets on your own, then go to office hours, and do the practice problems twice. Unlike in chem 20, simply knowing how to interconvert functionality is not enough - you need to approach syntheses by figuring out how to take them apart, especially after the first exam. Take this course and your brain will grow.</comment>A must take for anyone interested in organic chemistry!</comment>This is a really really good course.  It's also really really hard, so if you don't want to go into chemistry (I'm looking at you, pre-meds), don't take this class!  That being said, you learn a LOT and at the end of it, I felt really good about having taken 20/30.  During the class itself, it's hell.  Expect to spend most of your weekends working on the problem sets and the week before midterms panicking.</comment>The tests are unreasonably difficult but the teaching staff is completely committed to bringing you up to the truly unreasonable standard expect in test preparation. The tf's will meet with you individually if you are struggling and have plenty of office hours. 

Aside from personal meetings with the  TF's, nothing will prepare you for the exams. I don't care if you look over every practice problem and memorize every lecture note, it is very easy to lose points and the exams are just not representative of your knowledge base of organic chemistry which I find unacceptable.</comment>Listen up - this is easily one of the hardest classes at Harvard if not the hardest. Think twice before you take it, and then think again. It isn't a class to take just because you liked Chem 20. If you're a Chem concentrator then you should take Chem 30 - if you aren't - consider taking Chem 27 or something else. If you are going to take this class then make sure your other classes are easy/maybe consider taking only 3 classes. Even with that - this class will be a journey. You know how they would send young boys into the woods to trip on drugs and fend for themselves as a spiritual journey? Think of this class like that, except with less drugs and more psets. 
Honestly I had never truly understood how some people at Harvard struggle so much on a mental basis seemingly because of their classes until Chem 30. I am a really upbeat person who loves Harvard and really likes chemistry - this class straight up messed with my mental health. I can honestly say that this class ruled my life this semester and led to what has so far been my saddest time at Harvard. I know people who lost hair over this class and I know people who have become depressed because of this class. It tests your ability to learn material in a big way and pushes you to your absolute limit. 
Now, with that warning in mind I can't pretend the class didn't do what it set out to do. I do feel extremely knowledgable about organic chemistry and have developed an incredible chemical intuition. There's no doubt that I have gained some mastery over this material - but it has been a very tough experience. 
Ritter is an excellent professor - if terrifying. 
If you decide to take this class (and I do seriously recommend considering all your options before you do) then follow my advice:  a) Do the readings in the syllabus and take notes. b) memorize your reactions and your mechanisms as soon as possible c) do all of the practice problems when they come out and once again before the exams d) pray. 
DO NOT TRY AND PREPARE FOR TESTS A WEEK AHEAD OF TIME. IT WILL NOT WORK. 
I hope I've dissuaded some of you from taking this and given good advice to those of you foolish enough to take it anyway. Good Luck.</comment></course>HAA 179x: Construction Lab : Conference Course</title>It is an awesome experience to be able to build something large-scale with teammates, really design and consider each detail in a structural framework, and to be able to work with "real" materials outside of model-making. Though it does take a large time commitment (anywhere from 15-30 hours a week during project-building), the skills you gain and partners you find are well worth the time. Mark, Mike, and Alex are a triple-threat teaching force! Whether you're a concentrator or just interested in this as an elective, you'll have a ton of fun and gain practical skills, as well as an intuition for structural physics. One of the best courses I've ever taken at Harvard.</comment>This class is a lot of fun. You develop real design and construction skills in a supportive team environment. Very manageable workload for the GSD. Mark, Mike, and Alex are all friendly, helpful, and very invested, which was much appreciated.</comment>Regardless of your concentration, this class will effect how you think about what you're interested in. Be prepared for lots of teamwork.</comment>The best class that I've taken at Harvard. The course is rigorous without taking itself too seriously. I feel like I grew so much technically over the term, and will never be able to look at architecture/furniture/woodwork the same again. While frustrating at points, working in teams throughout the term made this course so much more fun and rewarding.</comment>As said by the name: if you want to take a construction lab, offered in the graduate school of design, then have no doubts; take this class as if your life depended on it.   We had an incredible amount of resources at our disposal, an extremely dedicated and helpful staff, challenging and rewarding projects, and overall an excellent introduction to the practical aspects of construction and design. You get to do things comparable to the core classes in the graduate school of architecture, which is truly awesome.  This doesn't mean the course is easy. You'll spend a lot of time in the wood shop honing your craftsmanship and building whatever bizarre thing you designed. The class has a one hour lecture and a three hour review on friday, which can be long if you are not interested in critiquing your classmate's creation. Also make sure you have time cleared during the week for building. Working at the front end of the time limit is the best thing you can do to yourself.  Also, do not pay attention to the "concentrators only" tag, they welcome other backgrounds and points of view. The class is especially interested in the "hands on" aspect and in aesthetic qualities, not in the general culture and theoretical side.   In sum, I would say that if you have the interest and time you should not even dream of missing this fabulous opportunity.</comment>If I could take this course again I would! I loved ever second (even the all nighters)! Mike, Mark, and Alex were so much fun to work with. This was the best class I have taken in my time at Harvard!</comment>This class is a lot of work but is worth it. It is a completely different class than the ones you have taken before. The lectures do not have much to do with the projects, but they are really engaging. The projects themselves take up a lot of your time, but the discoveries that you make are well worth the time put in. Everyone is available to help at any point and want to make sure that the project is the best it can be.</comment>Fantastic! So much fun! Rarely does one come by a class that is this unforgettable!</comment>Such a wonderful class! Take this to learn a lot and have a great time doing it!</comment></course>FRENCH 50: Upper-level French II: Recounting the Francophone Experience: Love, Loss, and Rebellion</title>If you want to brush up on your French and learn how to write an actual analytical essay in the language, take this class! There are lots of assignments and busy work, but overall it is very manageable if you stay on top of things. This class greatly improved my French writing abilities and also boosted my confidence in speaking. I highly recommend this class to anyone who wants to sharpen their French skills or prepare to enter a higher level French literature or business class.</comment>This is a great class! Dr. Chevant brings so much energy to the class that it is impossible not to become engaged in the subject. The homework, essays, and tests were all reasonable. You do have to put work into this class, but, as long as you do, the class will be a breeze.</comment>Dr. Chevant is amazing! She really cares about all of her students becoming better writers regardless of their background coming into the course. The course is extremely well-organized, and you learn a lot about different types of writing in French.</comment>This was an absolutely wonderful class, one of my favorites of the semester. It was a relaxed classroom setting that made learning french fun! The composition are not too difficult and Dr.Chevant will go over anything in your composition you want to know how to correct in office hours. Definitely would take it if you want to polish up your writing skills in french.</comment>If you want to make huge improvements in your French writing and comprehension abilities in the course of a semester, definitely take this class!</comment>One of the best French classes I've taken at Harvard! Participation and speaking is highly encouraged, and its writing intensive, but you improve a lot on grammar and speaking.</comment>Dr. Chevant is a fantastic teacher who really puts in the effort to help her students succeed in the course. The class is very small and intimate, with participation required of each student. Overall this is a great way to improve French writing and speaking skills with a very manageable level of coursework.</comment>If you are at all interested in improving your writing skills in French, I highly recommend that you take this course. Prior to French 50, I would say that I felt relatively comfortable speaking in French (I could get by on a trip to France), but I was terrified of having to do any writing. Over the course of the semester I went from writing ten sentence paragraphs about my home country to crafting two-and-a-half page argumentative essays.
The class itself was very enjoyable - you got a sense that everyone wanted to be there (unlike in some of the lower level language courses). Grammar exercises were very relevant and to the point, and we got more than enough practice integrating these into our compositions. Exams were very fair and students knew what to expect.</comment>Excellent class with great instructors. Your writing will drastically improve.</comment>I've taken three French classes here at Harvard (30, 40, 50) and while I loved all of them, this one was my favorite! It's difficult and demanding but also Dr. Chevant is SO helpful and encouraging and provides all the help you need. It's fascinating and you learn a lot of wonderful new words and ideas in French, and I thoroughly recommend it without hesitation. It's a lot more writing-focused than the previous courses, but you learn a lot and it's definitely worth the effort.</comment>Great course--just, please, if you are fluent (you know who you are) DON'T TAKE AN INTERMEDIATE COURSE! Really just not fair to the rest of us :(</comment>The compositions are lots of fun and the discussions in class can be pretty deep as well, especially considering that everyone is speaking a foreign language but speaking about issues like race relations and gay rights. Phenomenal course!</comment>This class is a solid French class in which you will have the opportunity to grow in your speaking and comprehension skills, but mostly, to grow as a writer. I was immensely satisfied by my ability in this course to write papers that I could have written in an English class and felt good about. Writing a poetry analysis in French? Immensely gratifying. Tali was an excellent TF, and her constant emphasis on the "Champs Lexical" has stuck with me in ALL my writing classes.</comment>I thought that my writing really improved throughout this course. In class conversations were very relaxed, and the class didn't focus too much on grammar, which was nice.</comment>Not terribly challenging, just put a lot of effort and time into the blog posts and compositions and you'll be okay</comment></course>PSY 2410r: Laboratory Research on Emotional Disorders</title>Professor McNally is a great professor, and everyone in the lab is really nice and accommodating. I learned a lot</comment>This class is really a great learning experience, but be expected to accommodate your schedule around the lab schedule. Also, you will be held accountable for just about everything that you do. Although there is great responsibility that comes with this class, it really teaches you a lot.</comment>Professor McNally's research is extremely interesting and compelling to the clinical psychology field, and the RA position is a great one because you are able to interact with many different types of studies. I was trained for an exercise study, coded and transcribed complicated grief material, acted as a participant to test a few studies, and even worked as a confederate for an anxiety study. This lab allows you to have many different roles in research, and you learn a lot from this exposure. Additionally, the group lab meetings kept us informed of new studies in the lab and ideas that the labs wants to research further. I bonded very much with my fellow RA's through our discussions coding specifics, as well as I was able to gain some important advice from the grad students and Prof. McNally. Being in this lab was definitely a necessary experience to pursue my interest in psych, and it was extremely enjoyable!</comment>McNally's is an exceptional lab experience. While doing lab work isn't always fun, this lab is great because of the research it is doing and the people who are conducting it. So many generous, intelligent people willing to share their thoughts and time, which is invaluable.</comment>I enjoyed it, but the work is a bit tedious and one needs to want to work in a psych lab and be prepared for that.</comment></course>FRSEMR 21i: Evolution, Buddhism, and Ethics</title>This class will blow your mind and force you to think deeply.</comment>Professor Wakeley is a very knowledgeable professor that is clearly invested in the material that he teaches here. This makes for really engaging discussion that he generally leads to develop organically, though not without purpose. Overall, this class was awesome: the workload incredibly reasonable, the material interesting.</comment>This is a great course if you are really interested in the topics. Some of the readings really blew my mind, others were a little tedious. Class discussion wasn't fantastic in my group which I think stemmed from everyone's difficulty trying to come to solid conclusions about the topics, which in many cases there never was. When you have to lead discussion, try to remember the big picture for that week, to help herd discussion in the right direction.</comment>You get out what you put into this course. If you do all the readings and participate/pay attention in class, you will come away with a good understanding of some basic Buddhist principles and how they can be related to a few interesting modern ethical issues (cloning, organ donation, etc.) However, it's entirely possible to do virtually zero work for this class: the only times you have to do the readings is twice- when you are the discussion leader- and you have to write a very simple final paper for the course. Other than that, no one will no if you do not do the work.</comment>Very easy course, little work. Very nice and smart Professor. Can be a bit boring sometimes though.</comment>This class was not as exciting as I expected but it was still a good low-stress freshman seminar and Professor Wakeley was a great professor to get to know over the semester.</comment>This class is pretty awesome. It's one of the freshmen seminars that doesn't require much work. Professor Wakeley also really knows this area/material well so you will learn a lot from him. The discussions are also a pleasure.</comment>If you take this course seriously, it can be transformative. Educationally, the setting is ideal. You are surrounded with 11 other students and Professor Wakeley. It is an environment in which questions and confusion are welcomed. You can go as deep as you like into what interests you, and if you really push yourself, you'll come closer to understanding the difficult texts and concepts this course grapples with.</comment></course>OEB 399: Topics in Organismic and Evolutionary Biology</title>A good way to get to know the department and resources offered by the college.</comment>It is a great class for getting adjusted to the department.</comment>It may feel a little slow at times, but well worth hanging around to get to chat with classmates and the professors</comment>Remember that the Professors come to answer questions that you ask...so ask them!!</comment></course>APMTH 147: Nonlinear Dynamical Systems</title>Important for physicists and engineers alike. I wish we could have gotten to talk about chaos more, and how it shows up in meteorology.</comment>This class is not too flashy. But it is an effective and efficient tool to learn methods of solving and/or approximating nonlinear dynamic systems.</comment>This material of this class is extremely interesting, especially if you like thinking about problems geometrically instead of numerically. Reading the textbook really helps on problem sets and exams, and the textbook is well written.</comment>If you're an applied math major, you'd be better off taking optimization or modeling. This class seems to focus more on physics and engineering majors. Applied math people may find this class quite useless. This class is called 'nonlinear dynamics and chaos.' But we covered linear systems for half the class and touched a little bit on nonlinear systems for the other half. We never even reached the 'chaos' part of the course.</comment>The course material is interesting and not too difficult. Though lectures were a little lackluster and I think we could have covered more material - we didn't get to see too much chaos - overall I was pleased. Avi is very nice and makes himself available for office hours. I do feel like I learned most from the book itself, which is very accessible. Don't expect to learn much matlab. But do expect to see some really useful and interesting concepts that relate to many different fields.</comment>This course was a ton of fun. First, the material itself was very interesting and different than what you normally see in a math class like 21a or 21b. It is very applicable to a wide range of disciplines, so really everyone can benefit from learning it. Second, Avi is an awesome lecturer and teacher. You can tell that he put a lot of effort into preparing for the lectures, which showed in how much detail they contained. He also did little things like sketch graphs in a ton of different colors, which made my notes much more useful when it came time to study. So all in all, great material, great teacher, great textbook--take this class!</comment>AM 147 was a fun class, with material not covered in a lot of other math courses. We didn't get to spend much time on chaos, but the other material was still interesting. Avi is a clear lecturer and very accessible. The workload isn't too intense, but I learned a lot!</comment>Its not as easy as it looks, but do-able. Workload is also moderate - high.</comment>This course material is AMAZING. Seriously, it details such a beautiful way to describe the world around us. Like it's unreal how much I learned from this course. It teaches you how to take insanely difficult problems and analyze their components in rather easy ways. Avi was a fair lecturer. Much better one-on-one.</comment>This class is a good way to fulfill your differential equation requirement for Applied Math if you don't want to take AM 105. The class is fairly reasonable work wise except for the exams, which are tough and don't have any practice materials to help you prepare. The section component of the class is also not great. Avi is a very helpful instructor, though, and is willing to spend a lot of time with students.</comment></course>MATH 124: Number Theory</title>Professor Gross is amazing, and this class was wonderful. Listening to him teach is always great.</comment>This is an excellent course that will not take up too much time, compared to other math courses, but will still give you a solid insight into number theory and some open problems in the field.</comment>A super fun and fairly easy math elective. Prof Gross is awesome, really passionate about the subject and engaged with his students.</comment>A good entry-level course in number theory. Workload is very manageable, and the material is pretty interesting. Gross is also a great professor who wants to see his students succeed!</comment>Dick Gross is an amazing lecturer who generates plenty of enthusiasm</comment>The course is a fair introduction to many topics in number theory.</comment>Number theory is among the most beautiful areas of mathematics</comment>This course has some really neat material. Plus, Professor Gross is a really friendly guy. However, the TFs (which are just random undergrads) really dictate the course. They're the ones that write the homeworks and grade it. And most likely, yours won't be that great. For this iteration of the course, the TFs had some awful homework problems that were less instructive about course material and more just tricky/hard proofs. Plus the TFs never turned back homework (except for the first few). Lastly, I got the impression they just didn't care too much about the course. One time, I went to section and the TF just never showed up. Plus, he never provided an explanation later, despite me emailing him. To make matters worse, one TF was especially reserved when it came to providing assistance with homework. Plus they used language like "this problem is easy" or "this should be obvious" which always is a No-No for teachers. Basically, good material, crappy staff and homework.</comment>Number Theory is one of those classes you take because you legitimately think the subject is beautiful and interesting, and this class does not disappoint in highlighting that. Benedict Gross is the best lecturer I have ever had, the material is fun to play with, and the workload is extremely manageable. Like anything else in the math department, this review is entirely contingent on who is teaching--I would give rave reviews about anything with Professor Gross, but he is a number theorist and therefore particularly effective here.</comment>This was a good class. Gross is a good lecturer, although he tends to rush through material. Take it if you're interested in number theory!</comment>Professor Gross is fantastic. He weaves in the history of mathematics into his lectures and knows the material so well he doesn't even use notes. He covered a bit more material on groups and fields than expected but it was all enjoyable. Highly recommend it.</comment>Fascinating material, not too difficult, not too time consuming. A really solid math elective.</comment>Professor Gross is an awesome teacher and number theory is super interesting. I really liked the way he taught the class this year, keeping the material approachable especially for people who don't necessarily have a strong math background. That said, the organization of the course was pretty poor in some areas, with limited communication about how many midterms there would be and when they would be. Moreover, the TFs failed to return psets in any semblance of a reasonable timeframe, which really hurt my ability to learn from my mistakes. All in all, I would recommend the course because the material is so interesting, but I'd recommend just taking a course with Professor Gross even more.</comment>This is a very interesting course that provides a great survey of topics in number theory that goes far beyond what many have seen at math camps previously.</comment>Great course, although if this year's problem sets are any indication the class will be more demanding than it initially appears.</comment>If you've taken 123 already, consider skipping 124 (and maybe taking 129 instead). That said, Dick Gross is an awesome dude and a good professor, and the class was pretty enjoyable.</comment>This is an excellent choice for someone looking for a mathematics class to take for pleasure. The topics are beautiful and relevant, and the lectures of Prof. Gross's are a pleasure to attend.</comment>although your instruct might say that math 122 isn't necessary, you probably will need it.</comment>The material was great, and Davenport was one of the few math books I actually enjoyed reading. Only complaint would be that I only got back 1 complete pset. I did not get back half of 7 of the psets.</comment></course>GOV 94le: Liberalism and Empire</title>Readings are good</comment>It's a very good class if you're interested in political theory.</comment>This is a really fantastic seminar. Definitely take it if you're interested in looking at political thought through a lens that you would be unlikely to get in general lecture-style courses. The readings are interesting and fairly manageable, and Cheryl Welch is great!</comment></course>PHIL 159s: Skepticism</title>Take this class if you are interested in skepticism or epistemology. It is very interesting and Professor Rinard is a great professor. It is, however, very specific and epistemological in nature, so make sure you know what you're getting into.</comment>Be brave! Take it! This course will test your limits about thinking philosophically and doubting the things that we take so easily for granted. I can see how some people may raise the question, "but why would you doubt that?" but trying to doubt these things is exactly the kind of experience that you should be having at college. This course will show you the expansive intellectual life that you can have, if you're so inclined to doubt.</comment>This class was pretty fun. Professor Rinard is an excellent teacher, and her enthusiasm is great. The class is pretty laid back, the only graded assignments are four papers. The class topic, skepticism, is very interesting, and it turned into a great way to learn about topics in epistemology in general.</comment>This is a great course because it provides an overview of different stances that can really impact other domains of philosophy, and are interesting in and of themselves. Professor Rinard is an enthusiastic teacher and adept at laying out and delving into philosophical arguments with students.</comment></course>SOC-STD 98nw: Health Care in America</title>You will walk away from this course feeling so much more knowledgable about the American health care system, feeling like you could have an informed conversation with someone about the Affordable Care Act, feeling passionate about health care in America, and having definitive opinions about various aspects of health care in America. Not only that but the research methods, namely interviewing, you will learn over the course of doing your project will suit you very well in beginning to think about both a thesis topic and how to conduct your research.</comment>This is one of the best courses that I have taken at Harvard. Completing the final research paper is difficult because it is time consuming; however, it's really rewarding, and I think it will be good preparation for writing a thesis. Professor Macdonald knows everything you could possibly want to know about the US healthcare system, and she really wants everyone to get the most out of the course that they can. She is more than willing to help you if you need it. TAKE THIS COURSE.</comment>Great class! You learn a lot about the healthcare system. That being said, I wouldn't take it unless you are super interested in the U.S. healthcare system and want to write your thesis about it, because then it'll be boring material to you that aren't too exciting unless you just really like learning about the US healthcare system (i.e. Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act). Regardless, the professor was great and you mainly focus on interviewing, so only take this class if you intend on conducting interviews for your thesis.</comment>This is an incredible Social Studies tutorial -- having taken a few, I can say with confidence that this one had some great and very unique strengths. Each week, the material will really "come to life" with great videos that Professor Macdonald has selected (think documentaries that will really pull you into your readings). The focus on the final paper throughout also makes this a great class from a methodology perspective, as you'll learn a lot about how to do interview research for your thesis, even if your topic is unrelated. Overall, this is an exceptionally well organized tutorial and one that I recommend highly despite the fact that I had almost no exposure and little interest in healthcare specifically before taking it!</comment>This is a great junior tutorial with some fascinating content that should be required reading for everyone living in the United States. Professor Macdonald really knows her stuff, and is great at presenting healthcare as a human rights crisis and getting us to feel some of that sense of urgency. From my conversations with other students, it seems like this class was more work than the average junior tutorial (beware of the interviews; setting them up and transcribing them takes a lot longer than you expect). However, I also feel like we got more methodological training than most. The readings and class discussions were very interesting, although it sometimes felt like the class was trying to achieve too much at once (readings, movies, fieldwork, methodological training, discussions, class presentations, response memos, term paper, etc.). The grading is also a bit obscure - we got the assignments back quickly and with helpful feedback, but many students including myself had no idea where we stood in terms of a letter grade until the very end of the semester.. With some caveats in minds, this is a great course in the Social Studies department which I highly recommend if you're interested in healthcare!</comment>Professor Macdonald is an excellent teacher. This is a rigorous and immensely rewarding junior tutorial. You will learn an incredible amount about Health care issues, and will gain valuable practice with qualitative methods like interviewing and observation. This class really prepares you for the senior thesis. TAKE IT if you get the chance!</comment>Take this class if you want to learn to write a thesis doing actual field work. Almost no other course at Harvard will offer you the experience of conducting true, original qualitative research prior to writing a thesis. Also, even if you don't find healthcare riveting, this is a great way to understand one of the most important political, sociological and economic problems of our day. Side note: if you're super conservative (like from the tea party or obsessed with elephants), you'll probably hate the general liberal bias of this course. As a very moderate political person, I didn't mind it and it changed my views on what universal coverage means, and why it is important to have. *changed my views for the better</comment>This class is quite a lot of work, but it is very interesting and I definitely learned a lot</comment>The course is challenging, and the workload (rather, the reading load) is relatively great. Still, in looking back upon the course, I am glad that I took it. I feel more confident with regards to my interviewing practices, and more well-equipped to move forward in conducting research for my senior thesis.</comment></course>APMTH 121: Introduction to Optimization: Models and Methods</title>AM 121 is a well-organized, clearly taught class with interesting material. It is not particularly difficult and all the homework and projects are quite doable. The projects are very interesting and show real life applications of the optimization theory (ours involved treating cancer and solving a telecommunications problem). David Parkes is a nice guy and a good teacher.</comment>AM121 is a challenging but manageable applied math course with interesting material and fair exams and problem sets. The class demands a strong attention to detail and style, particularly in the beginning, but gets easier with time, particularly if you go to sections regularly. The extreme optimization projects will both ruin your weekend. Ultimately though the course is an interesting and applicable overview of optimization.</comment>Really awesome material and new for almost everyone taking it. Definitely not an easy course - but very fair.</comment>This is an amazing class, albeit VERY hard. Although I probably didn't end up with the highest grade, I learned so so so so so much this semester. Parkes is an amazing teacher, his lectures are great (i would recommend skimming lecture notes before lecture so that you're able to follow lecture better). Section handouts = key to doing well in this class! TAKE AM121. you wont be disappointed. best class i've taken at harvard so far.</comment>Interesting and useful topic though lectures not interesting. Sections and section notes are great!</comment>Use the section notes! They are VERY helpful. Avoid section itself; it is not.</comment>The class was pretty meh. I took it because the Q scores were so good but I really wasn't that interested in the material to begin with. I feel like I didn't get that much out of it because I already knew linear programming from cs124 and Markov Chains from stat 110. Other than these two topics most of the course was just memorizing two algorithms: Simplex and Branch-by-bound. Memorizing all the edge cases of complicated algorithms is quite boring and doesn't feel useful because you can just look them up in the real world. I wouldn't take it if you already know linear algebra, linear programming, and Markov Chains.</comment>Learning the tools and concepts in this course is very rewarding. Pay attention to detail on the problem sets and be prepared to dedicate a lot of time and energy to the extreme optimization projects. The course's problem sets are time consuming, especially if you aren't comfortable with AMPL - learn how to use AMPL well as quickly as possible. Overall, an extremely rewarding class full of powerful tools.</comment>Best math course I've taken, not even close</comment>This course is probably one of the better courses in the Applied Math department. I would heavily recommend it for all applied math concentrators. I think that it also helped with learning about basics of math programming. Make sure to start on the project early!</comment>This class is excellent. Not only are the professors for this course excellent, but the material will keep you continually engaged. The concepts are difficult, but there is a lot of support within the course. The projects are very interesting and you will become very good friends with the people that you go through this class with.</comment>This course is very time-consuming and difficult, but highly applicable to a quantitative career. Some basic programming experience and knowledge of Matlab scripts is useful, but expertise in a particular language is not required. Take advantage of office hours early and often and start on the problem sets, especially Extreme Optimization, right away.</comment>AM 121 is a solid course if you want to learn about optimization. The problem sets take a long time and sometimes puzzling but they are not difficult since you can almost always assess whether your answer is right or wrong. David Parkes did a great job teaching the course; the guest lectures were not as great as regular lectures. Lecture notes are very thorough and section notes must be read.</comment>buy the book</comment>This course was not as much work as people made it seem. It was taught basically entirely by Professor Parkes, who is an excellent lecturer. The class is graded fairly, and the section/lecture notes are more than enough to get you through the problem sets. You should be familiar with latex, but the coding and actual math in this class are not terrible to deal with.</comment>Professor Parkes is amazing!</comment>The class is very interesting and not that difficult if you put in the time.</comment>AM 121 is a good class. The material isn't the most interesting ever, but it's presented in a clear and easy to understand way and you learn a lot. It's pretty cool to see how you can model problems and to see just how many interesting problems you can model with just Linear Programming. All of the problem sets and projects and assessments work together really well to make it so that you get a lot out of the material. All in all, I thought it was a well-organized, solid class - not the most amazing stellar class ever, but definitely nothing much to complain about either.</comment>good class! learn a decent amount and not too difficult.</comment></comment>This course is awesome! The applications are super interesting. There is a programming component to many of the assignments, but the language used, AMPL, is tailored to be used for the use cases of the course (namely, to solve linear programs).  Take this course!</comment>This is by far the best class I have taken at Harvard. It is well worth all the work as the material is extremely rewarding, interesting, and applicable to real-word situations.</comment>Class is very useful material and Professor Parkes genuinely cares about all of his students. One thing I didn't like about the class is that it almost encourages you to just understand how to use specific tools and techniques, like a high school math class, rather than learn "why" they work.</comment>This class is super well-structured. Parkes is a fantastic lecturer. It does take a lot of time though. You'll learn a lot too.</comment>AM121 is one of the best classes I've taken at Harvard. Even though this semester's course was taught by Professor Parkes, he was amazing. The section material and the problem sets are extremely interesting, and the extreme optimization projects were really fun. I took this class out of interest, not for concentration requirements, and it was the most enjoyable class I had this semester. I learned a TON, and am looking for more classes to take on linear programming now.</comment>This is just a great class in every sense. It's organized and has a reasonable work load, introduces you to a great field (optimization), and the teaching staff is great. No reason not to take it, especially for Applied Math concentrators. If you've taken linear algebra (maybe even if not) and are looking for an interesting elective, take this.</comment>This was a pretty well organized AM class. Having CS50 (or prior coding experience) and Stat 110 (or familiarity with basic RVs and expectation) is very helpful, but not necessary. The course demands some time outside of the class (expect 7-10 hours per pset, and 10-15 hours per extreme optimization, of which there are 2). But not having a final exam (just two midterms) is very nice (and the second midterm isn't even cumulative!). The course isn't overwhelming in terms of concepts or workload, and is somewhat specialized, but it teaches a way of thinking and is a good exercise in problem solving!</comment>Probably the best applied math I have taken at Harvard, if you are an AM major you should 100% take this course. Hard work but not impossible, fun extreme optimization group challenges, interesting real world applications. The hardest part is becoming comfortable with AMPL, but once you are, the problem sets get considerably easier.</comment>This course3 is probably the best in the applied math department.  That being said, it is also a pretty good computer science class (which it counts for).  The professor is really good and the materials are thorough as well.  Get started on EO2 EARLY!!</comment>This is an incredible course if you're at all interested in modeling problems such as Airline Scheduling (general allocation of resources). It's well-taught and accessible, but can be difficult at times.</comment>I LOVED this class. If you have reservations, you should still take it. Optimization is actually pretty darn awesome and Parkes is a superstar.</comment>a</comment>Take it if Yiling comes back. Her reviews were great. Until then, I don't recommend.
The subject is incredibly interesting. I was wow'ed by the breadth of applications for linear optimization at the beginning. But the course was not the same without Yiling. This semester, problem sets, especially the team extreme optimization problem sets, were huge time sinks. Lectures were largely unhelpful for completing problem sets, and TFs in section usually rushed through material in an effort to get though the huge section packets. It all felt disorganized because no one there had taught the class before.</comment>This is a phenomenal Harvard course. It is difficult and time-consuming, but well worth the effort. It is impeccably organized, and there are tons of resources available if you get stuck. The course material in engaging.</comment>One of the most applicable applies math classes I've taken. Some of the homework problems can be tedious though, and I wish there had been more explanation/intuition provided for the linear algebra equations they often showed us.

Overall a useful class though if you want to learn how to model linear programs and what to do when those programs get big (100s or 1000s of variables).</comment>This is one of the few classes that you immediately feel is applicable in real world problems, and you learn how to model many real world problems. The course itself is not difficult but the assignments can be long at times. Professor Parkes is a really great lecturer and the teaching staff was very helpful.</comment>A very interesting course. Good way to fulfill an Applied Math requirement. Decent amount of work though.</comment>You come away from the class with a lot of powerful knowledge and tools at your disposal. But be warned that lectures were pretty dull and most learned most of the material at sections / office hours / on own.</comment>This class is really interesting, but can be disorganized at times. It's also fairly time-consuming, so be sure to allot appropriate time to do the problem sets.</comment></course>AFRAMER 209a: Africa Rising? New African Economies/Cultures and Their Global Implications</title>If you have any interest in Africa, you should definitely take this course. The readings and visiting professors are incredible, and Jean and John are phenomenal.</comment>Taking a course with Jean and John Comaroff is a magical experience. They are brilliant and incredibly invested in students' thoughts.</comment>Its light on reading, you must consider this if you are not into reading a lot of stuff</comment>Great class. Not what the title implies, but you will learn a ton.</comment>Carpe Diem!</comment>TAKE THIS CLASS. You learn so much from this class, without putting in tons of work. Just come having read (it's a reasonable amount) and prepared to learn and share, really incredible course.</comment>I loved this course, and the Comaroffs are clearly very passionate about the material they teach! It's a very cool way to learn about new research that's happening in the field, and get to interact with professionals who are writing and doing this work!</comment>You will learn a ton from the Comaroffs. They are absolutely brilliant and supportive professors and it has been a privilege to take a course with them!</comment>Take the course if you have not taken a course with the Comaroff's yet. They are some of the best professors Harvard has. However, the readings are not always that great and the discussion component of the course is dependent on who is taking the course. Take it for the professor's. The content needs to be worked on.</comment>The Professors are amazing and the material is fascinating</comment>This is a great class to take if you're interested in African Studies regardless of your disciplinary bend since papers ranged from anthro, to history, to lit, econ, urban studies etc. 
Its also great if you're interested in seeing how a paper gets workshopped in an academic context. Not only were the contributions from both noon and evening sessions immensely interesting, it was also great to see the author in person discuss what their process and intention was as they wrote.
Added to all that, its very manageable workload. Definitely recommend!</comment></course>FRSEMR 36z: Monstrous Literature</title>It needs more time than a Freshman Seminar should because of the readings. However, it is also possible to get away with not doing the readings - but then you won't get as much from the course as you should.</comment>Very manageable yet interesting class to take. The readings are very well chosen.</comment>If you are seriously interested in the general subject of this course and enjoy close reading passages, then I recommend that you consider enrolling in this seminar. Though some of the books can be a bit dense (Spenser comes to mind), the works as a whole are fascinating. The course falls into a nice rhythm, consisting primarily of weekly blog responses and class discussions. If you're worried that some of the texts look inaccessible, know that you will be provided will helpful reading notes written by the instructor.   Some warnings: don't take this course if you do not think that you will be able to keep up with the reading. While you may be able to get by, the classroom discussions will not be nearly as enlightening. The reading pace was quite fast for a seminar (one book a week), so make sure you don't start the reading the night before.  Don't let the daunting length of the essays discourage you from taking the course. There is a lot of help available, and if you start early then you will have more than enough time to get the work done. Again, as long as you're interested in the subject (the course title got you excited), you don't have anything to worry about.</comment>The course is very enjoyable. Be prepared to do a lot of course readings and blogs.</comment>Exploring the nature of monstrosity and human nature through literature in this seminar is interesting and worthwhile. Not only will you have the opportunity to read a wide variety of notable texts and plays, but you'll have the chance to learn more about our own society as well.</comment>I loved Monstrous Literature! As a prospective Social Sciences concentrator interested in morality and infatuated with books, this course satiated my literary appetite while also making me grapple with philosophical questions that are pertinent to governance: Who determines what is good and evil? Is "monstrosity" contingent upon history?</comment>It is a lot of reading, but the books are good and the discussions are very interesting and worthwhile.</comment></course>HIST-LIT 90bc: We the Readers: Reading Communities in Early America</title>Even if this course doesn't fall squarely within your area of interest, Jenni renders material interesting and relevant.</comment>Although a colonial literature course can seem boring or daunting, this class is actually relatable and insightful in many ways and engages with themes that extend beyond the colonial period. The primary sources can sometimes be hard to get through, but the secondary readings are really interesting. The assignments are flexible, definitely doable, and if you're interested in the material (and you probably will be, surprisingly) fun to write. Most of all, Jenni Brady is a great seminar leader who really helped bring some of these texts to life. I'd definitely recommend this class, especially if you're thinking Hist & Lit or trying to fulfill the colonial lit requirement for Hist & Lit.</comment>You really will leave this class with a heightened awareness of how much meaning we assign as a culture to literacy / reading / certain kinds of reading and how those meanings shift over time. You will read some really interesting texts you otherwise are unlikely to have exposure to (e.g. letters written by Native Americans during colonial period, first American play, etc.)</comment>Take any class offered by Jenni Brady. She is absolutely dynamite. Best advisor, teacher, critic I have had at Harvard.</comment>This is a challenging HL90. The readings are diverse and interesting, and of course the discussion depends on the people in the class. But you should take this seminar because Jenni Brady is an absolutely incredible instructor. She will push you to write, think, and speak more effectively. She is always available to talk about ideas for your next paper or your thoughts on the week's readings, and you'll leave meetings with Jenni with the feeling that a professor genuinely cares about you and your intellectualism. That's a rare thing here. People like Jenni Brady are few and far between, and if you get the chance to take a class with a tutor as extraordinary as her, you should absolutely take it.</comment>Though it is reading heavy, and you will have writing to do every week as well, a really interesting and broad span of issues is covered in the seminar. We discussed everything from early American publishing to female reading to Native American literacy and urban studies in-depth, which was really refreshing.</comment>this class will totally change your idea about what it means to read. Jenni is such a sweetie and a really fantastic lecturer and feedback-giver. She has constructed an ingenious syllabus full of really fascinating stuff with also really interesting assignments. Highly recommend.</comment>This is a great class if you are ready to spend the time and get the most out of it. The instructor was great at guiding discussions and helping students develop writing. The assignments were manageable but still significant work.</comment>This is a very strong HL90 seminar. The literature is engaging and interesting, and Dr. Brady is an excellent teacher who is committed to ensuring that her students improve. She facilitates in class discussion really well and has an articulate way of phrasing complicated concepts that make them seem much more clear. Be aware, however, that the workload in this class is exceedingly heavy. There are between 150 - 300 pages of reading a week, in addition to five total writing assignments. Grading is also very tough, and good written assignments require somewhere between 5 - 15 hours of work.</comment>This class will improve you as a reader and as a writer; Jenni will ask a lot of you and get you there. She represents and creates the best of Hist&Lit: rigorous reading and writing, very personalized attention, and lively discussion.</comment>Jenni's course was a fantastic HL90 course to fulfill the colonial literature requirements. Jenni is a marvelous teacher who is incredibly smart and passionate about the subject matter. She provides great feedback on papers that encourages us to think more critically and analytically about the course material. I feel really lucky to have had the opportunity to learn from her!</comment>This is a great course to take if you're looking to have discussions with a lot of fellow Hist and Lit'ers.I found the discussion very stimulating and Jenni's knowledge of the time periods we discussed was very impressive.</comment></course>HAA 271p: Reading, Drawing, Printing Architecture : Seminar</title>rare opportunity to access university collections</comment>A great small class with Alina as a great professor. It is a one in a million class by being able to go to Houghton and look at amazing books from the 15th and 16th centuries.</comment>Nor is the history of architecture to be exclusively identified with buildings, but also with books, writings and drawings, capable of developing and communicating architectural ideas. If you love books, history and architecture, it is a very appropiate course.</comment></course>MATH 122: Algebra I: Theory of Groups and Vector Spaces</title>Hiro was fantastic. Go to lecture and keep up with the concepts. Have fun with this class!</comment>Abstract algebra is a beautiful subject and with Hiro, this was a fantastic course. Unfortunately, the math department moves faculty around so much that it's hard to say what it will be like in someone else's hands.</comment>This class was well taught and clearly explained. Hiro is a very enthusiastic lecturer and I highly recommend any class he teaches. The material of the class is very interesting, psets are insightful, and exams are fair. Overall, a really great class.</comment>Challenging (especially at the end), but rewarding if you put the work in. With Tanaka, it was a very well taught, moderately difficult course that I think would be perfect for those on the fence about studying mathematics.</comment>Hiro is awesome and this class was really interesting. A must-take class for anyone interested in mathematics.</comment>This is an essential class for any math major, so you'll probably have to take it. Hiro was great and made the material very accessible and intuitive. It was a bit easy at times, especially the first half of the course, but it picked up pace towards the end of the semester.</comment>Hiro is the best math teacher I've had at Harvard. He's funny and approachable, and clearly cares about all his students. He focuses on making the material make sense in a broader mathematical context, and sometimes even makes it seem fun! This is coming from a senior CS/Math concentrator who dropped this class twice in previous years because it was too dry/difficult/boring. Group theory is important and you should probably take it, but you'll have a lot more fun if you take it with Hiro.</comment>If Hiro ever teaches the class again, be sure to take it.  If you're interested in math, you'll have to take it anyways, but it's a very insightful course nonetheless.</comment>Take the class with Hiro if you can! He's a great teacher and the material is very approachable.</comment>122 is totally necessary if you want to concentrate in math. If Hiro is teaching it, don't pass it up.</comment>An interesting, well-paced course. Tanaka gives great lectures, and respects the fact that students have other courses as well, so the workload is not too heavy. Definitely take it if he teaches it again!</comment>Hiro Tanaka is an amazing lecturer. I have never had a course in which the lectures were so brilliantly clear and accessible while also covering truly deep and interesting material. From day one, it was exceedingly clear how much care had been put into the development of lectures and homework. I think frequently 100-level math courses get pushed in speed by stronger students, but this course felt universally accessible, even though we were covering some pretty abstract topics. In short, this is a course where going to lecture is so worth it, not because there is a dearth in notes (the lecture notes are top-notch!), but because Hiro is so great at presenting topics in a straightforward manner (and his in-class antics are pretty amusing). I am so glad to have taken this course, and would recommend anyone considering it to take it if Hiro Tanaka is teaching.</comment>The material was not too interesting to me -- proofs were not really elegant; they were just tedious. I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to see if pure math is a good fit for them.</comment>This class was wonderful! I came out of Math 23 and had a lot less proof experience than most of my classmates, but I still felt like I was able to keep up and learn a lot without falling behind. The class builds a solid foundation for algebra and group/ring theory from scratch. The workload was substantial, but the proofs on the problem sets were interesting and stimulating, so the psets weren't too annoying. Hiro is a great lecturer with a passion for teaching, and I thought he did an excellent job of breaking down difficult concepts and proofs. (However, note that different instructors seem to differ a lot in how they conduct this course. For instance, if you compare Hiro's lecture notes with Dennis Gaitsgory's notes from Math 122 in 2012, there's a lot that was covered this year that wasn't covered in 2012, and vice versa.) There's no real knowledge prerequisite for the class; you just need some comfort with mathematical notation/lingo and with writing/understanding proofs. If you have those, you'll be fine in the class.</comment>HIro is the best!  Enjoy the ride.</comment>Hiro is a really awesome teacher - he's extremely clear and engaging, and the class as a whole was a very systematic and insightful introduction to group theory. The lectures, assignments and tests were all carefully designed to complement each other excellently and contribute to your understanding of the subject matter.</comment>As with most classes in the math department, your experience depends greatly on the teacher. Hiro was an excellent teacher. He is phenomenal at exposition, and he constantly worked hard for the sake of his students. Material-wise, this class just a standard introduction to groups, and abstract algebra more generally. A portion of this class is devoted to linear algebra, so if you took 25 that part should be a breeze; the difficulty of the rest, again, is dependent on who's teaching it.</comment>I recommend this class if Tanaka is teaching it again - this course is very dependent on the instructor.</comment>I took this class two years after taking Math 23, and hadn't taken any proof-based math classes in the interim, so my mathematical skills were a bit rusty. That being said, most of the students in this class have Math 23 or 25 pretty fresh in their minds (and were definitely in the top portions of those classes). If you're a little rusty, it would be a good idea to look at Artin or another algebra textbook to back in the swing of things. That being said, Hiro is a good lecturer and a really cool guy. A component of the grade is talking with Hiro or a TF about significant mistakes made on problem sets and tests which might be annoying, but it forced me to go in and make sure I was understanding the concept.</comment>This is a great class where you learn a ton.  Definitely a necessary and great class for math concentrators.  Covers super important and interesting material.  For non math concentrators, it is an interesting class but definitely challenging.</comment>This class has a bad reputation from previous years, but Hiro makes it awesome! Absolutely take this course if he's still teaching it.</comment>Take any class taught by Hiro. He has an unparalleled vibe and is a very sensitive and charismatic teacher. As for this class - you're probably going to take it this semester regardless of who is teaching it (if you're a math person), so enjoy.</comment>This class was a really solid introduction to the world of real math! I shopped this class on a whim and took it because Hiro is just a great lecturer who explained the material clearly. You will legitimately enjoy going to class. Algebra is hard, and Hiro's explanations and sequential presentation of the information were what made it manageable. Be warned that it's not an easy class - the concepts are difficult if you haven't seen them before (like I hadn't). Testing is fair. Take this class if you're ready for the challenge and have the time to devote to thinking about math.</comment>Do take the course if Hiro is teaching! He is one of the funniest professors in the math department but nonetheless is still able to keep the class very informative and engaging. Even if he isn't teaching, the class is still very useful for your future math endeavors.</comment>I shopped 122 last year for 5 weeks and ultimately dropped it because the lectures were impossible to follow. I enrolled again this year and the course was completely different thanks to Hiro. He definitely ranks among the best professors I've had at Harvard. I never felt like the material was difficult just for the sake of difficulty, and I really enjoyed lectures.</comment>This course is amazing when taught by Tanaka! I've heard it depends highly on who's teaching it, but if it's Tanaka, definitely take it. I would say he's literally the best instructor I've ever had. He is always accessible, he's extremely clear, he always posts lecture notes, and at the same time he's really funny and generates enthusiasm for the subject matter. My one regret was not going to more office hours and getting to know him more! The problem sets are pretty easy (especially if you're coming from Math 25--Math 23 is probably enough of a background for this course), yet at the same time are interesting and get you to learn and discover things on your own. The one qualm I have is that some "extra problems" were not for extra credit yet some were, and it was not always very clear which were which--regardless, though, all of these problems were interesting and nice to tackle. It's not a big time commitment, and definitely a great class to take (plus, if you're a math major it's pretty much a requirement anyway). Math 25 left a bad taste in my mouth when it came to mathematics, but Math 122 has made me love it more than ever. Take it, take it, take it!</comment>I am not sure whether Hiro will be teaching this course next year, but he is absolutely wonderful and you should take anything he teaches! And go to his office hours if you have any confusions.</comment>solid class, learned a lot about theoretical computer science with hiro</comment>If you didn't take Math 55, you should take this class, since abstract algebra is a cornerstone of modern mathematics. Depending on who teaches this class, it will be a completely different experience, so it is hard to make any general statements, but if Hiro is teaching again, definitely take it at that time.</comment>If Hiro is lecturing, take it! It's a very accessible class for people with absolutely no knowledge of abstract algebra, and coming from 23, I felt relatively prepared but not as prepared as people more comfortable with abstract/theoretical mathematics (i.e. those from 25). I liked the challenge though, and Hiro definitely makes it doable for anyone, even those with minimal knowledge of proofs.  Also, if Kevin is a TF, he's the best!</comment>The material in 122 is foundational mathematical knowledge and so you should take this course if you want or need that knowledge, or if you're looking for an accessible introduction to the sort of abstract things mathematicians study beyond linear algebra. It's for the most part very elegant, and some of the results have astonishing structure (e.g. Sylow theorems). That said, experience in this course seems totally instructor-dependent. Everyone I know who took it in 2013 hated it because the instruction was horrible, whereas everyone I know who took it this year (2014) liked it. Hiro is nearly universally adored. He's a charismatic and well-organized lecturer, invested significant thought and time into the course, and was very accessible outside of class. It's difficult not to love a professor who reads aloud long, meditative Grothendieck quotations and brings giant bungee cords to class to demonstrate the fundamental group. Hiro thinks and cares about how students engage with math, and it shows.</comment>This class varies a lot from year to year depending on who teaches, so read through more than one year's Q responses to get a better idea of what the class may be like. Hiro Tanaka was a great professor who made lectures understandable (and occasionally funny). It is helpful to have a strong linear algebra background (such as 25a) since a lot of the material overlaps with 25a but is taught in a more illuminating way using modules and rings rather than vector spaces.</comment>Definitely take this class if Hiro is teaching it again! He's a wonderful professor and cares a lot about making sure all of his students understand the subject material.</comment>This class was fantastic!  Hiro was a great instructor, and the course material was very interesting.  I would recommend this course to anyone interested in math and physics.</comment>Hiro made this course. Seize any opportunity to take a class with him. He provides examples and motivation with his proofs and is an entertaining lecturer. I also think this version of the course was easy enough to be accessible even if you're not a math concentrator.</comment>Abstract algebra is an interesting subject, and I feel like what I learned in Math 122 is useful in many other areas. I can't recommend Hiro's teaching highly enough; not only did he give great lectures, he clearly put a huge amount of effort into organizing the course to maximize every student's ability to learn.</comment>Hiro is fantastic. It is entirely possible that any course he is teaching is worth taking just because of that. He certainly succeeded in making the topic very engaging. It is probably also possible to give this course in a very dull way, but as long as it has a good teacher, it is well worth taking.</comment>This is a harder question for math courses, since it doesn't look like anyone teaches the same class twice. Nevertheless, Hiro is a fantastic lecturer and a very fair grader. He has a good sense of what's difficult and generally does a good job of pacing the class accordingly. Be aware that the pace does pick up after the first midterm, and while it's quite easy to coast on the early material, the later stuff will require more earnest engagement.</comment>This course was very well taught and a great introduction to group/ring theory. A proof based background is necessary and the class will take some work, especially in the beginning if you have never seen a group before.</comment>I would definitely recommend this class if Hiro Tanaka is teaching it.  He’s very funny and is better at explaining new concepts than any math professor I’ve had before.</comment>If Hiro teaches it again, you should definitely take it.</comment>Not sure if Hiro is teaching next year, but he's great! He makes an effort to build up intuition and is very sincere. The HW assignments are enjoyable and doable (and really help you learn the material), and the midterms were also doable. The final was very hard though, despite the EC!</comment>This course varies with professor. This semester, Prof. Tanaka (Hiro) taught it.
Hiro is an excellent lecturer. The material was really clear, and the learning was not too difficult (the psets for the first half were incredibly easy; the second half were a bit trickier but definitely not time consuming for a math course). Definitely go to lecture, they're really clear and he's hilarious.
If you're interested in abstract math you'll definitely want to take this at some point, it's fundamental (puns) for a lot of other math and physics. That also means it's really interesting if you've already seen some of those applications, so that's a plus.</comment></course>PHIL 19: Introduction to Philosophy of Religion</title>This class was wonderful. The material is fascinating. The professor was great and so was Patricia (the TF). They both are happy to discuss your paper or philosophy in general. No complaints. Anyone who takes this course should also see the Departmental Writing Fellow for any extra help. I saw him a few times throughout the semester and I found he gave helpful advice. If you have any interest in arguments for God's existence, arguments concerning the divine attributes (omnipotence, omniscience, etc.), or are searching for an introduction to the department I found this to be a solid course.</comment>This is a great class to take if you want an introductory course on philosophy. The lectures are interesting and easy to keep up with, the papers will help you solidify your knowledge of the material and allow you to craft your own arguments, and the overall workload is light and very manageable. You also get so much out of this class as an intellectual- it will keep you thinking long after the lecture ends. This was one of my favorite classes and I highly recommend it to future students!</comment>The readings can sometimes be a bit difficult and some of them are loner than others, but i think the class is definitely worth taking. i was by far my favorite class and i'm now considering a phil secondary instead of an English secondary after taking it (probably going to choose phil)</comment>This class was fantastic! The teaching staff was awesome, the workload was low, and I really enjoyed learning the material. Take this class!</comment>I think It's a great introduction to philosophy!</comment>Good readings, lectures, discussions, and paper assignments.</comment>A great course.  Strong lectures and section.  The course addresses really interesting philosophical issues related to religion.  If you are interested in that, it is a must-take.</comment>Since I got into Harvard I knew I wanted to take this class. The topic is so interesting that makes you read more literature about it. The workload is not so much- I only spent about 30 min to one hour before each lecture to prepare the article that will be discussed. Writing papers is the main thing. One paper monthly. By the time you have to write your paper you more or less know where the topic and lecture goes to, so it is not very difficult to find a thesis for a given prompt. There is a lot of help if you have never written a paper. The writing center, the philosophy writing center, and the TF is always able and willingly to provide any feedback if you send her a draft, or even meeting with you at a certain time. If you feel it's too much, it's ok. They do grant extensions, and you can work with your TF on your paper. This was the best class I took my freshman fall, the class that made me wake up to go to lectures and sections every week. Even when it does not count towards the philosophy concentration, at least consider taking it if you want to have a smooth transition to more advanced writing courses. After this class I am definitely considering a concentration/secondary field in Philosophy. You don't need a study group for this class. If you read through the articles and arrive prepared for class, you'll be fine.</comment>It's an easy class, but don't take it for that reason. Take it if you want to experiment with religion or philosophy otherwise you will probably be incredibly bored.</comment>This is an interesting class if you want a broad approach to theology or to "get your toes wet" in philosophy. It is not a huge time commitment but don't think you aren't learning. I have found it very useful in terms of being a well-rounded human.</comment></course>OEB 50: Genetics and Genomics</title>You need ls1b to understand anything they are talking about. This was not a repeat of ls1b in any way shape or form like older Q guides indicate. On another note, the professors are super nice and understanding.</comment>It's a great interesting course.</comment>If you are interested in genetics and genomics, especially after taking LS1b, then this course will give you a lot of great information on the topic. It is not a stressful course when it comes to workload, which allows students to engage with and grasp the material (which is pretty difficult).</comment>This class is fantastic if you do it the right way. What I mean by this is don't expect much if anything out of section: it's disorganized and irrelevant. What you need to do is be willing to show up to every lecture, ask questions, and make time to meet with the professors. Professor Bomblies was the sole reason I understood this class, and understood it very well. The material is difficult but super rewarding, you just have to be willing to work for it and go to the right places (ie the professors) for help and guidance. I'm glad I took the course for sure, but just know that going in. It is NOT a repeat of LS1b.</comment>Taking this course was not a painful experience, but I can't say that it inspired or changed me significantly. Some of the genetics problem-solving is sort of fun, and the professors are extremely kind and passionate, but the lectures are pretty tough to sit through. Students who are extremely interested in/passionate about genetics who think they can stay engaged in the material should definitely take this course, but if that doesn't apply to you, you will end up totally checking out during lecture and gain very little from the experience.</comment>This course is designed for students with an interest in genetics. The problem sets and exams are fairly straightforward. The lectures are interesting and both the professors and TF's were very helpful. This is definitely one of the best OEB midlevel courses!!</comment>OEB50 is a must-take class for students wishing to pursue fields in genetics. It is an amazing introduction and in-depth overview of key mechanisms and concepts in genetics. The class is taught in a small, lecture style; professor Hartl's and professor Bomblies' old-school chalk-talk type of lectures is refreshing and makes lessons more interactive and accessible to all students. You definitely need a good background in basic molecular biology and statistics</comment>the teaching staff is not very in tune with itself, and it's difficult to get answers to many questions.</comment>The material in this course is difficult, but the teaching staff is really wonderful and the Professors make the class seem like a personalized experience.  You not only get lectures, but you get conversations on current implications, discussions over the epistemology of genetics, and hands-on learning with models.  I feel like I have a very good grasp of genetics afar taking this course, although I came in with no background.  I'd definitely recommend it if you are just interested in genetics.</comment>take this class. Great way to fill a midlevel. Also no final!</comment>The professors mentioned this towards the end of the class, but only take this course if you're really interested in genetics (esp if you have a choice in taking it). With enough effort, the course isn't actually that difficult, but lecture and section can occasionally be confusing and all-over the place. In a somewhat weird way, I thought Ben and Holly were better at explaining specific problems in one on one settings as opposed to during section or office hours before an exam. Problem sets also require you to look at them a few days in advance to be able to actually find the concepts needed and do them in advance. The practice problems were also probably helpful and I should have done more of them before lecture</comment>Wonderful course, great subject matter. Professor Bomblies and Professor Hartl are fantastic.</comment>It is a really interesting the class and the professors only want you to succeed and learn something about genetics and genomics.</comment>Interest/passion for genetics is a MUST. Do NOT just take this to fill a requirement.</comment></course>GOV 94ca: Casino Capitalism: Gambling, finance, and the ethics of speculation</title>By far the most thought-provoking class I've taken at Harvard. Prof. Sandel is incredible, and really lets the class run itself. You'll question a lot of things you previously took as truth, but you'll be a better person for it.</comment>This is the ultimate Harvard course. The kind of college class you thought you would be taking all of the time back when you were a high schooler thinking about Harvard. Just getting to know such an amazing/legendary professor is pretty cool; to be able to engage with Professor Sandel and thoughtful classmates on difficult subjects took this course a step further. This seminar was certainly one of my favorite classes at Harvard.</comment>This course and the moral debate it incites will change the way you see the world in a way you would never have imagined.</comment>This was easily one of the best courses I have taken at Harvard, and I urge you take any opportunity you can to learn from Professor Sandel. I would often leave this class mentally exhausted, because each seminar was so challenging and engaging. The subject is certainly something that deserves more attention here at Harvard. Professor Sandel is as kind as he is intelligent, and he is truly what makes this class so special.</comment>Best class I have ever taken at Harvard. Period.</comment>This class is fantastic. Each class is two hours of discussion and debate that will challenge your intuitions and put your beliefs to the test.</comment></course>EGYPTIAN Aa: The Language of the Pharaohs: Introduction to Egyptian hieroglyphs I</title>This is an incredibly fun class if you're interested in actually learning the language! Professor Der Manuelian is amazing! He is incredibly interested and knowledgeable about the material and does a good job breaking up class by going on tangents and giving a bit more of the Ancient Egyptian history and culture. This is not really a course to learn about Ancient Egypt (which is what I was looking for - try Societies in the World 38), but it was much more interesting than I had initially anticipated. Also, if you are debating between taking this P/F or for a letter grade, take it for a letter grade - Prof. Der Manuelian makes all of the material very accessible to everyone in the class from all different backgrounds. Plus he is a really lenient grader.</comment>This class provides the opportunity to learn from a leading professor in his field, and in a small tutorial environment. If you have any interest in learning about ancient egyptian culture- take this class! Very reasonable workload and interesting material- its kind of like solving puzzles!</comment>This is a great class. Really different material.</comment>This course is amazing. The professor is extremely nice and ludicrously knowledgeable about Ancient Egypt. Sometimes half the class time would be taken up by going off on tangents about various aspects of Egyptian history and culture, but these were fascinating and informative, and were a testament to how efficiently Professor der Manuelian got us through the material. Not particularly difficult either, I regret taking it pass/fail, but not an easy A: you need to stay caught up in the material and practice outside of class and homework to do well, but if you're as obsessed with Egypt as I am, then it barely feels like work.</comment>This is a fantastic class. The professor is fun, engaging and kind, and will help you when you're struggling with the material. The asides he gives are very interesting. Take this class if you have any interest in foreign languages or Egypt.</comment>This is the coolest class I have taken this semester</comment>great class. take it and you will learn a lot, being able to walk into a museum and read 5,000 year old sentences right off the wall.</comment>excellent if you want to enjoy taking a different language and learning something you will never have another opportunity to study</comment></course>HISTSCI 209: Science, Religion and Culture: Debates, Methods and Controversies</title>Just do the readings, do your research, and have fun when it comes time to discuss.</comment>Prof Ragab is awesome. His approach to the discourse is a great model for scholarship, in particular, for those whose interests are both deep and wide. His theoretical intervention is also timely and I would recommend it wholeheartedly for any student looking to think more capaciously about things like "knowledge," "the academy" and "society" and the various interstructuring relationships among them.</comment>Excellent material, but Prof. Ragab is what makes this course worth taking!</comment>Fantastic instructor; recommend this course highly.</comment></course>MUSIC Bhf: Exercises in Tonal Writing and Analysis</title>For composers is a bit of a waste of time</comment>A good way to beef up your theory knowledge for generals, especially in areas not commonly covered, like Renaissance music.</comment>It's structured very nicely and Osnat is a great teacher.</comment></course>VES 166: North American Seacoasts and Landscapes, Discovery to Present: Seminar</title>The most enjoyable and unconventionally rewarding class I've taken here-- it's is very applicable to life in unexpected ways. The course is self-selecting, and you have to be very open minded and like the idea of unprogrammed learning.</comment>This course is a wild ride. Anything goes, just be willing to follow any train of thought. It really pushes you to think both creatively and analytically. Every comment is appreciated and nothing is off limits. You'll come away with an understanding of what the seacoast means to people.</comment></course>SPANSH 109: Displacing Spain: Workshop on 20th and 21st-Century Transatlantic Poetry</title>Take this class! Thinking about translation provided a unique and interesting lens to take a different look at some amazing poets. Dr. Aguirre Oteiza is a great lecturer and does a fantastic job of promoting very wide ranging discussions of poetry, art, history, and philosophy</comment>This class is the best class that I have taken at Harvard. I was actually sad to miss it the two times I did when I was sick. It is engaging and enthralling and interesting. Daniel is an amazing professor and probably one of the best I've ever had. Definitely take this class!</comment>AMAZING - take the class.</comment>This is the most fun I have ever had studying poetry. However, you can't just study poetry without also learning about the poets, about their lives, their trials. The 20th century was a very interesting and turbulent one, and produced many authors and poets who have written amazing works. We looked studied the movements, the wars, and revolutions that sparked change throughout the Western society and applied that to our readings.</comment>What an awesome class! This course does not inundate you with reading, leaving you free to really interact with the poems and poets we study. The broad range of poets the course covers really ensures that you have a working knowledge of the field, and the relationships between poets and their work is brought to life in a fascinating manner by Daniel, who is certainly the most engaging language teacher I have ever had the pleasure to take a course with.</comment>Even if you don't typically enjoy poetry, this class furnishes a strong appreciation for it as a social and historical force. In this class, you not only analyze poems for their grammar, meter and rhyme, you analyze their importance in a historical context. A well-rounded course to say the least.</comment>I have not had a teacher at Harvard that takes his/her course material and its presentation as seriously and personally as Daniel. He is just a phenomenal teacher, which is more than I can say for any class involving a lecture, and most others as well.</comment></course>HEB 1329: Sex, Love and War: The Evolution of Human Behavior</title>Extremely interesting material. Highly recommended class. Very manageable workload. Awesome professors (go to office hours for sure).</comment>I would recommend this class to a student who is willing to work in an elective class (with dense readings) or to a student who wants to explore HEB. For me, I ended up realizing that I didn't love HEB, but I did overall enjoy this class, and especially Professor Wrangham's lectures! It's not a ton of work, but if you're just taking it without any interest in the subject matter, you probably will lose motivation to do the work.</comment>This class made me so excited to be an HEB concentrator. So many cool topics, two professors I'm really glad I know, and a great introduction to the study of human behavior. If you're wondering about HEB, this is an awesome class to take.</comment>Overall this is a good course, but it's harder than I expected. It's also a lot of memorizing before the midterm and final- a ton of info. Given that it's a survey course that supposed to help you figure out if you like HEB, I found it not as exciting as I'd hoped, but if you're interested in HEB I'd still take it. Also, the material is very interesting, and you will start analyzing your own life with a new lens.</comment>This course has really interesting material that makes up a lot of the fundamentals of HEB. However, the class itself is not as engaging as one would hope. I think it might be because it aims to cover way too much material within short classes and each class, while interesting, can easily be glossed from realizing the larger topic and purpose (after all "the evolution of human behavior" is as broad as it can get).</comment>I would say the course material is great and the teaching staff is enthusiastic, but the tests can be a little tricky.</comment>This course isn't very relevant to everyday life. You will learn a ton of HBE facts and theories about why we do things the way we do (really interesting - about sex, love, war, conflict, reconciliation, parenting, etc) but not a ton about how and why that matters to any societies we live in. Exams are fairly straightforward if you can memorize the slides, but do expect some brute memorization. Really enjoyed other assignments and section is amazing!</comment>The class is interesting but very disorganized which makes studying hard. I don't like how it encouraged rote memorization instead of learning big concepts.</comment>If you are at all considering concentrating in HEB, take this course. The curriculum is extremely interesting, and Professors Hinde and Wrangham are fantastic lecturers. There is also not a lot of work throughout the semester, although studying for the midterm and final was a bit difficult. There was so much information condensed into each lecture that it was difficult to figure out what to focus on the most.</comment>You don't need to do the readings, but make sure you go through lecture at least once every few weeks, because there is only so much information you can stuff into your brain before an exam---> there is a lot of information.</comment>You should take this class if you are remotely interested in science or even want to see if you are interested in science. You don't have to be "good" at science to enjoy this class and perform well in it. It's one of my favorite courses I've taken here and would honestly take it again to soak up the information. It answers a lot of questions about why humans do the daily things we do- so it is applicable. It approaches science from a macro perspective. The projects were good and not too time consuming. The readings were actually interesting and worth doing. They don't take up too much time. The midterm was fair and involves memorizing and understanding course material. The final was cumulative so you do need to spend time studying but it is definitely worth it. Overall the class wasn't too time consuming at all. TAKE THIS CLASS.</comment>The class is really interesting, but poorly structured. Professors Wrangham and Hinde know the material very well, and are excited to share it with students. Section is not well run, and exams are not well written. As a concentration requirement it is worth taking, but as an elective only take it if you're really interested in the material.</comment>take this class if you want an enjoyable class that still requires a lot of attention to work but is very rewarding</comment>The professors are awesome, super cool and present material in a very interesting way. The class is very engaging and will leave you thinking about humans and interactions in a different way. Great intro to HEB class, and it will totally get you hooked. The work is completely manageable and I would recommend this course to anyone considering HEB or just looking to meet the behavior req. Just a cool class about human behavior and interactions that is relevant to everyone.</comment>The class is great, but there is a great deal of information to be learned.</comment>Great class to explore human behaviors through an evolutionary lens. Sometimes the topics get tense but that's a good thing.</comment>There are lots of pre-meds so that should be taken into consideration (read: high levels of neuroticism).</comment>This class is a really good intro to HEB if you are thinking about pursuing the concentration and a relatively painless way to get the behavior requirement out of the way for current concentrators.</comment>An awesome and easy HEB class to ease someone into the subject and material.  Wrangham is also super cool so I'd recommend a class with him at some point.</comment>It's a decent overview for HEB classes, but it does cover a ton of content for a single semester. The workload is pretty manageable.</comment>Really fascinating class, pretty low workload, and straightforward but fun assignments. Section was awesome and I actually looked forward to discussing the material. Lectures could get dry at times but overall were interesting and included lots of case studies that I enjoyed. Stellar professors and TFs (Zarin is the best!). As an upperclassman HEB concentrator I felt that some of the material was repetition from other classes, but there was still enough new stuff to keep me interested.</comment>This is a really interesting class with two top professors, both of whom are approachable and kind with students.  The material is fascinating and will really enrich your outlook on human behavioral complexity.  I really liked how we learned many ways to look at situations, through different lenses and such.</comment>There's a lot of information covered, so really try to pace yourself! also lectures aren't recorded so pay attention</comment>You cover a lot of material in lectures but it is mostly rope memorization so study for the midterm and final early and pay attention to close details. They love asking which of the following is NOT true or a part of blah blah questions. Exams are multiple choice, true false, and short answer.</comment>This class is a great introductory course to HEB. The course covers a wide range of very interesting material.</comment>This course is awesome! You don't need to be a biology/science concentrator and although it is not a Gen Ed, it is the perfect example of a fascinating and challenging Gen Ed---there was a lot to learn but the material was very interesting and the class is very well organized. Take it!! You won't regret it.</comment>lots of great content, breadth and some depth</comment>Great introductory (or capstone!) HEB course. Really interesting concepts</comment>SUCH AN INTERESTING AND COOL COURSE. The teaching staff is so wonderful, and presents information in a concise and thought provoking way. I left every lecture pondering about something that was just said. The class as a whole really changed my perspective on lots of things and I feel as though my thinking has changed. In addition this is a great introduction to HEB so take it as a freshmen or sophomore for sure! The assignments are not difficult and are kind of cool, and the midterm though a little weird was reasonable.</comment></course>APMTH 203: Introduction to Disordered Systems and Stochastic Processes</title>it is a really nice course to broaden our view even if we are not working on physics or biology.</comment>This class was great. Ariel is a good teacher getting better by the day. You should definitely take a class with him if you have the chance. The class was very interesting and accessible. Definitely take it if you want an introduction to stochastic processes with applications in physics.</comment>This course was challenging but extremely interesting. Work with other students on the problem sets.</comment>Amazing and unique selection of topics. And Prof. Amir is an excellent teacher. Highly recommended.</comment>It's harder than the course description implies (or implied).</comment></course>CHEM 145: Experimental Inorganic Chemistry</title>If you have an interest in inorganic chemistry then you need to take this course. You will learn a lot of practical skills and learn to interpret a lot of spectroscopy. You will be able to read and understand the latest inorganic chem research literature. The course is very unique in that the student to TF/Prof ratio is very low.</comment>This was a great class and after taking it I feel much more comfortable in a lab setting.</comment>Excellent overview of synthetic and spectroscopic techniques relevant to inorganic chemistry. Excellent commitment from instructors including focus on effectively communicating results.</comment>This is an amazing lab class. With only 4 students, you get to work one-on-one with the teaching staff; the lab-work is also very interesting to do and you will learn a lot of good techniques. This class also prepares you to make presentations (unlike others which end in a paper).</comment></course>SCRB 230: Principles and Practice of Drug Development</title>This class was incredibly interesting and had a very seminar-like feel to it. This class would be great for you if you were looking for something more broad. You have the opportunity to listen to many different types of speakers, ranging from scientists to the CRO of a pharma company to a healthcare banker. It was fantastic to hear what is happening in the field and the decision process / processes behind it all.</comment>Take this! It will change your life.</comment>This class has very little workload and some fascinating speakers. It is also very flexible with attendance! I would recommend it for anyone who wants to learn the basics of pharma.</comment>This class seemed relatively easy, but grading was not always straightforward. Not a lot of feedback was given to students. I think the course would benefit greatly from adding a section component.</comment>This class was a great introduction to the pharmaceutical industry that had only two assignments - a "News of the Week" presentation and a final project and presentation. This meant that the work load for this class was really low, except around those two deadlines. If you're like me and you put off the work until the last moment, it was quite stressful. If you take the time to do research on your project over the course of the semester, you'll be much better off because this class was literally no work on a week-to-week basis. The lecturers were usually very interesting, especially because Professor Lee Rubin pulled in a lot more interesting biology speakers, stem cell labs and start-ups, etc. There's something for everyone who's interested in the drug development process in this class, but if you're not particularly interested in a lecture topic like manufacturing or something it can get pretty boring in class. Most of the time the class was very engaging though.</comment>Great course with very knowledgeable speakers every class!</comment>It's a fair course, but it all depends on your TF.</comment>Great class! :)</comment>A fantastic, guest-lecture-based course that is thought-provoking and good for rounding out a heavy or interview-filled semester. The onus is on the student, however, to pay attention and get something out of the weekly lecture since there are no weekly assignments or exams.</comment>This class is a topical survey course.  Great course to take while you are working on your thesis.  Very much a grad seminar.  Gives you some fun stuff to think about, but the real value in taking the course is the free time it offers you to work on the assignments.</comment>This is a good class if you're working on a thesis and don't have much time to commit to a SCRB req. The class meets once a week, and towards the later half of the semester, it becomes pretty clear that attendance is 'strictly optional'. I personally found the industrial discussions in the course somewhat tedious and was hoping that we would delve a little deeper into the science behind drug development.</comment>Participate! This is a fun and engaging class.</comment>This is a ridiculously easy class, half of the class didn't show up for most of it. The professors are well-intentioned, but what they don't understand is that simply inviting in biotech industry leaders and researchers to talk and not making any assignments or even really require attendance is going to result in disengaged students. All the lectures were discontinuous, and there were no common threads or anything concrete that I took out of this class. That being said, I was exposed to a wide array of the biotech industry and got a sense of all the things you can do in biotech, which makes me more excited about the field from a professional standpoint -- but in terms of anything concrete I learned from the class-- not much. Take it if you want a easy senior class or as a fifth class even.</comment>Light workload, mostly interesting material (if you pay attention to lecture)</comment>Very little work during the semester, but lots of work for the final project. You get exposed to variety of people in the pharmaceutical industry and doing lots of research. However, the class has very little structure - take this as you well.</comment>This class has a lot of potential to be really interesting and eye-opening, but the delivery falls short. Both the lecture and the projects are lacking in thoughtfulness and effort on the part of the professors, and there is little feedback or interaction between the students and the professor.

Only take this class if you need to fulfill requirements or if you need an easy class.</comment>This is an interesting and applicable class that's really useful and teaches you a lot without wasting your time on papers/exams. It's very loosely structure, so stay away if that's your thing, but otherwise this is a good class! Similar to 130 but much bigger.</comment></course>RELIGION 1444: God and Money</title>The topics discussed in this class were super interesting to me and would likely be very interesting to many people. The class is not difficult, but there is a good challenge at the end with the final paper. Some of the details about what material is taught in this class will still be worked out after the class' first year, I imagine. At this point, some material was great and some was less great, but it always made for interesting class discussion.</comment>This course opens an interesting and wide-ranging dialogue about the role of Judeo-Christian religion to speak to how our economy should be structured. The course (at least in its this year's version) does not build a consistent, thematic story like some other classes might, and it's less focused on lecture. Instead, it delves into a range of topics broadly related to God and money, and Professor Cox frequently opens the discussion for student input. In some ways this is a plus, since you are exposed to a lot of different thoughts. In other ways, the scattered nature of the course may not be what you are looking for if you want a course that clearly progresses through topics with clear connections between each one. A strength of this course is that students come from several Harvard schools including the divinity school, business school, and college, so there is room for a range of opinion.</comment></course>ENG-SCI 154: Electronic Devices and Circuits</title>Prof. Donhee is a nice person with great patience. This course is helpful with understanding the basic conformation of electronic device. Suits undergrad.</comment>I would only take this class if you have to for concentration requirement or if you really have the time and effort to put into the class. You really only take away as much time as you spend on it. The material can sometimes be a bit dry, you're learning about transistors after all. But it covers essential concepts for anyone that is seriously considering electrical engineering.</comment>This course will really teach you about circuits and some of the details and intricacies involved with circuit components. Any electrical engineer should definitely take thing course.</comment>Problem sets in the beginning do not take very long (6-8), but the later ones, (i.e. pset 6 onward) take a fair amount of time (15++). Professor Donhee does a great job building your understanding from the physical level to simple single transistor circuits with a few resistors to complex ones (oscillators, current mirrors, CMOS amplifiers). He is very knowledgeable, and expects a lot from his students. Don't ask questions he's already answered multiple times or whose answer is in the lecture notes</comment>Take only if it's a required course or if you are reeeeeally keen on learning how transistors/amplifiers/diodes function at an atomic level.</comment>Prof. Ham is not teaching this course next year so everything will change. That being said, material is interesting if you're interested in electrical engineering. Even then, you would probably wish there was more application based material.</comment>Well, it won't be taught by Donhee Ham anymore, so it will probably be totally different.  Take all of these evaluations with a grain of salt, because Donhee did things differently.</comment>Professor Ham is a terrific teacher. Take this class if you want to get a solid understanding of some electronic circuits and devices.</comment>If it's taught the same way, be prepared to put a lot into the psets. Also make sure to ask questions if you don't understand anything. Donhee tends to ask "Everyone got it?" and then move on. Speak up if you aren't caught up, everyone else in the class will appreciate it.</comment>You can learn a lot from Donhee and can see why he is so popular.</comment>Work with people and go to office hours--this stuff is hard.</comment>It's a nice course in that you do learn a lot and don't have to have the stress of an exam or labs.  However, the psets can be tough so make sure to begin them as early as possible so that you can get help in office hours.</comment>This class will give you a very thorough understanding of transistors. Professor Ham is brilliant and funny and very receptive to his students.</comment>Great class. The psets in the later half of the course are a bit challenging, but this class doesn't have exams so it evens out. Make sure you revise lecture notes. Prof.Ham is a genius and knows a lot about circuits. Also, don't EVER submit the pset late, as prof.Ham is very strict on the late hw policy (50% off)</comment>Tough course, lots of very important material for EE's but I don't think I would take it if it wasn't a requirement for my concentration.</comment></course>MCB 208: Talking about Science</title>I don't think this is a class that will really give you a chance to improve your presentation skills per se. You'll hear a lot of diverse opinions about what people like in presentations, but the opinions are often too disparate to be helpful. Also, you only get one chance to present.</comment>Honestly very glad I took this class. It's changed the way I prepare and deliver talks.</comment>It's a great class to take if you wish to improve your speaking style when giving scientific presentations. The pizza given every week is a welcome bonus!</comment>Useful! all scientists need to get better at giving talks. Jeff and Mike both are really good speakers, so they are well suited to teach this class.</comment></course>EXPOS 10.017: Introduction to Expository Writing</title>really helps your writing skills going from high school writing into expos 20</comment>it is a lot of writing be ready</comment>I thought I knew everything about writing an essay until I took this course. Over the semester I learned numerous ways to go about my analytical writing.</comment>If you don't feel a hundred percent sure about your academic writing, take Expo 10. It's not a stupid course for stupid people, but something that can really help you when you feel insecure coming to Harvard. I myself feel a lot better about my papers and Expo 20 next semester.</comment>Take the class if you no prior experinece in writing</comment>A very good class for people without writing experience. I feel like it really helped understand what analytical writing means.</comment>I got a lot out of this class, it made me more comfortable in my writing and I feel prepared to take Expos 20 now.</comment>TAKE EXPOS 10 WITH DR. MUMME!!! Even if you were placed into Expos 20, Expos 10 is an absolutely incredible course that makes you grow as a writer. Dr. Mumme is and INCREDIBLE professor whose feedbacks are incredibly thorough and helpful. You will never feel lost because you can always email her when you are stuck or if you need someone to bounce ideas off of. TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT!</comment></course>CLASPHIL 207: Augustine</title>Don't be scared away if all you know of Augustine are his philosophical writings. There's so much more to read and discover!</comment></course>FRENCH Ab: Beginning French II: Exploring Parisian Life and Identity</title>I took this purely for the language requirement after some high school experience and expected it to be terrible. Honestly, it was relatively painless, and I came out being much more comfortable with my french than I was at any point in high school. The curriculum is interesting, and it was certainly not as bad as I expected.</comment>It is fun and is efficient at teaching you moderate French</comment>Loved it SO MUCH. Amanda is the most amazing TF! Class is so much fun and my French skills improved drastically. I cannot believe how much my French has improved.</comment>Not as fun as French Aa but you go over a larger amount of material</comment>took this to fulfill the language requirement, did just that. cant say i particularly enjoyed it, but its all about what you put into the class.</comment>The class is fine although it escalated very quickly as compared to French Aa.</comment>Hey, if you're like me and need to get a foreign language out of the way, this is a relatively painless way of doing it. Taking the time to prioritize getting the work done (and with it, the requisite practice in utilizing the language) can be difficult as the semester wears on and you're more involved in your other classes. It's not too hard to just coast, but we'll see if that comes back to bite me in French C.</comment>This was such a fun class- absolutely the way to go if you need a language.  The play at the end was really fun- Amanda Gann was awesome and made every class fun and engaging so I actually wanted to learn French.</comment>Create a very unique character and really make an effort to post on Gmail! Also be creative in your essays.</comment>Take this class--French is a wonderful language! The assignments are fair and fun, and the teaching fellows are always awesome. Instead of major written midterm and final exams, there are different assessments like short quizzes, compositions, and oral exams.</comment>This course is very engaging. Expect work everyday but nothing too difficult. Study for the quizzes and take your time writing compositions. Tuo is very enthusiastic and makes the course fun.</comment></course>SOCIOL 173: The Sociological Eye: Learning about Society and Culture through Films</title>This class will teach you amazing theories that you will ACTUALLY use in other classes. I constantly referenced theories that I learned in this class in other classes.</comment>This class is a great way to gain a comprehensive view of the world of sociology. It is very interesting to tie the theorems of sociologists to modern films such as Avatar and The Wolf of Wall Street. Finally, the final project is incredibly fun and interesting.</comment>Great films! Interesting idea, but the lectures and sections weren't great.</comment>Take this class</comment>One of my favorite classes in 4 years at Harvard. Watch a bunch of classic movies (from the Godfather to the Wolf of Wall Street), write a few short papers, and then make a movie as your final exam. What's not to love?</comment>This class was approachable and fun, particularly if you are interested in learning more about people and how they interact on different scales.</comment>A great interactive course that you can be creative in as well.</comment>Great course that was both interesting and informative.</comment>Fun way to view sociology and sociological concepts through movies, TV shows, and other readings and papers</comment>Definitely take this class if you have even the slightest interest in integrating film and academic disciplines. This is a very chill class (assignments are simple and do not take long to complete), and the course content is really interesting. Plus, you get to watch fantastic films and shows (i.e., The Wire, House of Cards, The Godfather, The Social Network, Psycho, The Wolf of Wall Street, 12 Years a Slave, There Will Be Blood...need I say more?)</comment>Even if you don't think you will religiously watch the movies (most people didn't) it is pretty fun analyzing things like the Godfather and Avatar for once. A very laid back, fun course.</comment>Take this class if you like the plot content/message of movies.</comment>This was THE easiest class I've taken at Harvard, extremely basic and not at all stimulating discussion in lecture and section, lecture was really unnecessary, never needed to pay attention. It was all breadth, no depth. Teaches like 25 different topics in sociology, but none of them really offered anything worth remembering. If you've taken even one sociology course before, this will pale in comparison. Barely learned a thing, least challenging course at Harvard.</comment>This class is a great course surveying a variety of themes in sociology. However, the class is primarily focused on sociological arguments, not film or visual analysis. This might not appeal to a student interested in film studies or VES, but would be a good introductory course for students interested in pursuing sociology.</comment>Great course with interesting films and readings as well as great section discussion, which is rare. Films and topics covered a range of contemporary issues with classic must-see films. I felt like this course was an even better introduction to important topics in Sociology than my sophomore tutorial. It helps to work on the summary parts of the unit papers while doing the readings for the week, otherwise you have to go back later and reread to remember what the articles were about. Start the final project early and film short pieces throughout the semester. Definitely recommend this class and would take it again if I had the chance!</comment>Awesome class</comment></course>MATH 99r: Tutorial</title>Take it very seriously. If you don't you won't learn much, and that's both not good and not a good feeling.</comment>99r is different with each set of lecturers, but in general I think the tutorials are good if you find the material to be of interest.</comment></course>CHNSE Ba: Elementary Modern Chinese</title>Do the work diligently, don't fall behind. The course is easy if you put enough time in and are consistent.</comment>It is a lot. Work every day, so only take it if you are dedicated. But you learn so much.</comment>1. You have a choice of whether to learn simplified or traditional. Only learn traditional if you’re going into East Asian studies (or planning on studying something where you would need to be able to read older texts that are in traditional), or if you want to go to Taiwan and Hong Kong and want to be able to read things. Although even then, it’s not necessary. Traditional is NOT helpful for if you want to go to mainland China – at all. At first, professors use traditional all the time in class (in powerpoints, grammar handouts, etc.). However, by the end of the year, everything was being written in simplified.   2. Be prepared to spend a lot of time studying characters – especially if you’re taking traditional. You need to learn how to write 20 per week, but be able to recognize ALL the characters in the book for each lesson. I made flashcards for everything, which was really helpful.   3. Overall, would recommend this class. It’s fun and you’ll really learn a lot, even if you’ve had Chinese before. I was pleased with the amount of characters we learned and how much we could read by the end of the semester. If your other classes involve a lot of writing (or if you’re a grad student), this class will be a nice departure from that. Of course you still need to dedicate a lot of time to the class, but when it’s a different kind of homework from what you usually have, it’s a nice break. It may be a lot of work, but you’ll feel like you really learned and accomplished a lot by the time the semester is over. Definitely recommend!</comment>You will learn quite a bit of Chinese for a beginning class. However, be prepared to commit time to memorizing characters especially. The grammar is not especially hard.</comment>Good course to start off learning Chinese. Lessons are structured logically and progress as a decent pace that is neither fast not slow. By the end of te semester, you will be surprised at how much you have learned and honestly be able to carry at least basic Chinese conversations. The only annoying part is that there are a lot of people with prior Chinese experience which may make it frustrating if you are just starting to learn. Overall great class and the teachers were all wonderful and sections is actually really fun!</comment>If you want learn Chinese, this is the best way to learn it.</comment>THIS WAS THE BEST CLASS I HAVE TAKEN AT HARVARD THUS FAR!!! Seriously, the Chinese Language Department is the most interactive and attentive department at Harvard. All the TFs and the Professor truly want you to succeed and they offer so many opportunities for you to ask questions and seek help. I have nothing bad to say about this course.</comment>Chinese is a great language to learn, and this course does a great job doing it. It can require a good deal of work and memorization, but it is worth it.</comment>Spend time practicing with a teacher and also on your own. Practice literally makes perfect.</comment>teaching faculty is great and many opportunities to practice. very rewarding if you put in the work</comment>Do not be afraid to take this class just because it's a completely new language! The regularity of the schedule makes sure that you can't fall behind as long as you put in a little work everyday, and the teachers are all very available and quick to help. There's also a lot of small assignments that end up as padding for your grade, so the course is overall very manageable.</comment>Fantastic class with a great teaching staff who really want to help you. I wasn't sure if I wanted to continue studying Chinese after fulfilling my language requirement, but now I plan to take Chinese beyond the first year because the teachers made it such a great experience. This class does have a good amount of work, so be prepared to study a decent amount every week, especially in the beginning when you're doing the foundation work. It'll make the rest of the course much easier!</comment>Pay attention, and don't slack off, and you will be fine.</comment>This class is awesome -- if you have any interest in Mandarin Chinese, you should definitely consider taking it. Admittedly, the workload is rather immense, but the good thing is that you are never really faced with one huge assignment; rather, you end up doing a ton of smaller pieces of work (weekly homeworks, dialogue memorization, character practice for dictation etc) over the course of the entire semester. Do not do what I did and fall behind; the course can get very nerve-wracking in that case. This class is also great for those who think they simply "don't possess the language gene". After 3 months, you will be amazed when looking at the progress you've made.</comment>Very good and fun class to be, but don't slack off because you might be left behind forever due to its fast pace. But if you come to all the classes and sections, you'll be fine.</comment>It takes a lot of hours of work per week, but the progress you make toward the goal of learning the language is insane. But, seriously, sooooo much work.</comment>You can't go wrong with this class - it's harder to learn than some other languages because characters are completely different from letters, but it has a lot of applications and it also opens up the possibility of working/studying abroad in Asia.</comment>If you've ever had any desire to learn Chinese, take this course!!! It was amazing from the instructors to how well the material is taught to the other students to how much you'll learn in just one semester (significantly more than one semester of a high school language class). The Harvard Chinese department is famous for how well it teaches around the world for good reason. It's also great, because the instructors rotate sections, so you get to have each for a bit. Unlike previous years, you could also opt to just learn simplified characters this year, which was great.  Also, even if you're an upperclassman, don't be hesitant to take it--I did, even though I've already satisfied my language requirement and had a fantastic time. The course is a mix of all years and graduate students, which was fun. As long as you do the work for each day (although there is something due virtually every day, it's not a lot), it's not as hard as others may make it out to be. Only downside--the course is located in Vanserg, which is absurdly far. It's hard to take classes on either side, because you'll be perpetually late.</comment>If you are interested in chinese, take it 100%.  If you're not passionate about it, it might be a challenge</comment>TAKE THIS COURSE if you have any interest in learning Chinese! It is challenging and time-consuming, especially if you aren't particularly adept at learning languages, but totally worth it. If you are willing to put in the work you will be amazed at how much you can learn in just one semester. I can't wait to continue my study of Chinese in this excellent department!</comment>This is an awesome course that teaches you a ton over the course of just one semester. If you have a lot of exposure to Chinese please don't take this class, you just make it harder on actual beginners like myself who are easily intimidated by people who took Chinese in high school. Great class if you're willing to put in the time!</comment>Great way to learn a lot of Chinese in a short amount of time! Definitely requires work, but the teaching staff is amazing, and will make it worthwhile! I think anyone is capable of doing it if they put in the work.</comment>If you really want to learn Chinese, this is the best way to get started.  You learn so much, and build such a good foundation with such little time.</comment>Even though many students come into Chinese Ba with a few years of Chinese classes, total beginners shouldn't be afraid to take this course; after all, it is supposed to cater to beginners. The professor and TFs will hold your hand in the beginning and through to the end of the course if you find you need it. The dialogues are fun and the class is quick and dynamic, so I personally enjoyed the class very much. I don't really recommend Chinese Ba to people who are looking to painlessly knock out a language requirement, but I definitely do to anyone who is remotely interested in the Chinese language.</comment>This is the best taught class offered at Harvard. It is very difficult, but equally rewarding. This class is so awesome. I looked forward to going to Chinese everyday and I want to now pursue a Chinese citation so I can continue to work with this incredible department.</comment>This is a really solid introduction to Chinese. The teaching staff's teaching methods are very good. It feels like there has been research into language learning that went into designing this course</comment>really amazing program. take advantage of the languages at this school, you won't regret it. You need to put time in and it's not an easy class, but if you want to learn Chinese there is no better place to do it.</comment>Keep up with the vocabulary and grammar! It will only make the later lessons easier to understand</comment>The amount of work you do in this class depends on how much prior experience you have studying Chinese. If you have no exposure whatsoever, it will be a very challenging course. If you have studied a little bit of Chinese before, the class will be much, much more managable.</comment>This is a thorough, well-structured, and fun class.</comment>Chinese Ba is an excellent and very well organized course. All the instructors are very helpful and genuinely try to make the course fun. The drill section was probably the best part of the course. It both reinforced the material from lecture, and allowed people to get to know their classmates. That said, Chinese is a very difficult language, and be aware that it's very easy to fall behind in lecture if you don't study for a few days.</comment>Such a rewarding class!</comment>This class will be a lot of work, but the language skills you will emerge with are extremely rewarding.</comment>Be prepared to invest a ton of energy and time into this course. It is not a joke. If you're looking for an easy way to fulfill the foreign language requirement, look elsewhere.</comment>This class moves at a very fast rate, but it a nice introduction course to learning Chinese.</comment>This is not an easy class but if you love languages definitely take it.</comment>It is a great course that is taught exceedingly well (much better than high school Chinese classes). That being said, there will be individuals in the class that have taken some Chinese before, just don't get discouraged.</comment>Teachers are wonderful!</comment>This course is very fast-paced and you have to be ready to put in a lot of outside work to be prepared in class and for assessments.</comment>It's tough but worth it! Very fast paced but at the end realizing how much you've learned in a completely new language is extremely rewarding.</comment>This class comes with a significant time commitment, but is well worth it. It gives you a functional knowledge of speaking/reading/writing Chinese.</comment>This is an excellent class! Teachers are supremely amazing, and the way they structure the classes are so efficient. Definitely take it, they make learning Chinese fun and enjoyable!</comment>If you're looking to learn Chinese this is the absolute best place to do it. The teachers really care about your experience in the class and are willing to help you individually anytime you need it.</comment>If you're serious about wanting to learn Chinese, this course is for you. It moves at a quick but manageable pace. Don't expect to move through it like a romance language (I studied French), they're very different and Chinese requires a lot of your time. However, after one semester it'll feel extremely rewarding and I'm excited to continue studying it. I studied Chinese in China for a summer and while I learned a lot of spoken Chinese I left China not knowing how to read or write anything. This course is comprehensive and it covers it all!</comment>This class is definitely worth your time! It is very fun and engaging, and you will learn a lot. All of the teachers are fantastic!</comment>Wonderful course. You'll not only learn a ton (and watch your skills grow exponentially by the week) but have a ton of fun. I've never taken a class that's made me laugh so hard on a regular basis. The class exhibits some of the best teaching at Harvard (these instructors straight-up care about your learning), and if you've got a bit of a knack for languages, the work won't crush you whatsoever (the weekly assessments and homework are extremely reasonable). Lastly, you'll make friends in this course. Section thrice a week develops a real community.</comment>It is a great class to pick up a difficult language that Chinese is. You will get a lot out of it if you put in the time and the effort.</comment>Workload can get rigorous for someone with no background in Chinese, but it's well worth it. If you put in the time, you will look back and be amazed at how much you learn over the course of the semester.</comment>From someone who has studied several languages, Chinese Ba is far and above the best language course I have taken. Mandarin is a difficult language to learn, but throughout this course I felt a tangible sense of progress each class session. The teachers are helpful and enthusiastic, and all of the work assigned pointed at a goal of being able to converse fluently in the language, which it accomplished very well.</comment>Chinese Ba is extremely strong in teaching spoken Mandarin. The instructors, who are extremely enthusiastic and friendly, reinforce language learning through call-and-response exercises and dialogues. Sections and lecture are genuinely fun (and, at times hilarious), which is a good thing, because this class meets every day. Every week, students are expected to teach themselves how to read approx. 40 characters, and write half as many. There are also weekly homework sheets, dialogue memorizations, and dictation quizzes. Though the workload ramps up towards the end of the course, it is completely do-able so long as you are diligent about practicing about half an hour every night. By the end of the semester, class will be taught almost entirely in Chinese, and you'll find yourself understanding every word.</comment>To master the language and truly excel in this class, you need to practice every single day. Chinese is very difficult, and if you don't maintain a strong study routine it could be a very long semester. But if you're willing to put in the time, this is an amazing opportunity; rarely at this university will you receive so much individual attention from excellent teachers.</comment>Take the course if you wanna learn Chinese. Don't take it for fun, unless you already know some Chinese. If you are true beginner, meaning you've had zero Chinese language experience, than be ready for a tough semester with a lot of studying. In the end, you learn a ton of Chinese, and the language that seemed so hard before starts looking easier and easier.</comment>A very instructive and even fun class to expose you to Chinese language as well as culture. The teaching staff is also wonderful and receptive.</comment>Chinese Ba is hard. Even if you work diligently, it's hard. You're going to wake up some days and hate it, then feel okay about it, then hate it again. But it's worth it.</comment>If you are willing to be attentive and motivated throughout a semester in Chinese Ba, and if you recognize that your commitment (or lack thereof) one week will affect your understanding the next week, you are prepared for this class. Anyone with an interest in beginning Chinese should take this class; with enough study, you can excel.</comment>If you're interested in learning a language, learn chinese! It might be difficult at first (especially the tones!) but after a while, you get adjusted to the pace. Zhou Laoshi and the rest of the staff are very enthusiastic about teaching and will help you learn the most chinese you possibly can.</comment>I decided to take Chinese as a junior after previously taking Spanish. I never studied Chinese before, and this class was very difficult. However, I have taken few classes at Harvard as rewarding as Chinese BA. Be ready to work, and, if you commit to the course, you will see incredible results.</comment></course>CULTR&BLF 16: Performance, Tradition and Cultural Studies: An Introduction to Folklore and Mythology</title>This is one of the best classes I have taken at Harvard- the material is interesting and relevant. Great way to fulfill a gen ed requirement, and I would recommend it as an elective. Definitely the kind of the class where you get out what you put in- doing the readings helps you get a lot out of the class but probably aren't necessary to know until the midterm and final.</comment>An interesting topic that I don't think is explored terribly often.</comment>Don't be put off by the dry first lectures. This class is a lot of fun and really interesting. Steve and Nicole are wonderful faculty- incredibly sweet and approachable. This is a fun Gen Ed, low workload, you get to collect stories about Harvard. If you're interested in doing Folklore and Mythology (which you should) it's a great introduction to the department and the academic topics of folklore.</comment>Course is manageable, but be prepared to read a larger amount of materials each week</comment>The readings are really interesting. Make sure you do them and try to take some notes or keep up a glossary of terms. Definitely take the class, it was fantastic. The oral exam was a great format and the collections were brilliant for learning more about Harvard and talking to new people.</comment>This is a fantastic course! Steve is a great lecturer who captured my attention from the first day, and Nicole is a great TF who gives lots of advice, especially for the writing assignments. Definitely pay attention in class, because the topics are so varied and interesting.</comment>This class is really great! Steve is an excellent professor - really knows his stuff, very engaged and makes you excited abut the material. You get to jump around all over the field of folklore and mythology, do a lot of interesting readings and watch movies.</comment>This is one my absolute favorite classes I have taken at Harvard.  It is really evident in this class that Dr. Mitchell and Nicole care deeply about the material and more importantly, their students.  This class is fun and very different from most other classes at Harvard. Absolutely anyone, no matter your concentration, will enjoy this class.  Yes, there is reading you have to do, but it is all very interesting, so it is enjoyable to do.  The important thing is that you feel supported and encouraged by the teaching staff in the process which makes it such an incredible experience.</comment>This is class is incredibly interesting -- and, fear not, it's not all Greek mythology and stuff from hundreds of years ago. You will definitely get a sense for what 'folklore' is, how it impacts our lives, and how it still exists today. The professor, Steve,  and the TF, Nicole, are fantastic, very kind, and always willing to answer any questions you might have about the course. Take it!</comment></course>PSY 980h: In the Presence of the Enemy: Social-Psychological Approaches to Intergroup Conflict</title>I would highly recommend taking this seminar before you graduate. If you have ever studied historical or present day conflicts and want to gain a deeper understanding to the causes and solutions to those current events, this class is perfect for that.</comment>Great class! I learned a lot and the work was extremely manageable.</comment>If you're interested in conflicts and their (potential or possible) resolutions at all, whether they be in the U.S. or abroad, you should definitely take this class! It's very well-structured and takes you through several important theories in this area of study that are fascinating to apply to different real-world scenarios. I liked that it was an effective combination of theory and application. The readings can be quite intensive, but they are super interesting and doable if you set aside time to do them. You are given quite a significant amount of flexibility when it comes to writing assignments, and Mariska is great at providing feedback and support, and to just serve as a sounding board to bounce ideas off of.</comment>If you aim to better understand conflict theory, the readings in this course will undoubtedly propel you toward achieving that goal. However, don't expect to enjoy section-- your peers may take pride in 'getting away with' doing little to no prep work beforehand. Furthermore, this course does need to improve with regard to feedback given on assignments and expectations outlined for assignments prior the due date. It's a little unstable at the moment, and I have no idea what my grade will be despite hours spent trying to improve my work based on prior feedback. It's incredibly unpredictable.</comment></course>SCRB 190: Understanding Aging: Degeneration, Regeneration, and the Scientific Search for the Fountain of Youth</title>Really great class in which you learn a lot about the underlying mechanisms that may contribute to aging as well as the diseases that increase in incidence as we age. The aging farmwork of the course really forms a good base for the different lectures that at time can seem disconnected, but you really do learn a lot. There is also minimal work, but this also makes it hard to gauge how well you're doing throughout the semester and the feedback provided isn't very great.</comment>This course is easy and pretty interesting. You'll survey a bunch of topics without going into much detail. Think of taking this as an easy science class to balance a harder schedule.  SCRB 190 is a survey course, so it never really goes into great detail.This means you won't be working very hard, but you also won't be learning a whole lot. Many of the topics you will have heard of before, and they'll just put a spin on them. So again: easy and fun, but not the right course for you if you really want to gain a deeper understanding of biology.</comment>Amy is a rising star in the field, and Lee has experience producing an actual pharmaceutical agent. Take this class if you want to have a real Harvard undergraduate experience.</comment>Midterms are not terrible. The final project is kind of a pain in the rear. The "psets" are not psets and super annoying because you WILL forget to do them because they are just simple responses. If you take this class, set reminders for yourself. They're so small that they will be forgotten to be done. If you're anything like me, you'll want to pay attention to the presentations. The presentations are where you learn a lot of interesting things not taught in lecture, so focus on that if you are going to take the course - it's an escape from sometimes boring coursework. All in all, the course is a bit of a let down, you do learn a ton of interesting things, but it's like beating a dead horse a lot of times, because we just don't know too many things about the aging process. However, Lee and Amy are great lecturers and their excitement will remind you of why you are a science concentrator - to discover the stuff we don't know about aging (and make these courses more concrete.) They are genuinely really excited about the course material, so even if you end up like me and turn out not to be super interested in the material, you at least have enthusiastic lecturers who make it better. Other than that, in the words of many SCRB seniors, I quote, "it's your standard B+ science course."</comment>This class provides an interesting background on the biology of aging. However, I think what was a let down for me was the amount of hype put forward by previous students. This is a good class - you will learn new content, and the professors are very friendly. But it is not some life changing course as some students will make it out to be.  The midterms can also be a hit or miss</comment>Take this course if you're genuinely interested in the scientific basis of aging. Don't take this if you're looking for a bare-bones, time-saver class. You -will- need to study for exams and put in good effort for the final project.</comment>I found this class very interesting. This is the only class I have taken that actually changed my perspective on a biological concept. I had always thought of aging as an inevitability and not a treatable disease. Also, the workload is highly manageable.</comment>Best course I have taken at Harvard so far!</comment>Very little work feedback.</comment>Really an awesome class. Great teachers, awesome subject matter.</comment>This is a great course. The work is manageable and the exams are fair. The professors are awesome!</comment>The lecture set up can get somewhat repetitive, but the material is very interesting and relevant!</comment>This class gives a perspective on aging that is quite interesting. It made me think about questions I had never really thought about before. Exams are really fair. The paper presentations were terrifying at first, but they got easier to do as the semester went on. The final project is pretty rewarding if you start early, get help from the professors, and really put the work in (but not an unreasonable amount of work).</comment>The class is very informative and provides varying perspectives of aging while posing thought provoking topics both scientific and philosophic.</comment>The material is interesting, but the course could be organized better. Amy and Lee are great, though!</comment>The professors for SCRB 190 are great and the material is really interesting. Be sure to keep on top of the material presented each week to do well on exams and problem sets.</comment></course>HIST 2426: Topics in the History of Gender and Sexuality: Research Seminar</title>I would highly recommend not only picking a topic but doing a fair amount of secondary reading before the course begins. The research component of the course gets going very quickly, and it's difficult to be reading long secondary works while trying to come up with a research design and an argument.</comment>If you are a gender historian this is an essential seminar to take with one of the best gender historians in the U.S.</comment>I would strongly discourage students from taking this class if they do not already have a paper idea in mind because there is not enough time to think of an idea and then execute it fully. Anyone who does have a paper idea should absolutely take this course because it will help them develop an excellent paper and give them a good framework for future projects as well.</comment>This is a challenging course, and requires quite a bit of your time and effort, but it is incredibly worth it!</comment>This course is excellent. It provides a chance to workshop your essay ideas, to develop presentation skills and to thoroughly think through an article-length project.</comment></course>GOV 2474: Approaches to the Study of the US Congress: Models and Methods</title>If you are an undergrad writing (or thinking about writing) a thesis that relates to Congress, this is a great class to take. It covers much of the literature/theories on Congress that you should know. In addition, you will have the opportunity to write a potential thesis chapter or another paper that could be published.</comment>Fantastic course and very relevant to undergraduates writing a thesis about Congress. It is an incredibly opportunity to learn from two of the most accomplished Congressional scholars and learn more about the literature on Congress.</comment></course>EXPOS 10.016: Introduction to Expository Writing</title>Any student could take this, but more should. Expos 10 allows people to refine writing skills and learn new ones. Knowledge I learned in Expos 10 will help me all throughout college and life. This course allowed me to explore writing more in depth and I found confidence in my writing skills that I had never had before.</comment>One of the best transitions from high school to college writing. Even if you are a great writer, provides a great background for entering Expos 20 without the stress of possibly doing "bad" in a course upon entering college.</comment>If you're not as confident in your writing skills as I was coming out of high school, I would really recommend taking Expos 10! It's a great way to ease yourself into the expectations Harvard has when it comes to writing.</comment>Dr.Herron is a really down to earth professor. Amazing human being and instructor.</comment>Take it! James Herron is an excellent instructor. His feedback is perfect and he has a way of getting information or arguments out of you when you think you have none.</comment></course>PSY 975: Contemporary Issues in Psychology: Intensive Cross-level Analyses for Cognitive Neuroscience and Evolutionary Psychology</title>I obviously can't say whether this is superior to the 971 option, but taken on its own merits it is an absolutely fantastic class. The topics are wide-ranging and relevant, as well as ripe for debate and unpacking. The workload was challenging but definitely manageable - usually three readings per week + a very brief response paper, plus a separate writing assignment every week or so. David was an amazing instructor - patient, engaging, and seemingly endlessly knowledgeable on the topics we covered. The final paper was a fantastic opportunity to make a novel contribution to psychology; I feel like my thesis could actually lead to research down the line. What's more, if you haven't written for psych before, this assignment will bring you up to speed. All in all a great class. Side note: for people on the Social Psych track like me, this course is a great way to survey neuropsych topics while also fulfilling your Tutorial requirement.</comment>The quality of your seminar will largely depend on who your classmates are, since it's mostly discussion-based. If David teaches 975 again in the future, he is a wonderful seminar leader who instills his students with both passion and self-confidence. The readings are usually fascinating and you do become a better reader and writer of psychology through this course.</comment>A very important class that's relatively painless if you put the time and effort into it</comment>The course is hard, but so worth it. You feel like a proud, accomplished psychologist at the end!</comment>This class is a commitment but a worthy one. The workload isn't to be trifled with (~6 hours+ a week depending on the assignment for the week), but with the write tutor leader, it's awesome. I can honestly say that I walked away from this class with a better understanding of the psychology field and my writing has improved SO MUCH. I understand now fully why it is a requirement and I'm glad I decided to take it. One note, I hadn't yet taken my neuroscience class before taking the tutorial so I did struggle at times to grasp the neuroscience concepts, but it wasn't a huge part of the course.</comment></course>ECON 1123: Introduction to Econometrics</title>This class was really annoying especially because it's required for concentrators. There is literally no content in this course. Stock is a great professor and a really smart guy, but ec1123 could easily be reduced to a 5 page review guide. There are literally 5 concepts in the course and they are unbelievably easy. It was even more frustrating because the staff recognize this and purposely made the course difficult if you don't go to class (lecture notes aren't helpful, lectures and sections cover different material). This attempt to make a course more legitimate is really upsetting. My recommendation is that it is appended to stat 104 in the last two weeks and the entire course is skipped altogether.</comment>If you don't have to take it for a requirement, do not put yourself through it.</comment>Speaking as someone doing an Econ secondary that did not HAVE to take this class, you could do worse. Lecture is admittedly somewhat boring and tends to focus on less relevant topics, but the teaching staff is excellent and problem sets are not overly painful. The material itself is useful, and has outside applications.</comment>Learning from Stock is an incredible experience, and it's particularly refreshing because he really likes the students and seems to enjoy teaching the class. Lecture can seem very unrelated to everything (and sometimes boring and a bit overwhelming because it's so confusing), but go because Stock is just one of those really incredible professors. The problem sets are fairly easy in the beginning but quickly become more complicated and time-consuming: use the TFs!! Generally all the TFs for this class were fantastic. This class is also just really useful because if you're studying economics, pretty much everything you do in an upper level class depends on econometrics.</comment>Make sure to go to section (and take notes since you won't have access to ANY answers) and know the psets well. The psets aren't graded hard but the material forms the basis for exams.</comment>The lectures for this class are not great, but the material is interesting and so helpful in other econ classes. The teaching staff is good and accessible and the problem sets are manageable and help a lot with understanding the practical applications of the theory.</comment>necessary but difficult</comment>As long as you go to lecture and have a good TF, this course is extremely manageable. If you have a good conceptual knowledge of the material, you should do well on the exams (which are very fair). It's definitely not easy but if you put time into it's actually pretty interesting! I was dreading taking this and looking back I kind of enjoyed what we learned.</comment>While econometrics is not a subject many people find very fun, this course is not that terribly boring - the professor is the best anyone could ask for in the field - if people want to ask questions, Prof. Stock is always willing to start an engaging conversation and is curious to find out students' opinions. The class is very theoretical, but the problem sets are applicable to real life issues, which is the most interesting part.</comment>Great course, coherent workload, extremely useful. If professor Stock is teaching it, just take it.</comment>Contrary to rumor, this is one of the easier Ec requirements at Harvard. It's also really useful (I would HIGHLY recommend taking this class in conjunction with 970).</comment>Boring, but in the end, a useful class. Lectures were unnecessary, but sections were helpful.</comment>Pretty painless course - I'd recommend to anyone remotely interested as it provides some pretty useful skills that can actually be put to use in the real world.</comment>This class is good! Professor Stock is a pretty decent lecturer, and the problem sets were fair. The TFs were quite accessible, and the information you learn in this class is quite useful!</comment>Professor Stock is amazing, he makes the course very applicable to real-world problems.</comment>This class is very useful. You learn how to criticize econometric models. It is a bit dry, though. Stock is leader in the field.</comment>Prof. Stock is great, very smart and a great guy to learn from. There is a great curve on exams, and the problems sets are graded pretty easy, which is nice because they take a long time.</comment>This is basically Stat 104 all over again. But if you're debating between this and Econ 1126, at least 1123 will let you review your Stata skills. 1126 will let you review algebra skills which are obviously not nearly as useful. So you might as well choose this, even though Professor Stock is a bit boring.</comment>Stock is a phenomenal professor, teaches very well and grades the class very fairly. I recommend taking the class with him if you can! I was expecting econometrics to be painful, but it wasn't at all and I attribute that to both Stock and my TF (who you should try to get if you can) John, who explained things incredibly well.</comment>Lectures and problem sets don't directly relate to tests, but you gotta take it.</comment>Econometrics is not always the most thrilling subject and the lectures were sometimes tough to sit through, but this course is much more enjoyable that you would think. Stock could be boring at times but overall was a great professor. The teaching staff is awesome: sections were incredibly helpful for understanding the material and completing the problem sets. The problem sets were very manageable and sometimes even fun to do, and I found the midterm to be very fair. I really thought I learned a lot of really useful material in this class and liked it much more than I thought I would.</comment>I would not recommend taking this course unless you're an Ec concentrator. It's unfortunate that lectures are not available online, especially since lecture notes are next to useless. Find the good TFs and go to their sections. This class taught me how to BS that good regressions are bad and bad regressions are good and everything in between, which doesn't seem to be useful in a real-world setting. Exams weren't too difficult, but had some questions that unfairly fished for very specific answers.</comment>It's not as bad as people say. But it's not like you have a choice anyways...</comment>This class is a necessary evil</comment>It is all about the psets</comment>This is an easy course that fulfils the econometric requirement. No need to buy the textbook.</comment>Professor Stock is really knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the material and all of the TF's are really familiar with the material (and break it down during section) and know other real world applications too!</comment>This is a mandatory ec class, but Professor Stock makes it pretty painless.</comment>Prof. Stock is a very good teacher if you want to appreciate the understanding behind the stats/psets. I cannot speak for the other teacher of the course but if you have a choice I highly recommend Prof. Stock.</comment>Just a necessary evil. Put in the work and you will survive. Easy to get a B</comment>This class is great. 1123 gives you tools to analyze data from the world around and develop statistical models that are not just limited to economics. If you took Stat 104 and liked stat, but felt like you weren't really doing anything useful, this is the perfect class. There are so many application for what you can learn in this class.</comment>This course is very difficult.</comment>Take if you need to for ec</comment>This class was definitely an improvement from the past few years... but not by much. I think Stock did a great job bringing in real-world examples into lecture, but sometimes lecture wasn't as helpful in actually learning the material. The first half of the semester was straight-forward, but I thought that the second-half was poorly taught and more time needed to be devoted to that. It's a requirement for Ec concentrators, and even though I did struggle in the course, it definitely made me think more about what I want to do in the future.</comment>This class has been one of my least favorite at Harvard thus far. I do not believe it is taught very well (apart from my excellent TF who did a great job of helping out when needed). Also, I do not believe that the problem sets prepare you much for the midterm/final.</comment>Only take the course because you must for economics. Go to section because you will learn more there than in lecture. The lectures are confusing and unhelpful.</comment>This class was not too difficult. While you may get lost in Professor Stock's lectures, sections are designed in order to help you learn the material. The PSETs weren't too challenging until the end. I recommend having a buddy to complete them with.</comment>GO TO LECTURE!! ACTUALLY!! AND FLIPPIN' PAY ATTENTION!!</comment>If you are in economics, you gotta take it. As an elective it might not be the most fun, but it is interesting to think in the way that econometrics gets you to consider problems and what data is telling you.</comment>Please do not take this class unless you are an Econ concentrator (in that case, it's a requirement unfortunately.). The material is boring. Professor Stock is one of the most intelligent people I've ever met; however, he cannot teach. If you have to take this class, try to get John Coglianese as your TF. He taught me more econometrics that the textbook, psets, and lectures did.</comment>Don't shoot yourself in the foot by skipping lecture, just done. Finals week will be hell if you do that. You can get through the midterm with the textbook but the final is a different ballgame.</comment>Try and get Peter Tu as a section leader! Great class - really hones your Stata skills and regression analysis.</comment>This is a dry course but I think if you focused on Stock's lectures you would get a lot of the information that you wouldn't need to read the book for the problem sets and exams. The hard part is focusing. Most of the section leaders are not great. I would go to Jessica and John's and maybe Peter's section. Avoid the others.</comment>Stock is a great professor - enjoyed the course and I believed I gained a better understanding of how economists think about regressions and data analysis.</comment>You really need to stay on top of your stuff from the beginning, because the class just builds and builds. also review your stat 104 stuff, statistics is a huge part of this class. it's a  tough class but if you are an ec concentrator you have to take it. definitely make sure you do the psets out thoroughly they are really helpful</comment>Very practical, well-taught econometrics class</comment>Very dry lectures, learned everything in section/problem sets. GO TO SECTION</comment>Love the material, and for most it is probably required, but the teaching is absolutely horrid.</comment>The nature of econometrics is very dry -- it's difficult to teach it well and make it interesting -- but overall, this class ended up being better than I expected. From what I've heard about previous iterations of the course, I think Professor Stock is the best Ec 1123 instructor. He's enthusiastic about the material and tries to make it as interesting as possible, including useful and relevant applications to policy and economic trends in real life. The section TFs are all good, know the material, and are incredibly helpful -- if you never go to lecture, i would recommend at least going to section. The first part of the course is pretty similar to Stat 104 material, but the course definitely gets difficult after the midterm (all new material). If you're an Ec concentrator, it's one of those things you have to get through...but I would recommend taking it with Stock if you can.</comment>Everyone seems to think this class is really hard, but it's not that bad if you can get to the root of what you need to do.  I'm not that great at stats, but I found this course relatively simple since all you have to do for most of it is follow a process they give you.  Just get Peter or go to his sections and forget about lecture. His one hour will tell you everything you need to know to ace this class</comment>It's a lot of work, but probably very useful if you're writing a quantitative thesis.</comment>Great teaching staff. Professor Stock cares about students and he is genuinely interesting in teaching undergrads. All T.Fs were great. John is incredible!!</comment>Only if Ec concentrator.</comment>If you go to lecture and section and make sure you understand all of the problem sets, this class is actually pretty enjoyable. When you take a step back and think about what you're actually doing in the problem sets, it's pretty cool.</comment>Professor Stock is extremely well-versed in the subject, if not the foremost leader in the field. His lectures are very theorhetical and often over our heads, but I think going to class helps even if you don't always understand it, because section every friday really sorted things out.</comment>It is what it is. Intro to Econometrics. Many have to take it. Few love it.</comment>Kinda hard, but very useful content.</comment>Prof Stock is an amazing professor. His mastery of the subject matter, practical experience and enthusiasm makes this course enjoyable. He is also good at explaining new concepts with clarity. The course is appropriately paced. This is one of the best courses I have ever taken.</comment>Stock's lectures aren't great, nor are the sections. Save time by reading the book. I find econometrics quite interesting but it definitely involves a lot of technical details about things like standard errors, so it's not everyone's cup of tea. This class requires very little work (3-4 hours per week for a problem set) and is very generously graded.</comment>This class is a bit dry during class as Prof. Stock loves to get into the theory behind every regression and reason through the math, so over half the class stopped showing up after a couple weeks. That said, you don't need to go to class to do well -- go to section for concepts and OH for psets and you'll be set. Try to get into the head TF Jessica's section -- she's an amazing teacher and very nice. Confusing concepts are cleared up in section, not class. The course is overall well-organized and the exams are very fair. Put in the time and work and you'll do well.</comment>Don't take it unless you have to.</comment>If you're an Econ concentrator you just have to get through this course.  Take advantage of sections.</comment>Take this course with Stock! I took it with Chaney and dropped it and waited - so glad I did.  Stock is passionate about the material and makes a dry subject come alive.  Way more interesting than I imagined... actually, sometimes enjoyed lecture.  Go to lecture and section and save yourself a lot of pain before the final!!!</comment>The lectures are very closely connected to the textbook, which Professor Stock co-authored, so it is a great resource to look into if lecture was bit confusing or hard to follow.</comment>Just put in the time to understand the methods and their applications. Attend section and do your work.</comment>Professor Stock's lectures are so dry, but he really is passionate about the subject and means well. The psets are actually helpful and the TFs are great, so in the end, it's worth it to take this class and learn really applicable and useful skills of econometrics.</comment>This class is tough, but it is required for economics concentrators.  I wish I had put in more effort throughout the semester to really understand the stuff we learned because the stuff you do is very practical, relevant, and useful in many class, future jobs, and graduate work in economics.  The stuff you will learn from this class is cool and interesting.  Be ready to work hard, but put in an effort to learn the material and you will do well.</comment>This class has a lot of work. But it isn't as difficult as people like to make it seem.</comment>good</comment>Make sure your TF is really good at explaining the material.</comment>Just make sure to really stay on top of the material. I don't think I got a good handle on it until the final exam, and as a result, I didn't get as much out of doing the problem sets as I should have.</comment>Section is very helpful; ask all the questions you want in section! If you truly feel you are learning nothing from lecture, don't waste your time. Take advantage of sections and do problem sets and you should be okay. Also, only 1 midterm!</comment>I was kind of ambivalent towards this class. It wasn't too difficult, sometimes I felt like I spent more time trying to figure out stata than the actual problem set.</comment></course>BBS 330: Critical Thinking and Research Proposal Writing</title>The class is nice because you get to write your PQE and get feedback from classmates and instructors. It can be difficult depending on which students are in your group and who runs your section.</comment>The course is useful in that it forces you to start your PQE proposal well in advance. Overall, the feedback from PIs and students was helpful in highlighting portions of your proposal which may not be clear. However, I don't think this class is absolutely necessary.</comment>The course is useful and motivates you to think about your PQE before it is too late; however, be prepared to work hard! Depending on whose section you are assigned to, the feedback and discussion may be more or less helpful than other sections'.</comment>If you can take a different class with a proposal writing component and have it count for BBS330, definitely do it.</comment>very useful, but it depends on your section.</comment>It forces you to write a proposal and gives you a deadline. It makes it less intimidating since you know it's just a first, or second draft. It was a useful exercise. But other aspects of the course (e.g. reading papers, writing critiques) is a lot of work!</comment>It is useful in that it forces you to work on your PQE very early, but the inflexible deadlines make it unnecessarily stressful. Also, being assigned to random sections limits the scientific feedback you receive on your proposal.</comment>Try to get out of this class at any cost.</comment>It may help you think about your project early, but expectations for constructive criticism should be low. The best assistance you can get is from post docs or fellow students in the same program that truly care about your project and progress. Students and faculty that do not have anything invested in you will not help as much.</comment>Nothing.</comment>The class was well-intended, but I think I didn't get as much out of it as I hoped.</comment>You should already have a draft or at least an outline of a potential research project to get the most out of BBS330.</comment>Hold out, like the BIG students.</comment>Convince the BBS program to drop this course as a requirement before it's too late!!!</comment>Great feedback on PQE aims from faculty.</comment></course>SPANSH 59: Spanish and the Community</title>This class is incredible because it draws together a wonderful and passionate group of students. The conversations you can have in this class are amazing--and the readings and videos are very interesting. The 4 hours of community service each week hugely adds to the amount of time this class takes up (and really will take up at least 4 hours each week!), making the hours/week of this class much higher than most Spanish classes (because you still have readings, movies, essays on top of that). That said, this class is TOTALLY worth it and more time-consuming (in a very worthwhile way) than stressful! It is definitely my favorite Spanish class I've taken at Harvard and you won't regret the amazing conversations and friendships you form. The community service component is also amazing, and in the end I really felt like I had a much deeper understanding than I ever would have thought possible of "Spanish and the Community." Be prepared to put in a bit of time, but if you do, you'll have a great experience!</comment>The class is great. Make sure you are willing to commit to the community service. My experience was valuable, but very difficult. Thinking and communicating in Spanish for four hours at a time is difficult and exhausting, Make sure you're ready for that component. That's not an issue grade-wise, but to do the kind of job you want to do with the people you'll be working with, make sure your Spanish is good enough. The class discussion was great. Essays were reasonable with interesting topics. There was not a big focus on grammar, for better or for worse. That didn't bother me, but this is not the class for you if you're looking to drill down your grammar. The class really improved my spoken Spanish.</comment>Do the classwork! It's so fun and complements the community service work.</comment>Spanish 59 is amazing class- for people like me, who can't seem to find time to do community service in their free time but really would like to, this class is perfect. The service is really meaningful and has the added benefit of improving your Spanish!</comment>I have no regrets taking this course, as the course material is extremely thorough while the volunteer work is fulfilling and engaging to the utmost degree. The only potential concern I would highlight is that this course will take a little more time than you expect. Volunteer work + readings and assignments can add up in terms of time, leaving you spending more time on this course than all other Spanish course of a similar level. Still would recommend with enthusiasm if you have the time.</comment>The community service component is what really helps to solidify your comfort with the language.</comment>A wonderful class that provides the perfect mix of theory and practice. Volunteering with the Spanish-speaking community of Cambridge was one of the most fulfilling experiences of my college career. Alberto is a pleasure to be around, and I hope he teaches the class in the future!</comment></course>GREEK 201: Reading Greek</title>If you need to take the Classics PhD general exams or you are a glutton for punishment, this course is for you.</comment></course>ROM-STD 201: Questions of Theory</title>If you believe that studying literature is a matter of thinking (better: of learning in order to think deeply) this is the best course that you can imagine!</comment>If you already have a background in theory, Schnapp and Hamilton's erudite insights will be really helpful to you and their innovative approach will help you connect thinkers around issues through time. If you have no theoretical background, this is a tough first class to take.</comment></course>MCB 294: Interesting Questions in Engineering and Physical Biology</title>This class is a great way to meet faculty and talk to them in a small group about their research. Take advantage of this- come prepared with questions, and try to encourage discussion.</comment>It is what you make of it. There is only really one assignment at the end, and you get a chance to interact with lots of great professors.</comment>It's a pressure-free way of gaining exposure to a wide range of research topics</comment>Great class. Can have some bad weeks if the specific lecturer isn't good, but overall the speakers chosen were quite engaging and interesting.</comment></course>ECON 2035: Psychology and Economic Theory</title>Matthew Rabin has devoted a lot of time over the years to make the course what it is nowadays. For anyone who wants to understand the theory of behavior economics, this is probably the best course you can take in the world.   The strengths of the course are: - The material. Just look at the syllabus, it's pretty amazing. - Matthew is fantastic but it took me a while to like him. I believe it is mostly because of the 3-hour lectures. It is impossible to like any teacher after a 3-hour class about theory. Still, he is very devoted to his students and very generous with his time. I look forward to developing my relationship with him in the coming years. - The problem sets! They are so well-written. I learnt so much from them. These are the best problem sets I have ever had in a class. You devote a lot of time to them but you learn an incredible amount of intuition and modeling skills from them, just by observing how Matthew writes the questions.  - The TA! Neil is absolutely fantastic. If it hadn't been for his office hours, I would have been in a lot of trouble to finish the problems (more trouble than I already went through.) I really hope he TAs the class next year because I am suggesting this class to a lot of my friends. - The number of office hours that both Matthew and Neil had during the semester: I was surprised that the class had no sections but that was perfect for the way how Matthew ran the class. We really needed office hours rather than sections.  The weaknesses of the course are: - I would appreciate if Matthew put some thought in the following issue: would students learn better if we had 2 1.5-hour classes a week or should we keep the current class schedule? - Also, the time of the class was very unfortunate. A lot of students took Raj Chetty's Public Economics class and they had to cross the river without having lunch to attend class. Public and behavior are two very common concentrations, so it is important to keep that in mind when choosing the time for the lecture.  - I would say that people should have a background in theory, which I totally did not have, before taking this class.</comment>This is not a good course to choose to satisfy the distribution requirement - while the material can be interesting, the problem sets devolve into unnecessarily frustrating algebra.</comment>- great professor with a lot of enthusiasm, knowledge, and devotion to his students. - great materials that everyone in any field, theory or empirical, should know. - excellent teaching fellow Neil Thakral.</comment>Problem sets are hard, but certainly worthwhile in terms of insight gained. Would recommend the lectures to anyone, even those not taking for credit.</comment>Matthew identifies behavioral biases and offers tractable ways to model them. You could build an entire career from applying the models you learn in this class to a wide range of fields. I highly recommend taking this class even if you don't view yourself as a behavioral economist.</comment>Behavioral Economics with emphasis on theory taught by one of the best scholars in the field.</comment></course>FRSEMR 25k: You Are What You Eat</title>Take this course - but only if you're genuinely interested in nutrition. It has very light course work, ideal for a freshman trying to get their footing at a new university. And I loved the discussions, but if you don't enjoy talking about food, you'll be bored to tears. Also, there are lots of guest speakers.</comment>The professor is very knowledgable, and it is a good tutorial on nutrition science.</comment>Literally No work required, and you learn some cool stuff.</comment>This class has very little to do with cooking. It is more of a nutrition class than a cooking class.</comment>Fascinating course that teaches you everything you need to know about making informed nutrition decisions.</comment>If you like nutrition this course will give you the opportunity to hear a lot of interesting things from great guest speakers.</comment>This is the seminar to take.  Great class dynamic and teacher.  Not much work and great speakers.</comment>This course is so special and important. I think everyone should be required to take a nutrition course at some point in their lives. You will learn things in this course that are important for the rest of your life.</comment></course>COMPSCI 61: Systems Programming and Machine Organization</title>I think 61 is a great class, but don't take it unless you have sufficient time/energy to devote to it. Learning the material last minute is particularly difficult, and trying to finish problem sets last minute or do well on the (very difficult but curved) exams without really knowing what's going on can be demoralizing</comment>Don't take this as a senior; take it earlier in your career. Simply because you might feel frustrated taking a large, intro course your senior fall.</comment>Take this class, take this class, take this class, TAKE THIS CLASS. If you are remotely thinking about doing anything CS at all, TAKE THIS CLASS. Even if you aren't sure you want to do CS, TAKE THIS CLASS. This class is amazing. Eddie is amazing. I would put a 6 as a rec if I could.</comment>Fantastic class. Professor is super energetic and helpful. Psets are fun and you'll learn a ton. This course taught me so much about the low level aspects of computers.</comment>Make sure you have lots of free time to put in working on the psets.</comment>It's the best class I've taken so far at Harvard! Eddie is an amazing teacher, and the coursework is super interesting.</comment>If your CS50 is your only computer science experience, make sure you have enough time to dedicate to this course for the semester. The course material is very interesting; having the time to understand it fully makes it even more rewarding and less stressful.</comment>I LOVED this class. I was feeling really burnt out and kind of lost within CS but this class showed me why I chose this concentration in the first place. The tests seem basically IMPOSSIBLE but they test something that every real programmer should have: resourcefulness. If you are smart about your time and know what information will help you, you'll do just fine. The problem sets are super awesome and while difficult, are not impossible. By the end, you'll feel incredibly satisfied and be a C master. I cannot recommend this class enough. The teaching staff is incredible and Eddie is a god. He cares so much about his students and is willing to break things down like you're five (which I definitely needed at points). TAKE THIS CLASS!</comment>Worth it</comment>This class is AMAZING!!! It will take over your life in every way and you will become a slave to it. . .  but you will fall in love with CS and it is completely worth it. Eddie Kohler is an INCREDIBLE teacher -- get to know him if you take this course. He is absolutely hilarious and wonderful and truly a genius. Also, choose a pset partner who you want to become best friends with -- you will be spending a huge amount of time with them and will probably want to kill them otherwise. But seriously, this class is the best thing to happen to CS at Harvard TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT.</comment>If you want to dive in to the nitty grity of a computer, I would totally take this course! However, if you are looking at Computer Science from a higher perspective, I'm not sure if this is the most useful thing to take. Make sure that you recognize the importance of a good partner early on. Think about who you would want to partner with on the first pset and reach out to them early.</comment>This is a very difficult class. But you will learn a lot. It is very worthwhile, and at the end of the day, you will be a much better programmer.</comment>Eddie is the best lecturer I've had so far at Harvard. This class is a lot of work, but it's really rewarding. Make sure you find a partner early on (when you're allowed to have partners on the psets), and make sure you have enough time in your schedule to really invest in this class. It's so worthwhile but only if you put in the (extensive) time and effort needed to do well in this class, something I learned too late in the semester.</comment>The class is phenomenal and Kohler is one of the best professors you'll meet. The material is difficult but rewarding and the class is totally survivable.</comment>Well worth the struggle to understand how your computer works on a deeper level.</comment>Really good introduction to systems programming. A lot of the experience has to do with your partner so choose well. Some of the problem sets take more time than others, be careful! Tests are very tricky, would take good notes and familiarize yourself with the source code.</comment>This is a rather challenging but very rewarding course. You will see everything under the hood of the magic box. The reasons for apparently strange things like pointers and the sizes of integers will be made clear to you. And then you will be introduced to newer and stranger concepts that will significantly increase your appreciation of the work that has gone into making the modern computing environment, as well as understanding a bit more about what can go wrong~ (1337 h4xx0r5!)</comment>TAKE IT!</comment>This is not CS 50. It's better though.</comment>It takes some work, but it's an engaging course and I learned a lot.</comment>I have now taken CS 50, 51, 121, and 61 in the CS department, and CS 61 was (by far) the hardest of those courses. At the same time, the level of depth in this course is unparalleled among CS classes I've taken. CS 61 delves very deep into a lot of important issues (file I/O, kernel programming, assembly, etc.) and empowers students to write very powerful code. (For instance, by the end of this course, you can program file I/O systems that can beat stdio in most cases; implement the ability to create new processes in a simple operating system; and write a simple garbage collector that eliminates much of the inconvenience of having to free memory in C.) After this course, you will feel like an excellent programmer. Eddie is also an excellent instructor; he is funny and engaging, and he is clearly very enthusiastic about the subject matter and about teaching.

This class is not easy by any means (at least not for me). I spent less time on it than I should have, and ended up doing poorly on many psets as a result. But if you are willing to put in a lot of work and don't have a terribly hard course schedule, you can probably manage it well. All in all, if you are willing to work hard, you will learn a TON from this class and come out of it feeling like you have accomplished truly remarkable things. Take this class!!!</comment>It's challenging, but very rewarding and good to experience Eddie!</comment>Take it! Definitely worth it to round out the 50/51 series. Eddie is also an amazing lecturer, so if you typically find yourself falling asleep in other cs courses, take this one, because that won't happen!</comment>Eddie's enthusiasm is contagious! He really made me appreciate the nuts and bolts of what goes on in a computer when it runs programs, and I think this knowledge is essential for a computer science education. You really only need to have taken CS50 to take CS61, but for me having extra programming experience definitely helped. The problem sets are difficult at times, and they're definitely time-consuming, but I found some to be quite fun. The course was pretty organized this year, but the midterm & final are still hard- but it's hard for every student basically. Definitely take this class at some point in your undergrad time if you're a CS major!</comment>It was a hard, but rewarding class. Problem sets take forever, but you learn a lot and it's always interesting and fun working on them, so you don't notice the hours as much. Lectures are engaging. And the material is really cool.</comment>IT'S REALLY HARD.</comment>It is a very challenging course, though you learn a LOT and Eddie is a wonderful lecturer. Despite the fact that the course kicked my butt, it was a great experience and I have grown tremendously as a problem solver. Not for the faint of heart, but definitely consider this class if you are interested in the inner workings of your computer!</comment>This is a very good class, and I definitely recommend you take it. Eddie Kohler is very funny and engaging, the pests are interesting and fun, and the material is really cool.</comment>This class is a great intro to learning how a computer actually works! You learn to appreciate how fascinating and complex the machine you're staring at right now actually is.</comment>Take it 80% for the material and 100% for Eddie Kohler. 180% is also indicative of how much time and effort you should expect to put into the psets.</comment>Find a pset partner early. This class really requires you to work collaboratively with that partner, so be familiar with git basics. The psets are super time-consuming but totally worth your effort, plus you get to say that you coded up a primitive shell, or dynamic memory allocator, or teensy weensy operating system, which is always cool. I would brush up on C programming skills before heading into this class if you're not feeling completely comfortable, or at least be super comfortable with the level of C taught in CS50. Be open-minded - some of the systems programming concepts might appear foreign to you as it did to me but Prof Kohler is so clear and vivid with his explanations that it makes the material fun to learn and easy to pick up.</comment>Take this at your own risk! It is difficult and will require a lot of time, but if you get through it, it is the most rewarding feeling.</comment>This is an incredible course!  Prof. Kohler is a great, engaging professor and you'll leave the course with a really solid footing in systems programming.  The material is also essential for any one who wants to code seriously, even those who are only interested in higher-level stuff.</comment>CS61 with Professor Kohler is a fantastic class.  Although the first few lectures are a bit slow because students come in with so many different background levels, they're still worth attending because the professor is engaging, funny, and really good at explaining concepts in simple, memorable ways (and at staging hilarious demos!).  The impression I got throughout the semester is that Professor Kohler is just genuinely incredibly excited about anything systems programming-related, and his excitement is infectious.

The problem sets are challenging and definitely needed to be started early, but they're also extremely interesting and are structured in such a way that you feel an incredible sense of accomplishment after completing each one - you defused a (binary) bomb!  You built an entire OS!  I also appreciated how skillfully the logistics were handled - I never felt that we were being given an unfair amount of work or that I wasn't receiving timely feedback.

Lastly, you won't need to read the textbook if you attend lectures, but CS:APP2e is really good as far as textbooks go - clear and comprehensive without ever being simplistic.</comment>This is a great class, and it really goes in depth about CS at the low-level. Eddie's such an amazing lecturer, and the psets are hard but worth it! Take the class!!!</comment>If Eddie is teaching it, definitely taking it. Otherwise it depends on whether or not you liked the low-level part of cs50</comment>This class was a highlight to my first semester.  The concepts are challenging at times and some of the psets, especially the first couple can be daunting, but you learn a ton and Eddie is really enthusiastic and inspiring.</comment>Kohler is a great lecturer, the material he teaches is really interesting, and every problem set presents a new and interesting range of problems in a fun way.</comment>This was an excellent course in every way. I learned a lot, I became both more skilled with systems and learned about how to code well. The course staff was excellent, and Eddie is an awesome professor. He shows awesome enthusiasm, and this class revived my faith in live-coding during lectures.</comment>This class was difficult but ultimately rewarding. I learned so much; Eddie is a great lecturer and managed to pack a lot of content into each hour and a half. The problem sets were difficult, and some were quite time-intensive, but I truly feel like I became a much better programmer because of this course. That said, I wasn't particularly interested in the content going in and figured it would grow on me. I think my lack of genuine interest made me a little more reluctant to devote as much time to the class as it undoubtedly deserved.</comment>CS61 was really hard. The psets were difficult and the midterm/final were possibly some of the hardest exams I've taken at Harvard. You definitely learn a lot though!

Looking back, I shouldn't have taken the class (did not have enough interest in the material), but I know a lot of other people who loved the class!</comment>You should really only take this course if you are legitimately interested in systems programming. I am not, and took this class anyway because I love math and programming, and I ended up not enjoying it very much.</comment>This class is fantastic, but a LOT of work. Eddie is by far the best professor I have ever had, and he is so patient with everyone. The material is really interesting, but it is very difficult. I am not a CS concentrator, and having only taken 50 and 51, I really struggled with a lot of this stuff. I know that some people were much better prepared than I was, but I accepted this large disparity in knowledge. You will learn so much cool stuff about how computers work, and the high to low level connections are so rewarding to understand. My one regret is that I simply didn't have enough time to dedicate to this class. If you take this class, make sure you have room in your schedule to work about 20 hours a week on the material.</comment>CS61 feels like the first real computer science class I've taken at Harvard. It's a lot of work, and the exams are brutal, but I'm a far, far better programmer than I was when the class began. You'll learn things about computers that you've always taken for granted, which is an awesome feeling. Take it and enjoy it; Eddie is a fantastic professor and you'll be in good company with him.</comment>CS61 teaches you what really goes on in your computer, and covers a lot of ground -- OS, shell, networks/concurrency, bitwise ops, assembly, etc. It's hard, but definitely doable and the psets are a lot of fun!  Exams are ridiculously hard, but even if you fail them, you come out of this class having learned a ton, which was one of the greatest feelings ever.</comment>While at times the material was not what I can see myself digging even further into of my own interest, the course is so well taught under Professor Kohler that it is very much worth it.</comment>Eddie is a fantastic teacher that knows how to walk the fine line between challenging his students to take learning into their own hands and giving his students enough guidance and resources to make as much progress as quickly as possible. It will likely take a long time outside of class to fully understand the material unless you already have a solid understanding of C programming and systems fundamentals. That said, it is very rewarding to dig deeply into the material and understand what is really going on at the heart of many things you use every day. And if you grasp the material more quickly than others, there is no shortage to how you can extend concepts and further challenge yourself on psets with extra credit opportunities.</comment>Definitely take this class! Eddie is the best professor I've had so far at Harvard - his lectures are really interesting and applicable, and he's just a hilarious and great guy in general. It definitely takes a lot of work but you learn a lot doing them, and get to see the way a bunch of systems that we take for granted actually work. It's a great way to see if you like backend/systems type work, and even if you end up not liking that type of CS, it's super relevant information.</comment>Amazing class. You'd be a fool to concentrate in CS and not take it -- challenging in all the right ways, Kohler's the man. Teaching staff is phenomenal.</comment>For those of you remotely interested in the material, the course is excellent and you can take it pass/fail. Its a hard course nonetheless but the material is awesome. Makes you a better programmer. Seriously, the course is tough but there are so many cool things about the material and Eddie is awesome.</comment>Eddie Kohler is one of, if not the best, CS professors at Harvard. He has a way of explaining concepts that is hilarious, memorable, and intuitive. Systems is actually not one of my favorite areas of CS, but since Prof Kohler was teaching it, I would rank this class as one of my favorites here. Now if only I had actually gone to lecture in person instead of cramming the videos in before the psets...</comment>This class is a MUST-TAKE if you're anywhere near the CS department. For concentrators, worth making space in your sophomore fall rather than waiting. Try to do this and 121 together.</comment>This is quite possibly one of the best CS courses I've taken at Harvard.  NOTE: It is significantly harder than 50 and 61, but Eddie and the Staff help you to adjust to the difficulty.  Be prepared to spend a decent amount of time on the psets and make sure you have a good partner (don't just pick a good friend, pick someone who is good to work with).  The exams are tough, and I don't think you can guarantee you'll get an A, but the material itself is fascinating and Eddie is simply AMAZING.</comment>This class is both very useful and very painful. In retrospect glad I took it, and I'm excited about the concepts we learned. I do feel like it's not really my "thing," and it might not be yours, either. The course is well-organized and Eddie Kohler is fantastic, but it's still very possible to get absolutely lost.</comment>This class is awesome. Eddie is great and a super engaging lecturer. If you liked the C component of CS50, you'll love CS61.</comment>Take it if Eddie is teaching it! He's A++. He's hilarious (check out his Twitter) and genuinely cares about the topic/making sure students know the material. It's slightly intimidating talking to him, but after your conversation with him, I guarantee you will understand the material much better. This is a class where the professor cares that you're learning the material and not memorizing it.</comment>This is a great class that does teach you a lot about systems. Eddie is a fantastic instructor who, as a systems expert, is great at presenting code-based lectures. However, run-of-the-mill CS students will have a really tough time in this class. A lot of people take this class as a requirement, but many take it because it's a fun side class for them, and so while less experienced students (i.e. those who took CS50 and 51 and had no prior experience) are struggling through assignments, other people treat the psets as fun little brain-teasers that don't take too much effort. You can go to all the office hours you want without feeling like you're actually making progress in the course. Options for help in this course are very limited, and if you can't figure out a certain part of a pset, there's a big chance you'll get stuck and won't be able to finish it. You can still get something out of the class, but the experience will be pretty difficult.</comment>To put things in perspective, I only took CS50 prior to this course. The course is hard in the sense that you see quite a bit of new systems-level concepts and you have to apply them. There is a very good support structure for getting you started. Most of my issues stemmed from poor assumptions on my part about how something works - the actual programming of problem sets is not that difficult as the lectures, sections, and problem set spec do a great job of guiding you along the way. You can do the problem sets with a partner which makes things easier. I worked alone (keep in mind, I'm no experienced programmer) and still found the work load to be very manageable if you stay on top of things and do not procrastinate everything until the last minute.</comment>This is an awesome class and you will learn a lot, but make sure you enjoy programming and are willing to work hard, otherwise you will probably be unhappy with the amount of work required to do well.</comment>Eddie is one of the best teachers I've had at Harvard. His lectures are relevant and engaging, and he puts a huge amount of personal energy into helping students. Not all professors are as engaged with the students and material of a class as he is. He really cares, and as a result even when the material was difficult I never really felt overwhelmed. The problem sets are also really well structured.</comment>The class becomes much easier if you do it with a partner, though you may not learn as much.</comment>Easily the best class I've taken at harvard so far. Eddie makes this class fun but tough. He listens to the students to make sure if it is getting too ridiculous, to give you a few hints to help you along your way. I looked forward to every single lecture and assignment. This class is not easy, but totally worth it.</comment>This is the most difficult CS class I've taken. In fact, the most difficult class I've taken ever (just finished Sophomore fall). That being said, I highly, highly recommend this class. You learn a lot about how a computer system works as you learn programming on a lower abstraction level. You definitely come out of the class as a stronger programmer.</comment>Take this course! It is so much better than the two intro courses - you feel like you're learning all the time, lectures are incredibly engaging, and Eddie is a skillful teacher. Finishing the problem sets is rewarding when you look at what you built, especially since it's no longer just "fill in the blanks" and you have to do some design alongside the coding.</comment>This class is a good follow-up to CS50. It's harder, but not unreasonable. A good partner is very helpful for the assignments. Exams are difficult, but then the staff hands out partial credit like it's candy.</comment>While I think the subject matter of this course is very important, and Eddie is a great professor who really cares about his students, I don't think I got as much out of this course as I usually do in CS classes, especially given the amount of time I put into it.</comment>This will be one of the harder classes in your schedule, if not the hardest. You have two weeks per problem set, but those two weeks are given for a reason. You'll find yourself struggling a lot if you procrastinate.</comment>Lectures are well-planned, clear, and engaging. The problem sets are really well-designed, and working through them is a fun, challenging, and rewarding experience. Professor Kohler is also one of the best professors I've had at Harvard!</comment>This was a fun course. Especially the assembly assignment.</comment>This is a butt-kicking course. The systems knowledge covered is absolutely fundamental to any computer scientist, and you'll learn how seemingly small changes to your code can make it much more efficient. But the process in getting there is also butt-kicking, and there's a lot more struggling involved than one might originally anticipate. Overall, you'll work a lot to learn a lot.</comment>Make sure you don't fall behind on the material! Ask questions until you fully understand everything. If you don't, the exams will be the death of you in this course, since they have an ability to weed out those details in the course material that you thought were irrelevant in the larger scope of things. It is possible to complete the psets understanding the function of and general ideas of some concepts without fully understanding the mechanisms that make them work, which again, will be tested in the exams.</comment>This class's main focus is to make you a better programmer.  You learn a bit about the way low-level parts of computers work along the way, but you'll overall spend a lot of your time figuring out how to handle complex coding projects.  It also makes you a lot better at debugging.  Professor Kohler is an amazing person; you should take the class just so you can experience his teaching and get to know him.</comment>This is a great introduction to systems programming. Professor Kohler is hilarious, and I definitely feel that I know a lot more about C and how computers actually work than I did before. Being able to even think about the systems level was very useful for interviews that I was doing this fall.

It's a fairly different perspective on programming in terms of how to manage resources and get code to run faster and how the computer actually interprets what you're telling it to do  -- I highly recommend it for anyone who's interested in working in CS long term.</comment>Thank you, Eddie, for restoring my faith in CS. So glad I took this course–you learn super cool material that feels very much applicable to the "real world" situations, and being taught by the amazingly hilarious, engaging, and devoted professor like Eddie certainly didn't hurt.</comment>It's really great to take a CS class on levels of programming you take for granted. I love CS classes that are less "learn to program good for a job" and more like a humanities class, in the sense that you study "why things are the way they are". I learned a huge amount and Eddie is amazingly funny and nice and smart. Obviously, its a lot of work but that shouldn't bother a CS concentrator, YOU CHOSE THIS LIFESTYLE.</comment>TAKE IT!! If I end up working in some sort of programming job, it will be because I took this class.</comment>Eddie Kohler is a fantastic professor. He brings so much energy and enthusiasm to the classroom and the subject matter, it's infectious. The problem sets for this class are great (but of course quite time-consuming). Just be aware that the exams are notoriously difficult and even with a lot of preparation can be pretty rough. Still, I absolutely loved this class. It will make you a better programmer, and you'll really learn C.</comment>A hard but essential class.  Eddie is the best!</comment>I didn't know C at all upon entering this class, and I have gotten by so far. The first 3 psets are ok, but the next 3 are rough. Midterm average was around a 70.</comment>This is a great class but requires a lot of work.  The problem sets are tricky but rewarding.</comment>Actually a fascinating topic. The psets are challenging but extremely rewarding, and it's a great warmup if you plan to eventually take 161. Lecture is good but only helpful if you already have a basic understanding of the material. Otherwise Eddie's examples may go over your head. Go to section, and the section notes and examples are really helpful for getting the major concepts. Overall, highly recommended!</comment>This is the best class you will ever take at Harvard. If you are serious about computer science, you have to take this class. Learning systems programming will make you a better computer scientist in every way--no matter your specialty. If you aren't a computer scientist, you should still take this class because it teaches you a way of thinking that is useful for every field. Kohler is a fantastic professor as well!</comment></course>EXPOS 20.231: Sports and the Law</title>It is a great class</comment>Sports and the Law is an amazing class. Fobi is one of the most interesting teachers I have met and has such a broad knowledge base. Don't just take it if you play sports. If you like to play sports but couldn't care less about legal issues in sports like Title IX and contracts, then you might want to think about looking elsewhere.</comment>DEFINITELY TAKE THIS CLASS! A lot of people I know don't like their Expos class, but everyone I know in Sports and the Law really likes it! We were never overburdened with work or readings, and all of our assignments were interesting. I liked that Brian Fobi wasn't too picky about sources, which gave me a lot of liberty to research a complicated topic for my last essay, which I really enjoyed writing!</comment>best expos course at the school</comment>Definitely take this class! The discussions you have are engaging and transcend the world of sports and law. Y</comment>Best class I've taken hands down. Brian is the man!</comment>Readings are easier as compared to other literature readings</comment>Brian Fobi is the best Expos Preceptor ever.  If you have any interest in either sports and/or the law, take this course.  It is the best Expos 20 course on the market, and you will become a better writer as a result of it while simultaneously having a great time.</comment>This is one of the best Expos classes you can take. The preceptor is phenomenal and the work load is lighter than most other classes.</comment>Absolutely take this Expos if you get it.  Fobi is an awesome preceptor and is is very flexible when it comes to deadlines and assignments.  Readings in the beginning start off pretty slow but the majority of the readings are not necessary, as we mostly discuss current events in sports.  The essays are straightforward and he basically outlines what you need to say in order to get a good grade in the class.  There are no extra response papers that other Expos classes have. Definitely take it!!!</comment>This was my favorite class this semester for many reasons. I loved the topics discussed, I found I had a lot in common with my classmates who became some of my best friends, and I really enjoyed the professor. He understands and relates to Harvard undergraduates better than any professor I have met.</comment>Very very good class - Brian Fobi is fantastic!</comment>This is an amazing class that you will not regret taking. Definitely the most enjoyable Expos class this year.</comment></course>EXPOS 10.015: Introduction to Expository Writing</title>This class certainly helps to transition those who may not have such strong writing backgrounds, into the college writing atmosphere.</comment>Although it might seem like many other people aren't taking Expos 10, the truth is there is. Expos 10 is a great introductory course that establishes a strong or stronger writing foundation as you prepare to go into Expos 20. In my opinion, you cannot go wrong with taking this course.</comment>It is very useful in that it helps to develop your own style of writing</comment>Actually but yourself into the writing.</comment>Come to class every day prepared for the discussions. They can be very helpful in helping you develop arguments for your papers.</comment></course>AFRAMER 90r.m: Somali</title>I would recommend the ALP to my peers, but not the particular Somali instructor.</comment></course>RUSS Aab: Elementary Russian (Intensive)</title>A great class--hard to believe how much one can learn in just one semester!</comment>The course is out of this world. Natalia Georgievna is the most fabulous instructor I have had.   A few things you would want to know: the course will take a lot of time and commitment, so you will want to have that time and interest in learning Russian. If you have both, taking the class will be the best thing you did.   The course has an emphasis on grammar and exposes a wealth of information in an extremely clear fashion. This is invaluable as a basis to build vocabulary on, so I felt the course mentality was right on. The material is great and very original; I've never seen course materials quite like it.  Also the course has (in addition to the morning sessions) a speaking session three times a week: they are so well taught, and make the course truly special.  Russian is a hard language: the grammar is tough, and getting to make it spontaneous enough for oral is difficult. Be prepared for a challenge; I will not hide that having a previous exposure does help.  But overall if you want to go through the experience, I greatly recommend the course.</comment>This class doesn't require a background in Russian—but it does require a lot of motivation, and the discipline to follow with one of the fastest moving courses I've encountered. But there's no teacher more equipped to help you learn Russian than Natalia Georgievna, who is spectacularly effective and encouraging. Definitely the best learning experience I have had at Harvard, or ever.</comment></course>MATH 55a: Honors Abstract Algebra</title>Problem sets form the backbone of this course. Unless you're among the tiny percentage of people who find all the problem sets easy, do make sure to work with other people. The class will be extremely rewarding if you do so, and potentially coma-inducing if you don't.</comment>This class is awesomely challenging but also enlightening. It is the best introduction to college math I could have asked for.</comment>Perhaps evaluate niche individual skills</comment>This is going to be hard, but probably worth it.</comment>It's Math 55. It's an incredible class, but be prepared to be challenged.</comment>This course with Gaitsgory is amazing.  If you are willing to work hard and passionate about the material, you should take it.</comment>Gaitsgory is the man.</comment>If you're reading this, you're probably wondering whether this course is right for you. While obviously not for everyone, I got so much out of this course, it's almost difficult to believe. I am so much better at math, so much better equipped to take on the rest of math here at Harvard (or anywhere, basically) than I was at the beginning of the year.

I didn't go to MOP, I didn't even qualify for USAMO - these are not requirements. If you're willing to dedicate 30 hours a week to math, and that sounds like a great use of a semester to you, then you really should take this course. Just do it. DO IT.

(I want to use this space to dispel the rumor I heard while deciding to take this course that Math 55 take SIXTY HOURS a week to complete the psets. I spent nowhere close to this amount of time, and I was among the slower people in the class in this respect.)</comment>Gaitsgory is easily the best teacher I've ever had. I wasn't a big fan of representation theory personally, and would have preferred something else. However, it is an important subject to learn at some point, so I can't really complain. Even if you've come in with a reasonable amount of background in all the topics 55 is supposed to cover, the class is worth taking. It forces you to think about everything more abstractly, and gives a better understanding of everything at a fundamental level. I'd absolutely recommend the class to anyone who's interested in math.</comment>The course goes really fast. Great part of the course is about you learning by yourself, while lectures give you only a guideline. The course is all about abstraction to the extent that it lacks concreteness.</comment>Don't be scared by the reputation of Math 55. The course is hard and you will spend many hours on the problem sets, but it's not impossible and will not eat your life away. In particular, prior experience with abstract math is not necessary; Professor Gaitsgory does a great job of taking you from knowing basically nothing to having a decent grasp of linear algebra and group theory. If you think you can do it, try it out for a few weeks and don't worry too much about your grade or the workload; you will be pleasantly surprised. Also, go to office hours. You will get your questions cleared up and Prof. Gaitsgory occasionally gives out hints/solutions to homework problems.</comment>If you really love math, and have been years ahead of normal math curricula, this course will absolutely meet your intellectual demands. It is very challenging; be prepared to work 40 hours or more if you aren't already very familiar with the material. Overall, completely worth it though - nowhere else can you learn so much material in one class.</comment>For the first 3 weeks I thought I was still shopping the course, thinking that I would eventually drop to 25. In the 6th week I realized that I was taking 55. It is a hard course, but not unreasonably so. Work hard, learn math.</comment>First of all: the workload for this class is overhyped by a factor of at least 5. Every person I talked to consistently reported spending 5-10 hours per PSet. This is less time than I am forced to spend on my Expos essay. Moreover, it is hard to not finish with an A.

If you are competent with proofs and are interested in math then I strongly recommend this class. After taking 55a you will have enough background to begin learning a lot of higher math on your own. You will know what a module is, what a wedge product is, what a short exact sequence is, what the Jordan decomposition is, and so on and so forth. Moreover, Gaitsgory genuinely cares about making sure the students understand the material and practically begs students to come to office hours.

I do suggest having someone to talk to that has seen the material before; the lectures move quite rapidly and often don't include bits of intuition or motivation that would otherwise make things much clearer.</comment></course>PSY 2170: Developmental Proseminar</title>best learning experience thus far in graduate school</comment>This is a great class regardless of your subarea-- the faculty plan out their lectures so that themes and questions return again and again throughout the term. Any students interested in core knowledge and learning will get a lot out of the class. Keep up with the reading and you'll be okay.</comment>This course, while extremely interesting and useful, had an absurd amount of reading assigned (up to ~250 pages of highly technical journal articles some weeks), and this strongly detracts from the course's overall usefulness and enjoyability.</comment>It was rewarding to meet every week and talk with extremely knowledgeable and bright people about the big topics of cognitive sciences. It changed my way of thinking on the topic and increased my understanding of the big issues..</comment>Prepare for an unremitting whirlwind tour of developmental psychology.</comment></course>CHEM 17: Principles of Organic Chemistry</title>I liked Chem 17, the problem was, Chem 17 didn't like me.</comment>To everyone that has asked me about this course so far, I have said that it's definitely challenging and very educational. I feel that Harvard students tend to underestimate their peers (or overestimate their own ability) and opt for the more challenging option when available (Chem 20, in this case), but I am certain that even experienced chemistry students will find this course sufficiently difficult. I would definitely give all students a warning that they must be absolutely prepared to buckle down and work for many hours at a time. I want to emphasize how important it is to stay on top of the material; falling behind even slightly is a horrible, horrible thing. I've seen so many of my classmates fall asleep during one or two lectures and find it near impossible to figure out what's going on for the following month, if not for the rest of the course. That said, I thoroughly enjoyed Chem 17 and am so grateful to have had the privilege to take the course.</comment>This class is worth your time. Professor Jacobson and the whole staff are hugely helpful and supportive. They care about you learning Organic Chemistry. The organization is impeccable, and the structure is ideal for a skill based class like this(psets are just check/check + and used for learning and feedback only). That being said, Jacobson will not be teaching it next year, so it's impossible to say how all this will be continued.</comment>This is really not a bad class. The key to success in this class is time. I found that lectures were a bit dry. But make sure you understand all the problems!</comment>This is a great class if you are interested in science and chemistry.</comment>It's a requirement so you kinda have to suck it up and take it.  That said, while the calss was hard it wasn't as impossible as I thought it was going to be.  The TFs were all amazingly helpful, and Jacobson really cares about making the material accessible for everyone.  Steven's midterm review sessions were amazing.  Stay on top of the psets and do all the practice problems and you'll be fine.  If you can make this your only hard class in a semester, even better.

Also buying the textbook and molecular model kit are totally unnecessary.  save your money and just focus on understanding the practice problems.</comment>This is for people who haven't taken PS1 or PS11 yet- you can do it!! The first exam/beginning material will be more difficult because other people have already seen it, but as long as you put in the extra work at the beginning you will be totally fine! More generally, this class is actually really great even though orgo has a bad rep. It is well taught, well organized, and by the end you feel like you know a lot and have a good grasp on the material. It's just a fact that the material is hard and will take a lot of studying to get comfortable with. My biggest piece of advice is keep up on practice problems throughout the semester. The more problems you do the easier it gets.</comment>I'm not going to fill this space with a paragraph about how difficult this course is - it's organic chemistry. You already know it's going to be a challenge. The good news is, this is probably one of the best-taught courses I've taken at Harvard so far (as a junior engineering pre-med)! Professor Jacobsen is PHENOMENAL at being clear and concise during lecture, and all of the TFs are also super available during the course of the semester. They all collectively do an excellent job in making orgo very survivable. With that said, it's definitely up to YOU to take advantage of all of those resources. I can guarantee that you are not going to do that well if you don't go to office hours, the Friday review sessions, and also practice sufficiently on your own. Overall, I loved Chem 17 because it is a course in which you get out what you put in, which makes it a very rewarding experience if you play your cards right.</comment>Make use of all the materials the course offers. Practice makes perfect when it comes to reaction mechanisms and Prof. Jacobsen and the TFs make sure there are enough practice problems available for you. Just make sure to carve out time every day to practice. There is a huge difficulty spike towards the end of the course so make sure you have mastered all the material up to Week 9 or so when it arrives so you can spend most of your time on the more difficult material come Reading Period.</comment>Bad class to take, but necessary for organic chemistry requirements for concentrations or pre-meds. Really put in the time to do all of the practice problems and make sure you understand the key concepts that are emphasized over and over again in their course because those are the most important and you will definitely be tested on them.</comment>This class is AMAZING. One of the best classes I've taken at Harvard so far. I decided to take organic chemistry as an elective, since I've heard very good things about Chem 17 and that it teaches you a new way of thinking. And it really does. Jacobsen is a very good and passionate lecturer, and the teaching staff really offers so much help to ensure you understand the material. Organic chemistry really is not as scary as most people make it out to be, and I highly recommend anybody take this class!</comment>If you're premed or enjoy a mechanisms based approach to chem, take it</comment>If you're debating between Chem 17 and Chem 20, I think that Chem 17 does provide a pretty solid understanding of organic chem - Jacobsen is a great lecturer, and overall this course does build a solid, intuitive understanding of orgo. Friends of mine really enjoyed Chem 20 but often really disliked Chem 30, and I think the 17/27 sequence is not a "lesser" education than 20/30 - it just has a more biological and mechanistic focus.</comment>Be aware that PS11 will help you a lot throughout the course with the conceptual parts, but you can get away with taking Chem 17 without it. Be prepared to not understand a lot of the "little" conceptual things throughout the course. At the beginning of the year I hated this class but once you get to the mechanisms it can be fun at times, or as fun as orgo can be. This class wasn't much work week to week but depending on your study habits you could easily spend a week straight reviewing for a midterm so be ready for that.</comment>Organic chemistry is a difficult subject, but Chem 17 makes it somewhat manageable. Now this class is NOT easy, and unless you really like chemistry or it's a requirement, I might not suggest taking it. But if you're thinking of taking it, it's probably a requirement and I will have to say that I put a lot of time and effort into this class and still did okayish--that's how difficult this class can be. But from my experience with similarly difficult classes, I'll have to say that Chem 17 is very well-organized with a good support system that has made a difficult subject not seem too daunting to try to master. Professor Jacobsen is an amazing lecturer and he knows that orgo isn't easy and he doesn't pretend it is. And that's partly why he is so effective as a professor. And the TFs are definitely there for you and willing to help as much as you can. What it comes down to is what YOU do. I started this class not putting in as much effort as it deserved, and only when I started getting serious, did things get a lot better. I would suggest always looking over the material after every week (annotated slides, section handouts) and email your TF any questions or go to office hours. Do more practice problems than the ones done in section. Study really hard for the exams. If you do that, you'll likely come out learning a lot about orgo and not having too terrible of an experience from it. Good luck, but Chem 17 will definitely help you get through it.</comment>This class is difficult and very time consuming but it is well organized and well taught. Prof Jacobsen and the teaching staff offer a lot of support in terms of office hours and review sessions, and you should really, really take advantage of them. I definitely wish I had. Like everyone else says, the class is pretty hard, but you just need to be prepared to devote a lot of time to it. Try not to have an otherwise difficult course load if possible. Keep up with the work (seriously, don't fall behind, it 's so hard to catch up in this class), use the resources available to you, and give yourself plenty of time to do psets and prepare for exams. Practice problems are really good- do all of them the week you get them.</comment>Take this class only if you ABSOLUTELY need to. And be sure that you need to. Don't take this class if you are trying to decide if you're a life science of a psych concentrator. Because this class will make you a psych concentrator and will you screw your GPA in the process.</comment>Chem 17 is fantastic for teaching you the fundamentals of organic chemistry and how to apply them in a systematic manner, particularly in regards to Molecular Orbital theory. Early in the course, I was frustrated with how often we had to draw different orbitals and their interactions when I thought we were supposed to be learning interesting reactions. I still remember this moment of sudden clarity when I realized systematic MO theory could helped me understand just everything better. Why is the carbonyl oxygen protonated during acidic catalysis? Why is the more substituted alkene more stable? OHHHHH. This is the first great thing about this course. The second thing is how amazingly well prepared this course is. Professor Jacobsen is an experienced teacher who knows how to cover material at just the right depth to keep all levels of students interested. TFs are incredibly patient and helpful in addressing the generalizations in chemistry, especially Ania. Section handouts are the clearest, most succinct summary of lecture information I've ever seen. Section problems, psets, and exams are extremely well-written. They are fair and doable, but challenging enough to require an integration of various concepts that leave you proud of how much you've learned in this course.</comment>This is a great course to learn the basics of organic chemistry! Professor Jacobsen does a great job teaching you an intuitive sense of organic chemistry as well as simplifies complicated topics into easy to understand models. The TF's are all very motivated and dedicated to teaching and helping you understand the material too. Overall, I liked this class better than LS1A or PS11 because they explain things very well and don't waste your time with busy work or unnecessary ramblings. The best part about the class is that your grades is only based on midterm and final, which means you can focus on actual learning and no get bogged down by grades!</comment>The course self-perpetuated people's hatred for orgo. The class and the teaching staff were often very pessimistic on the course and their expectations (i.e. always saying things were going to be hard, challenging) and this is turn just made people more unhappy with the course and led to a lot more people giving up. This is really sad to see. Because orgo is such a cool course that has so much potential and I feel like sometimes this potential was shattered by the very people that teach the course. I wish there was a more positive atmosphere- it will make more people like orgo and make more people be willing to try.</comment>One of the most enjoyable courses I've taken! Very well taught and organized.</comment>It is great as long as you stay on top of the work and section problems.</comment>Come in with the mindset that you really want to learn and you'll be rewarded. Every week you'll walk out of lecture and section thinking that you'll never understand the material but you'll be surprised at how much you learn. That being said, MAKE SURE you do the practice problems before the midterms--a lot of questions are based on your ability to think quickly.</comment>Although this is a challenging course, at the end of it you will realize that you have learned a LOT over the course of the semester. The teaching staff is phenomenal, and they are definitely willing to help you along the way. My biggest advice is to DO ALL THE PRACTICE PROBLEMS. Practice is really the best way to learn the material--it's like learning another language. If you're willing to put in the work, this is definitely a manageable class!</comment>really not as bad as people made it out to be. Jacobsen is great, and sections also really help.</comment>Professor Jacobsen is a very good lecturer; although Orgo is definitely a very difficult subject and can be very hard to stay on top of sometimes, Jacobsen makes it as easy and as painless as possible.</comment>It is extremely hard and useless. Only take it if you have to for pre-med requirements.</comment>Make sure you don't fall behind, and work hard on the psets even though they aren't graded.</comment>The class is undoubtedly really hard, but required for pre-meds. Practice a lot and ask for help when you need it. Figure out who the good TFs are early -- some can be really unhelpful while others are always willing to help.</comment>It's very difficult because there was a lot of material and everything was different from what I've seen before, but with effort and practice, you can learn SO much.</comment>This course is very manageable. They provided a lot of practice problems/tests prior to the midterm/final which proved to be helpful. Steven is a great head TF and super helpful. The problem sets are not graded so if there are weeks where you don't have time to do them, it's okay. The midterms are fair even though they tend to be written a little longer than given the time to take them. Overall, I would recommend this course for those that have to take them.</comment>Be sure to do all the practice problems you can get your hands on. Don't worry so much about the textbook, only use it if there's a concept that you're still struggling with after asking a TF or Prof. Jacobson. Organic chemistry is essentially pattern recognition, once you get it and practice a lot, you'll be fine. Be sure to understand the concept, and then just practice as much as you can.</comment>Its a difficult class and it will punish you if you don't take it seriously. That said, I loved the challenge and if you treat every pset like a puzzle waiting to be solved, then you're going to enjoy it too.</comment>Jacobsen is a fantastic lecturer. Really pay attention in lecture. Do all of the practice problems you can get your hands on. Especially don't slack before the 1st midterm--you will want to have that solid grade as comfort later on. This course accelerates--just be ready to consistently put in a high level of effort</comment>There isn't much to say. If your dream is to become a doctor, you will either take Chem 17 or Chem 20 during your time at Harvard. Chem 17 is a great option because Dr. Jacobsen is an amazing teacher who can help you make sense of difficult topics. It's also nice that Chem 17 doesn't have a lab component. You can spend all of your time for the class understanding mechanisms and reactions without bumbling through lab.</comment>Be ready to work alot in this class if you want to get a good grade. Set aside time for the practice problems after section so you can get familiar with mechanisms and be ready to ask questions about theory since it is deceptively difficult</comment>If you're looking for a great instructor for Orgo, Prof. Jacobsen is the one for you. He makes sure we know exactly what he expects from us during his lectures. The PSets weren't graded this year. And the exams were fair (although sometimes sneaky!). But if you're really going to be a chemistry major, I think the 20/30 series would fit you better...this course seemed very broad and just taught me the basics of ochem. Nevertheless, I loved this class. Jacobsen and the teaching staff made organic chemistry as painless as possible. And I've even come to love it a little.</comment>Don't come into this class automatically expecting to hate it and for it to be a nightmare. It's hard enough without that. Focus more on understanding than memorization, particularly for material prior to the second midterm. Look through the psets for problems that simply confuse you when you look at them and go to office hours for those. Try not to waste too much time trying to do them on your own when you can work through them at OH and get help when you get stuck.</comment>This class was a much less painful vehicle for teaching organic chemistry than it could have been but it does not pair well with taking any other hard classes.</comment>It's very difficult - it's like learning a new language. It requires a lot of time, especially if you aren't naturally good at it like I was. With that said, if you work really hard and immerse yourself in it (as if it were a language) you can do well. The curve is very generous, especially if you're struggling (like I was). Its a good class though - definitely not as awful as I thought it would be.</comment>It's hard work, but worth it.  If you put in the hours, and I mean at least 2 extra hours per section + weekend time, you can get a high B/A in this class.  You need to attend office hours with the good TFs all the time, and really punch in the concepts you don't get in the beginning.  Know your retro aldols.  Review your midterms again before the final.  Enjoy the material, learn to love it so the semester goes by more quickly.  Take the class with friends.</comment>This course is very tough and deceivingly requires a lot of time and effort.</comment>This course is both interesting and necessary for all students who are interested in chemistry and fulfilling pre-med requirements. I think that the concepts taught in this class are very important for learning about chemistry in terms of a very applicable standpoint.</comment>If you want to do well you need to go to lecture and keep up with the material. This is not a class you can cram for last minute (a mistake I made).</comment>This course is a big challenge, but if you enter it with the right attitude and are willing to use all the resources available, it's not as daunting as people make it seem. It's not too demanding on a week-to-week basis, but come exam time, having put in the effort week-to-week makes your life much easier.</comment>Make sure you cover any gray areas in your understanding - problem-oriented or theoretical - as soon as they crop up, because the class will start to move ridiculously fast after the first midterm. Do well on the first midterm and third, because the second is on an enormous world of material that is the most difficult over the course. You must put a few hours into this class each day (or every other day) to make sure you stay on top of the material lecture-to-lecture in order to get in the A range.</comment>Put in a lot of work, do the practice problems, and then practice some more. This is a challenging course, and don't take it unless you REALLY need to. Some parts were definitely interesting, but I had to put in so much work for this ONE class. Also make sure that your workload is pretty light so that you can spend time on this class as you definitely will need to.</comment>Prof. Jacobsen and his lab are an amazing teaching staff. They are very dedicated and capable. When you feel like part of a team, as Jacobsen likes to say, "You are an organic chemist now" you feel motivated to put the hard work that this course requires. It IS a lot. but everything you learn is beautiful and there is no memorization in this course. Everything just makes sense if you do all the practice problems and psets and attend all the lectures. If you don't do that, you're screwed.</comment>It's very difficult so brace yourself. It's also very doable if you put the time in.</comment>Although a lot of students will state that this class is hard, it's actually very manageable. The problem sets are not time consuming at all, and even though the material can be challenging at times, you will not be pulling your hair out. Professor Jacobsen is an excellent lecturer.</comment>This class is super interesting and you will walk out being able to understand why certain molecules react with one another the way they do. It is really difficult but not impossible and just requires one to make the time to take advantage of all the resources that are offered (i.e. office hours, practice problems, weekly optional lecture, etc.)</comment>This course is very difficult and time consuming, but enjoyable if you like organic chemistry. It's definitely not for everyone.</comment>The class, while extremely difficult at some times, actually made me want to study chemistry. Professor Jacobsen and the TFs really cared how well we understood the material and tried to help when they could.</comment>Do lots of practice problems, and attend the optional lectures.</comment>Chem17 can be enjoyable if you stay on top of it and put the time in to really understand the material.</comment>If you are taking this class, it's probably because it's a requirement and you have to. Given that, you should try to make the best of it. Orgo is notorious for being a very difficult pre med class, and this is hard but it is also not impossible. There are a lot of resources such as office hours you can go to for help. Do all of the practice problems and read through annotated lectures. Midterms will be grueling, but they are curved so I guess that helps. The best way to master the material is by doing different mechanisms over and over and actually understanding why things are the way they are rather than relying on rote memorization.</comment>I would not willingly recommend this course to anyone based strictly on its subject matter. That being said, Professor Jacobsen is so phenomenal, approachable, and enthusiastic that I found myself enjoying every lecture. The course staff is there to help, and even if you struggle as much as I did, you come out of the class learning a lot.</comment>As a sophomore who was extremely afraid of organic chemistry and almost delayed it until junior year because of not feeling mentally prepared, I can tell you whole-heartedly do not delay. Chem 17 is the best class I have taken yet at Harvard. Professor Jacobsen is a master - a brilliant lecturer, clear and concise, and humorous enough (without trying to be do!) to keep students from drifting off. That being said, he will not be teaching this course in Fall 2015 so I cannot speak for whoever will step in for him. This class is extremely difficult, but there are more than enough resources in place for you to succeed. There are annotated lecture slides which are so useless to review, section handouts are perfect summaries, there are more practice problems than you'd ever need to understand every concept in the course. Problem sets were not graded, but of course were necessary to complete to learn material. Apparently, problem set performance will play into grade assignments when it comes into borderline grades, but I am not quite sure what this means beyond that. Head TF Steven Banik is perfect for this course, and the TF staff is incredible and so helpful during section and office hours. Please do yourself a favor and take Chem 17. I am a better student and harder worker because of it, and you will be too!</comment>Organic chemistry is daunting, but this course breaks it down to be not intimidating at all. Do the practice problems, and you'll be just fine. Reach out to the course staff; they are amazing, understanding, and helpful. Jacobsen is a really great lecturer, so be respectful during class. Make a study group and go to office hours. If you live in the Quad, there's an amazing science help table (but basically just for orgo) in Pfoho every Tuesday - GO!</comment>It's tough, but focus on what's interesting and let that intrinsic motivation guide you. And bring your enthusiasm to professor Jacobsen - he will return it with interest.</comment>Very hard, but put in effort and do practice problems and you will be alright.</comment>Like CS50, life-changing course. Take it because you have to but put the time into this class and you will get a lot out of it.</comment>As a non-premed who was taking this course for concentration requirement, I would say this course isn't as bad as people say it is. But be prepared to devotes hours learning the material early in the semester- there is a steep learning cure for the first month. After that, everything starts making sense.</comment>You need to have the time/willingness to devote to this if you want to learn. Everyone is really helpful, but it has to come from you.</comment>You should invest the time in learning mechanisms upfront. Do them over and over until you can do it from memory. Don't let the Prof/TF fool you: the exams are largely an assessment of how you can recognize and recapitulate these mechanisms in familiar and novel chemical reactions.</comment>This is a very well taught class. Jacobsen recognizes that most students are pre-meds who are required to take the class, so he makes this class as accessible and student-friendly as possible. This is not to say that the class is easy (it's definitely not), but every attempt is made by the professor and staff to support students and ensure they get the help they need. The material itself is interesting, and the course is taught in a linear manner, so the material at the end builds on the first lectures, which is logical and makes it easier to study. Overall, this a great class.</comment>If you're doing this class for fun like I was then it's absolutely great, if you're being forced to do it for pre-med, then it must suck. If you hate it this much, why are you doing pre-med?!?!</comment>Not bad when you put time into it</comment>The mentality in this class is so intense.  It's like 300 premeds in one room together, and they all show up every time and are so on top of their game.  Organic chemistry is difficult material.  This class alternately made me 
feel really motivated to learn everything and understand things and be the best, or feel like it was so difficult there was no way I could ever get it.  You future chem 17 ers can do this: the resources are there for you, you need to put in the effort and you can kill this class.</comment>be prepared</comment>You need to do all of the practice problems, and go to section.</comment>I took the class as an OEB elective because I thought it would be good for me as a well-rounded student and I loved it. I think coming in with an open mind helped me to appreciate it more. Jacobsen is a fantastic lecturer and the material is difficult but very interesting and rewarding and of course super applicable in both molecular biology and medicine/pharma. You probably have to take the course as a requirement. Make sure you have enough time on your schedule to fit it in. Some weeks, it really helps to spend an afternoon just on chemistry. I wasn't sure I wanted to take the course, so I found old lecture videos over the summer and worked myself about 1/3 of the way in; that was really helpful, too.</comment>This was an excellent and well-organized organic chemistry class.  Dr. Jacobsen is an extremely lucid and straightforward teacher, and his lectures were always engaging.  However, the material requires a lot of additional practice - be sure to study as you go, and to ask any questions as they arise, or you could quickly fall behind.</comment>Take this only if you have to. If you don't have intuition for the material, you will struggle through and may still not get it regardless of how much work you put in, which makes it...orgo. Weekly problem sets + 3 midterms + final.</comment>If you are interested in this material or needed to take this class as a requirement, this is a pretty good course to take. Just make sure to actually invest time outside of class and outside of psets (like doing discussion questions every week) to keep up, because just doing the basic assignments will not get you through the course on good footing.</comment>It is hard but rewarding when you get it right and finally understand something and is extremely logical. kind of like solving puzzles.</comment>Go in with an open mind and a positive attitude. The material is surprisingly interesting, and you will be able to conquer it if you put in the time (albeit a lot of time). Even though problem sets may not be graded, do your best on them because they will be key concepts tested on the midterms, and feedback from your TF on psets often warn you about seemingly subtle mistakes (that they would take off many points for). Doing as many of the practice problems as you can is essential, and the Friday reviews were really helpful as well, as well as the Head TF exam reviews. Essentially, this class will eat up a ton of your life, but it is much less of a monster than people make it out to be. You can do it! :) [The molecular model kit is not really essential (rent it at Cabot Science Lib for free rather than buying it), but the textbook is helpful.]</comment>Chem 17 was certainly difficult and a lot of work, but it was taught so well that it is hard to fault it too much. Professor Jacobsen was a great lecturer and seemed to genuinely care whether the class understood what he was teaching and the support structure of the class was some of the best I have seen during a class at Harvard.</comment>be very prepared for the class and review material even before taking class</comment>It requires a lot of time and thorough attention right from the beginning. The book is less helpful than the lecture slides and problems provided in class, but it can be helpful as an additional reference. Also, it helps to go to lots of different office hours (and sometimes even sections) to find which TF's are able to explain things in a way you understand.</comment>Honestly one of the best classes I've taken at the college. I don't consider myself to be too bright and I found that if I put in the work and adopted Jacobsen's methods of looking at problems that I could figure out even the hardest questions. It's a really rewarding class. Just make sure to be focused and don't freak out in tests. Make sure to study everyday!</comment>I dreaded orgo as the worst premed requirement, and actually loved Chem 17. Take advantage of office hours and do practice problems! Chem 17 definitely requires a lot of time. Also, Professor Jacobson does a great job of reminding you how this material (and the biochemistry in Chem 27) is actually related to medicine. Be open to orgo! By the end of the class, I really found it fascinating how the functional groups we learned about form into some really complicated molecules -- through mechanisms that you actually learn about in Chem 17! Approach this class with an open mind, and you might enjoy it!</comment>The first half of Chem 17 is very well taught. Pay attention to MO theory in the beginning because it will make the rest of the course so much easier.</comment>I really enjoyed Chem 17. I was super impressed with the teaching staff, and I definitely feel like I learned a lot. Although orgo has the reputation of being really difficult, I think it was taught effectively and there were enough practice problems, psets, etc. to adequately prepare for each midterm and the final. I also found the course material to be interesting (which I know probably is just a matter of personal preference) but I think if you like chemistry this would be a great class to take.</comment>If you have to take orgo or are interested in it at all this was SUCH a well done course. Be prepared for a lot of work, though. Practice problems were the way to go for me--I stopped going to review sessions and just did all the practice problems from section over again in preparation for the tests and I did great after those.</comment>This class was amazing. I enjoyed it so much that I decided to become a Chemistry concentrator. Many students find the class difficult and do not enjoy it because the class is just a premed requirement in their mind. The class is more than this though. It is an amazing opportunity to learn about organic Chemistry with one of the best professors Harvard has to offer. Professor Jacobsen is amazing. The class is truly fascinating and I truly enjoyed it.</comment>Definitely do-able. While the curve is not the most generous due to the nature of the pre-meds in the class, I'm really impressed with how well the course is taught and structured. If you want the help and put in the effort, it's there. If you take the time to learn, you'll get a lot out of it and gain a much deeper understanding of organic chemistry--it can actually be really beautiful and intuitive, and I'm pretty happy with how well it was taught and did not find it to be the dreadful orgo class at all.</comment>very hard but Jacobson is a super good lecturer, made me understand PS1 too.</comment>You have to be really prepared.</comment>THIS CLASS IS THE WORST. I AM A CHEM CONCENTRATOR AND I HATED IT. TAKE 20/30, BECAUSE IT ISN'T WORTH THE HEARTACHE. THIS CLASS WAS 13 WEEKS OF MISERY. 

But honestly though, the exams were unnecessarily difficult, and filled with "gotcha" questions. Furthermore, you're graded against how the others in the class do. I think that if I would have waited until my junior year to do this, I would have done much better.</comment>This was my favorite class of the semester. The material was challenging, but the hard work really paid off. Jacobsen is a wonderful person and professor and if you really get the time to know and appreciate what he does, you'll find each and every lecture valuable. The TF staff was amazing as well, emails were responded to very promptly and office hours were frequent.</comment>This course is well taught and well designed. Be prepared to continually put in a lot of work. You will learn an amazing amount throughout the semester. Do not get discouraged if things are hard at first!</comment>It is a difficult class - be prepared to work very hard in this class. If you do well, though, it can be an incredibly rewarding experience. It requires a lot of work outside of class, but Professor Jacobsen is a great lecturer.</comment>Chem 17 definitely takes a lot of time. There's enough practice material, but b prepared to spend a lot of time practicing for the midterms and exams. Definitely take advantage of the practice material! It was a really interesting class, and Prof. Jacobsen, Steven, and the TF's are all really helpful!</comment>Stay on top of your work, attend all lectures and sections, do all the practice problems</comment>Chem 17 is not an easy course. It requires a lot of work and a lot of time. If you are pre-med you have to take it. Take time after each lecture to review material and go to office hours if you need help.</comment>If you procrastinate in this course you will regret it for the rest of your life.</comment>Jacobsen is an excellent lecturer, and the sections were extremely helpful (as someone who basically never goes to section for any class, let me tell you -- they're worth it).  Looking back on the semester, it's truly astounding how much I've learned.  I feel like I speak an entirely different language.  Overall a thoroughly enjoyable, well taught class which imparts solid chemistry fundamentals.  It's a pretty heavy workload yes, but if you are someone who is good at pattern recognition/learning new concepts quickly, the exams will be easy. If you are remotely interested in the material, take it.</comment>It is a good course for a premed, good curve. Really wish there was a big picture lecture to connect all we learned together.</comment>This was the best class ever!</comment>definitely go to office hours! the tfs are super helpful! practice problems help for exams!</comment>The course is very hard. But take advantage of the wonderful teaching staff. The TFs are so knowledgeable and willing to help.  The lectures are good, though they sometimes don't match the problem sets will, but the sections do. And PRACTICE all the time.</comment>be on top of everything from the very beginning. the early stuff is the easiest, and it's critical that you understand this stuff to succeed througout the semester</comment>Class is hard and difficult but once you understand concepts, you literally get the best feeling ever - about Chem of course.</comment>Takes a lot of time</comment>Go to class</comment>It's organic chemistry. It is really hard and it is not fun. You will be about as miserable as you would expect. Stay far away from this class unless it is required of you. Hopefully chem 17 will be a better friend to you than it was to me.</comment>Spend time doing all of the practice problems in the section packet each week, get a tutor if you need to and don't feel bad about it, practice completing exams within the allotted time period (that may be the most difficult part of the course).</comment>Practice doesn't make perfect...but at least improvement.</comment>Odds are you have to take is course anyway. The bat thing you can do for yourself is doing practice problems throughout the duration of the course. Do not focus just on mechanisms, but perform the mechanism in the context of complicated practice problems. This is the best way to learn the mechanisms. Use the materials that are available to you, spend lots of time studying, GO TO OFFICE HOURS, and you can totally do well in his class.</comment>This is a really well-designed course, but be prepared to work work work. Especially if you don't get it right away, like I did. There's definitely a learning curve, and believe me the faster you can learn the basics, the better off you'll be. Be prepared to work really hard the first few weeks; it'll help you so much later on. The practice problems are sooo helpful. Do ALL of them. I also found it super helpful to read and learn the annotated slides before lecture. That way, the lecture was a recap of the concept instead of presenting this huge, abstract concept that I wouldn't understand.</comment>At least for me, Chem 17 was a very, very difficult course--not in terms of workload but just in terms of learning how to think about the material. Mechanisms, for example, didn't click for me until the literal night before the final exam--and instructors aren't always super great about helping you figure out general ways of thinking about orgo. It's a premed course and I definitely feel that there's a very strong premed mentality with regard to mastering the material--I was told many times just to drill practice problems when all I really needed was someone to walk me through the logic of how to figure out a certain problem. If you're not someone who likes learning by repeating practice problems over and over again, I'd venture to say that you might want to take a look at Chem 20.</comment>This class is designed in such a way that makes it really easy to fall behind without you even noticing. PSETs are not mandatory, nor do they have any impact on your grade despite the amount of time you spend on them, and most of the time they are many, many times easier than the exams. The material that is given to prepare for the exams is NEVER on the same difficulty level as said exams, and it makes it really misleading and disappointing when students think that they have done everything possible to prepare for an exam and are feeling well about the material, only to take the exam and find that none of the material resembled anything done in preparation. Overall, it's a really unfair class and the amount of effort that is necessary to do well in the class is much more than you could imagine. Definitely do not take with other important classes.</comment>Please take this comment seriously. I took this course hearing nothing but how difficult it would be, and it was. But it is a course that, when approached with correct and efficient studying, will leave you knowing A LOT of important organic chemistry, and a not too stressful experience culminating in a grade you're happy with.

In my opinion, you just need to do a few things. Familiarize yourself with important concepts the summer before (buy a book or something). Attend every lecture and skim the annotated slides before lecture to have an idea about the material covered. Take notes on the lecture material. Do every pset alone, then check. Do all practice problems. Go to every section. Get rest and take care of your body.

It's kind of alot but if you do these things, the course won't be as difficult as people say. The only difficulty will be complex concepts that require extra explaining. 

Thanks for reading...

p.s. professor Jacobsen is a great lecturer.</comment>If you're premed or even just concentrating in one of the life sciences, you probably need organic chemistry, and this is probably one of the least painful ways of doing it. The class is extremely well-organized and if you put in the work it's rewarding. Professor Jacobson is an excellent lecturer who tries to make the material clear without ever coming off as patronizing and the TFs are pretty good too</comment>You should take Chemistry 17 if you are interested in organic chemistry. I did not shop Chem 20 but I felt that Chem 17 was doable if you need to take organic chemistry for a pre-med or concentration requirement. I recommend that you try to find what you enjoy about it, whether it's drawing molecules (which can be fun if you like to draw) or problem solving which is relatively straightforward! Don't be worried if exams are difficult, there is usually a generous curve.</comment>You will definitely learn a lot of organic chemistry if you take this course and gain skills that can be applied to biology. The teaching staff are very approachable, knowledgeable, and helpful. However, make sure you plan your schedule to reflect the great deal of time you will spend on this course weekly. There aren't really any shortcuts to learning the material - a lot of practice is required.</comment>Take an orgo course online/at a state school before/instead of this course</comment>This class is very difficult but also rewarding. I know most people are taking this class for a Pre-Med requirement, but if you put in the effort to this course you will find yourself becoming a much better scientist and overall thinker.</comment>It's an EXTREMELY study-intensive course, but the knowledge seems to build on itself in an upward-spiral kind of way, so you're constantly reviewing earlier material along the way, which helps.</comment>It's a good intro to orgo.</comment>If you want to do extremely well, you should spend all of your free time studying organic chemistry, and plan your courses accordingly. If you have a good attitude, and study well, you should be fine.</comment>This is unexpectedly one of the most satisfying classes I have taken at Harvard. For people interested in how living systems work on the level of atoms and molecules, this is a great course. The workload and difficulty are very high but is definitely worth it. Make sure to stay on top of the course material every week, go to section, and take the problem sets seriously even though they are not graded. They help a lot for exams. Jacobsen is also a very engaging and humorous lecture, and by the end, you will be in a position to really admire what he has contributed to the field. Overall, not a walk in the park but a great course nonetheless.</comment>Organic chemistry is not as scary as people say it is. Professor Jacobsen is a great lecturer who makes the material easy to understand, and even fun. Exams are hard, but curves are generous. Approach this class with the right attitude and it will be a rewarding experience.</comment>This is a premed requirement, but it is taught well. The material is interesting if you like problem solving. There is not a huge amount of work for the course, but if you want to do well you need to allot a tremendous amount of time to studying for exams/working on problem sets to make sure you really get the most out of all the resources provided. Do as many practice problems as you can.</comment>People's opinions on orgo depended entirely on their attitudes going in. If you see it as an annoying requirement, you may overlook the beauty of it. This was the most organized class I have ever taken. Jacobsen is not a flashy lecturer; he's just excellent at teaching without the unnecessary flair. I was impressed by all of the materials and tools we were given to succeed. Amazing course.</comment>In this class, you gotta GRIND.  Whoever grinds hardest, shines hardest.  Gotta really study, and work hard on psets.  Also do all the practice problems.  Get a tutor.  It is possible to improve on this course.  I went from an E average to an A minus average.  Don't read the book.</comment>This class is definitely worth taking if you are interested in chemistry then I would take this. It is extremely well taught and the psets are graded so it takes a lot of stress off. Ther are no labs either so do not get intimidated from the idea of taking orgo. This is a premed class and I was not premed, so if you take it as a choice beware that you will be around all the premed classes and there is some competitive nature in all sections and office hours!</comment>Chem 17 was a wonderful experience. The class takes you from the basic ideas of chemistry to complex mechanisms in a way that gives you all the tools necessary to succeed. Prof. Jacobsen is an incredible person and lecturer–learning from him was one of the highlights of my college career.

Make sure to set aside the time each week to really learn what is in the lecture slides. Weeks can be on disparate topics, so one week could be easy and the next very difficult to understand depending on your experience and mindset. If you keep up and put in the work, the class is absolutely manageable and even enjoyable.

This was a Senior fall elective for me and it was the highlight of my semester. I encourage you to come into the class with a positive mindset and you will get an incredible amount from this class. Chem 17 takes a nearly impossible task of teaching organic chemistry in one semester and makes it an excellent experience.</comment>Not very accessible to students who are generally interested in learning some basic organic chemistry. Premed-ness is heavily emphasized by professor, who constantly mentions the mcat.</comment>only take this if your pre-med</comment>Get ready for one hell of a ride, this class is difficult because it requires a lot of time to review moderately difficult concepts that are taught in high volume and fast speed. Make sure you have plenty of time to devote to this course, and that you clear your weekends before the exams. The practice problems are key, but often I didn't get a chance to get to them until right before the exam--big mistake.</comment>Your performance in this class will depend a lot of how much time you put in. If you don't understand something, go to office hours; don't wait.</comment>If you work hard, seek out help/collaborate, and try to enjoy it, you'll enjoy it. If not, you'll hate it. There's not much more to it than that.</comment>Though if you're pre-med, there's no way out of orgo, chem 17 is not a bad way to do it.</comment>It's simply a fun and great challenge.</comment>This is a really interesting course and although challenging is manageable especially with the help of office hours. The most important thing for this course is to not fall behind because it can be difficult to catch up. Jacobsen is a really great lecturer!!</comment>Fantastic course.</comment>You will get out what you put in- don't give up.</comment>do lots of practice problems</comment>It's organic chemistry, it's obviously going to be difficult. Just stay on top of the material, go to section, and do ALL the problem set problems and extra practice problems because the only way to truly learn the material is to do the problems over, and over, and over...</comment>You'll appreciate the organization of this course. Lectures, sections, and exams are all well executed and no-nonsense. It's challenging material but the teaching staff does a great job of making sure that it isn't frustrating. Do the practice problems. Don't get disheartened if you don't understand something at first, even under exam pressure. Organic chemistry's no joke, but you'll master it if you persevere.</comment>It's a puzzle-solving class! You learn a bunch of mechanisms (puzzle pieces) and then pull it all together into more complex problems. Interesting, challenging, you learn a TON! Jacobsen is a wonderful lecturer, and his annotated slides are incredibly thorough. No need to take notes in lecture. Just listen and then read the slides later. Keep up with the material, do all the practice problems, and you'll stay afloat.</comment>This is a tough course that you need to be ready to dedicate a lot of time in to do well. However, you will learn a lot and it is worth it. Go to the 'optional' stuff; it makes a huge difference.</comment>Chem17 is a very very hard class, and requires a lot of time and effort, but it is an amazing class. It is probably my favorite class I've taken at Harvard thus far.</comment>This class is certainly difficult, and it requires a lot of hard work and dedication. However, the essentially effort-based, relatively-insignificant-for-grades problem sets really help lower the stress level. If you make sure to stay on top of the mechanisms, you'll do great.</comment>Chem17 was a really great intro to organic chemistry and I thoroughly enjoyed it! It was appropriately challenging (but not painfully so), and I really learned a lot. Organic chemistry is awesome, and if you develop an appreciation for the subject, you'll love the class! The teaching staff is super helpful and Jacobsen is amazing! I highly recommend getting to know him after class. Also, office hours with the TFs are super helpful so go to those as well! For the exams, the best way to prepare is by doing many practice problems. Problem sets aren't really graded, so your entire grade is based off the exams -- so do lots of practice!</comment>Don't take this unless you have to.</comment>Even though organic chemistry is incredibly difficult and time-consuming, Professor Jacobsen is a great professors and really focuses on teaching you the fundamental concepts underlying the mechanisms and problems as opposed to focusing on just rote memorization, the part of organic chemistry that people generally complain about. Even though it requires a lot of focus and time, it is an incredibly rewarding class and is definitely worth it!</comment>Lectures are clear, but it requires so much work. Teaching team is great. Go to office hours. Always.</comment>Keep a running list of all the mechanisms covered in class as they come. Professor Jacobsen will tell you this at the beginning of the semester and you should definitely do it! Make sure to keep up with the material as it comes, and I suggest going through the lecture notes before going to lecture. It will really enhance your lecture experience. Finally, practice practice practice, and not just the weekend before the exam. Chem 17 is an effort based course, but you can't expect to put in a bunch of hours a few days before the exam and do well. You need to put in the hours as the material comes, and if you do this, you will succeed.</comment>The class is super well-taught and really well-organized! Great way to satisfy a concentration/premed requirement. Note that basically all the students in the class are premed though, so if you're looking to take an organic chemistry class for the sake of chemistry, the 20-30 series might be more for you. (The 20-30 series is synthetic, the 17-27 series is more mechanisitic). That said, you can learn a lot from this course! (I took organic chemistry in high school, and I still got a lot out of this course in terms of really understanding the concepts behind the mechanisms.)</comment>Be ready to put a lot of time and energy into the course</comment>This class is extremely well-organized and Professor Jacobsen is a very clear lecturer.  No busy work.  Be prepared to work very hard for tests and spend a lot of time studying, but worth it because the material is so interesting and useful.</comment>I don't really know how this course is different from chem 20 but it got the job done.  It wasn't as painful as I expected and Jacobsen is a wonderful professor.  Still the hardest class I've ever taken.  Yes I fell asleep in lecture 1/3 of the time but I don't really know how that could have been avoided.  Also I never went to office hours but that probably would have been helpful.</comment>It is what you expect- Orgo is not easy- though Professor Jacobsen is incredible- thae class is a lot of work and requires that one complete all practice questions- sometimes 5 times over- but you will truly get  lot out of it.</comment>Orgo is not as difficult as everyone says it is.  It requires you to practice, and it requires you to know a few concepts very, very well.  A lot of doing well on the midterms is identifying what concept they want you to reference, and just knowing your mechanisms.  I found practicing the generalized mechanisms as they were written in the section handouts very very helpful.  Just be able to do that from memory, do some applications, and know the concepts, and you should do very well.  Also, you should know acidity/basicity inside out and backwards.

The cool stuff really culminates at the end, and I completely agree with the way Jacobsen mapped out the course. It's actually insane how much you actually learn and recognize and can do by the end of the course, and they really make it as painless as possible.</comment>The section handouts were extremely helpful, but the biggest single complaint I had about the class was that the p-sets are not graded or explicitly incorporated into your final grade at all. If you are not a good test taker, your grade will suffer. Professor Jacobsen was a so-so lecturer but it's clear that he fully expects you to pick up the material and terminology quickly. You're probably taking this course because you have to, and if you devote time to consistently keeping up with the material (and getting over the initial, steep learning curve), you'll probably do at least decently in this class.</comment>This is class is definitely a challenge because it's organic chemistry, but it is the best taught class at Harvard in my opinion. It's very well organized and extremely well taught, I highly recommend it!</comment>work hard right from the start to get a strong understanding of the basics</comment>ls1a and ls1b prepare you just fine for chem 17. you do NOT need ps1 or ps11 to do well in this class if you've taken ap chemistry. that being said, this course was my hardest of sophpomore fall. balance your classes, make sure you have one really easy one to go along with chem 17. GO TO THE FRIDAY LECTURES. they're optional but they're pretty much necessary for success. so is section! do the practice problems and practice tests, and do them more than once. make review sheets, and go to office hours and help sessions. however, the material itself, while hard to grasp the first time around, becomes very straightforward and second-nature by the end of the course! be aware that there are three midterms, one of which happens a couple days after thanksgiving break, and one of which happens on the very last day of class before reading period.</comment>It's a lot of work, but the course is structured well, and there are multiple resources to use for help provided.  Overall I found the course very rewarding.  As long as you put in the time to understand the material, I think the course is very interesting and improves problem solving skills as well as overall chemistry knowledge.  The teaching staff are very willing to help in whatever way they can, and Professor Jacobsen is very open to questions and willing to further explain aspects of the material that students find confusing (especially during the Friday sessions).  I went in dreading orgo, but in the end, although it was definitely a lot of time/work, found it very rewarding!</comment>You will be forced to work very hard but you will learn a lot.</comment>This class is super cool. I don't care if you're not required to take it; you should anyway. It'll change your life. For the better, I think. It's great, but does take some time if you want to do well.</comment>Professor Jacobson is an AMAZING teacher.  He is a great lecturer, and the section leaders will help you understand the hardest concepts.  The Professor puts in incredibly time and effort to ensure that there are ample notes/other resources available to reference, and if you are interested in orgo for more than the pre-med aspect, Jacobson's work is fascinating, and he makes a great effort to share some extended applications of organic chemistry.</comment>It's OChem. It sucks, it's hard, but you have to do it. Office hours will be a mess, so if you need help on the psets, email your TF with your questions rather than trying to fight your way through the masses of people demanding help. Do as many practice problems as you can, and accept the fact that you will probably do horribly on the second midterm-- it's okay, everyone does.</comment>I'm a social sciences concentrator but I loved this class. Jacobsen is a great lecturer and super passionate about the subject. Naturally, his enthusiasm was evident in his teaching and his willingness to assist students to the utmost of his ability. The class is very well-structured and provides great class notes/materials to allow you to do well. You have to put in the effort (obviously) but anyone who puts their mind to it can do it! It's a manageable class,but only you know your limits/your aptitude for science. I don't think I could have taken this class with others classes with heavy workloads so I tried to balance my schedule appropriately. Don't be afraid to ask the TFs/Professor Jacobsen for help, they are all extremely helpful and nice and genuinely want you to be able to understand the material.</comment>Definitely a difficult class, so keep up with the lectures. The annotated slides are extremely helpful. And practice lots of problems!</comment>it's a good class, but you NEED to put in the time every week or you will fall behind without realizing it.  pay attention in lecture and review the day's material THAT NIGHT or it will be too much come time to study for the midterm. they grade harshly on exams so be careful with your diagrams, syntax, wording, etc.</comment>I was on the fence between taking Chem20 in the spring and taking this course. I could not have been happier with my decision. Jacobsen, although he will be on sabbatical '15-'16, the structure of the course is very organized, fair, straightforward, and stress-free. P-sets are graded based on completion and effort. They actually provide notes with the important material all nicely organized. I don't think there is another class here that does that. Take this class. If you are hesitating, because you don't have a strong chemistry background, I would still go for it. I came in with relatively little chem background (no AP chem in high school), but orgo chem is another world. As long as you do the practice problems, you'll be fine. I really enjoyed this class. It was probably my favorite class here at Harvard. The staff is so supportive. The lectures are interesting. If you go to all lectures and review lectures and sections, it will be 6 hours of class a week. And two last words: NO LAB</comment>Orgo for me was such a struggle, but at the same time it was one of the best classes I took this semester.  It was amazing to see how much I had learned when I was studying for exams because problems that at one point had seemed impossible became relatively easy.</comment>Chem 17 is a well structured course with a variety of good resources and practice problems, and not as scary as many make out Orgo to be. It does require a lot of practice to get good -- as does anything. I didn't manage my time correctly, didn't practice, and it showed in my low grades. Be responsible. Set aside time to do as many practice problems as you can. Read the text + annotated slides *before* class. Some might think this is all common sense, but hey -- I'm a senior and I didn't know this. I was able to get by other classes without doing reading and practice, but it is necessary in Chem 17.  It's like solving a bunch of logic problems/puzzles. 

A great class that grades very fairly. Professor Jacobsen and the TF's want to see your success, and they are very encouraging. Chem 17 gets you prepped to think the "why" and "how" behind organic chemistry. Conceptual, but concrete in that there are many applications. Really wish I had dedicated more time to this-- it's possible to do well. As I near the end of my college career, I realize that a lot of doing well has to do more with managing your time well rather than your capability.</comment>I loved the material. If you stay on top of the work, it's not so daunting, and they provide you with plenty of study material.</comment>This course is tough. Harvard gives you all the resources to help you get through it, but you need to take advantage of them. Go to office hours. Email your TF with questions. Put in the extra effort, and you'll benefit from Chem 17.</comment>It has high curve.</comment>The section handouts and doing the practice problem handouts are key. Go to Steven's review sessions. They are extremely helpful.</comment>Make sure you take advantage of all of the practice problems.</comment>The class is really well organized.  In terms of a class, it does just about everything right. The con is that it is not presented the most interesting.  It is fun to figure out mechanisms you spend hours working on, but there is nothing that really exhilarating about the course! (i.e. the class is kinda boring) You learn a lot though!</comment>There is no way around orgo being tough, but Chem 17 is well taught and Jacobsen is very accessible.  If you want to make your life easier, go to the Friday discussion sessions and just do your homework there.</comment>Chem 17 is very well structured, and a very interesting class. Professor Jacobsen is an amazing lecturer, and not only explains difficult topics well, but keeps lectures interesting and engaging. The staff of chem 17 is all very considerate, and tuned in to the needs of the students. Also, the assignments are very useful and fun to do- after completing the problem sets, I always felt like I thoroughly understood the concepts.</comment>If Professor Jacobsen's teaching the course, then be prepared for very boring lectures and make sure you read the post-lecture slides and do lots of practice problems.</comment>Everybody always yells and shouts about how awful orgo is and how impossible it is. THIS IS SO NOT TRUE. This course provides you with so much material to use when studying and there really aren't many surprises on the tests. Obviously the material is difficult but if you keep up with it lecture after lecture and review all material given to you, and most importantly DO ALL THE PRACTICE problems you should get an A-, at least!!</comment>You can make this class however enjoyable you want. It requires a LOT of time and practice to actually succeed, so if you want to do well, you definitely have to make it a priority (at times, the amount of effort you have to put in feels a little unrealistic sometimes on top of three other classes, extracurriculars, etc.). The teaching staff are really good and there is a myriad of resources at your disposal, you just have to take advantage of them.</comment>This class is a truly fantastic way to learn organic chemistry. No, it's not easy, but the teaching staff is INCREDIBLE and they do everything to make material as simple and straightforward as possible, without skimping on depth of knowledge. The workload isn't bad at all, it consists only of 1 weekly pset and exam preparation (you are given oodles of optional practice problems). For the most part, exams are fair, and they are curved really generously. This class is so well organized, Jacobsen does such an amazing job lecturing, and TFs are so dedicated and helpful. This is not a class to dread - if you care about this class, you will be rewarded!</comment>To do all kinds of problems that they can find on the websites and also to learn to see the connections in how molecules are made, i.e from starting material to product</comment>Really try to understand the concepts and not just the mechanisms.</comment>I was shocked to realize I enjoyed the course! I had moments where I doubted my abilities but practice was really all it took to understand it.</comment>This is a challenging class. You can do it, however, if you put the effort in. Do all the practice problems. Do them again. Ask questions. Go the review sessions. The challenge is in becoming so familiar with mechanisms and concepts that you don't have to spend much time thinking when something weird is in front of you. You see the signs right away. Therefore, do the problems. Also, try to make it that you have the opportunity to drop part of the final rather than one of the midterms. The final is much more challenging than the midterms so it's nice to have that cushion.</comment></course>CHEM 106: Advanced Organic Chemistry</title>Engage in conversation with the instructor to be sure of the topical material for the duration of the semester. Do not take this course without a strong background in organic chemistry and a strong desire to dive deep into given topics with the assumption that you know quite a bit about them. Expect other things to come up too, ranging from physical chemistry and computations to spectroscopy, specifically NMR.</comment>For undergrads mostly: You should have a genuine interest in Chemistry and not be too fazed by not understanding things. There were a lot of things I think I still haven't really grasped, but I appreciate having been introduced to all those concepts.</comment>If you approach this class the right way it will be very rewarding and you will learn a lot. The two most important things are that you must motivate yourself to be interested in the subject matter and you must be very willing to ask Eugene for clarification on things you don't understand both in lecture and office hours. You will get out as much as you put into this course, but you need to take some responsibility for your own learning.</comment></course>EXPOS 20.277: American Criminals</title>Although the actually texts were interesting, the classes were boring and the instructor was not very helpful.</comment>You won't be analyzing criminals or solving crime, but the topic allows for lots of research and sources, and Lindsay is really helpful.</comment>Very interesting and engaging class. For a required class, I'd definitely recommend it for the psychology-based and very applicable conversations we had in class.</comment>This is a solid and fun expos. The assignments are occasionally a little unclear, but Lindsay is a good teacher and the final paper is very fun to write.</comment>The reading material in this course is extremely interesting. The assignments are pretty straightforward.</comment>The class was for the most part helpful in gaining important writing skills, but many handouts and assignments were not helpful if you already have a good idea of what thesis-writing is about. The preceptor tried to make the class slightly easier and more entertaining for freshman, but in doing so sometimes compromised rigor. This actually made the class less interesting.</comment>The materials used are really wonderful. Be prepared to really analyze and edit your own writing. Crafting essays that are effective and interesting takes a lot of attention, revision, criticism, and work, but the reward is huge. My biggest triumph was learning how to create truly arguable and conflict-oriented theses.</comment>The subject of criminals is very interesting, especially if an individual has been fascinated with the subject beforehand.</comment></course>SOC-WORLD 50: Political Corruption</title>Corruption tackled the theory, practice, and issues surrounding political corruption. Very narrow lens of the course, as a result content may seem repetitive.</comment>You will learn a lot about how to think about political corruption and all of its intricacies. The class does not require a significant amount of work, but you should try to keep up with the readings as much as possible. The lectures and the readings complement each other, and you don't want to have to read a significant number of papers during reading period.</comment>Please take it!! The material, the lectures, the section, the fun assignments, everything was so compelling and relevant! I learnt SO MUCH out of this course! And it was straight forward to do the assignments..</comment>There is a lot of reading involved</comment>This is a relatively painless Gen Ed to knock out the Societies of the World requirement. The course has a relatively low amount of work, though much of your grade is backloaded in assignments due in the final two weeks. Lectures are pretty average, not spectacular but not terrible by any means. Not that rewarding of a class (the subject felt far too broad and simple) but not too painful, either.</comment>The professors are both passionate about the topic of this course: corruption. Sarika is also a great TF who wants to make sure students understand everything. Lecture can sometimes be a bit dry, but overall the readings and assignments are all interesting, and section is quite helpful in going through all of the readings - but you should definitely do the readings before section!</comment>The material and what you'll learn is really interesting, but the class is very poorly run. Lectures tend to drone on without much useful going on. TF also makes mandatory section, mandatory talking twice during it, and has surprise assignments sent out in the middle of long emails that you might not see, and never mentions it. Project is fun, but a lot of the instructions and expectations are very vague and unclear</comment>Don't expect the readings to be directly tied in to the lecture - the readings for each week were more of a prep for the main topic that was going to be discussed. So with that in mind, glance over all of them and jot down main points and new ideas, but don't pour over them for hours. They are supplemental.</comment>For either government concentrators or just a general education class this class offers interesting material that will engage you throughout the semester from a variety of different viewpoints. Economists and sociologists shouldn't shy away from this class either as all viewpoints on corruption are taken into account and analyzed.</comment>A painless way to fulfull gen ed and comparative gov requirements. Does exactly what gov 20 does but without the readings. With Levitsky gone this year, take this class.</comment>This course is really interesting and teaches you a lot, and gives you a new way to think about the world. Professor Ziblatt is great, but Professor Alt can be boring at times. Sarika is an amazing TF--very helpful and understanding.</comment>This course is great! The professors are thoughtful and engaging, willing to meet outside of class, and respond to questions. Be ready for the papers and projects. None of them are very big or difficult, but there is a surprising number of them.</comment>This is a really interesting course that makes you think about some very important issues. Some lectures are much better than others and the readings are really huge-don't fall behind on the readings. Also make sure to read the directions for all the assignments as you will be graded very strictly on following a rubric.</comment>This class is relatively easy and the material is pretty straightforward. Some of the readings are a little boring, but overall the topics are interesting and the professors make lectures interesting and engaging.</comment>This class is more than just political corruption! You learn many psychological, cultural, institutional, and economic theories as well that apply across many disciplines. This course is not only fascinating and a great way to fulfill your gen ed requirements, but will change the way you think as well.</comment>This is a class from which you will learn a fair deal without too much effort. The subject matter is interesting and assignments can be quite fun. You only need to understand the core proposition of each reading, not be familiar with them in detail.</comment>The content is interesting, and it is not too challenging. There are a lot of assignments though and the exams require a lot of preparation.</comment>The class was very interesting! The assignments are very much doable and group presentation was even fun. There are quite a few readings and it can be easy to fall behind so try to do them every night.</comment>hopefully the lecturers will change and maybe improve the organization of the course, but overall it's a super interesting topic and kind of a gem in terms of workload/grade ratio</comment>This is a great way to fill a gen ed. The professors are great lecturers and the material is incredibly interesting. I usually avoid classes with group projects, but the one for this class was actually really useful and didn't require a lot of meetings outside of class.</comment>The lectures can be boring, but the material is interesting. It's a pretty easy, and a good way to satisfied the SW Gen Ed requirement.</comment>This course offered a good look at corruption and the ambiguities in defining that. The quality of the lectures definitely differs between professors. Professor Ziblatt is clear, on time, and easy to understand, but Professor Alt's lectures were uneven, with some material given far more time than other equally important subjects and many tangents intermixed. The material itself isn't too challenging, and while the readings can be dry at times, the section discussions make up for it.</comment></course>PSY 2358r: Memory: Research Seminar</title>I personally really liked the experience because I've been super interested in memory/episodic simulation research. But it is one of those courses where you'll get what you put into it, and while not matter what, you'll probably get a good sense of the research process, you should be pretty interested in the topic of research if you really want to enjoy it.</comment>This lab is such a great environment, with so much hands on analysis.</comment>This lab is a great way to get involved in research and to see what kind of academic work is being done in your field of interest.</comment></course>GOV 2148: Civil Society, West and East</title>If you hope to learn civil society, I would definitely recommend this course. The course can fulfill your expectations of all levels as the Professors are truly good. You do need to spend enough time if you hope to get the most out of the course, especially if you are a non-native speaker. You can learn a lot as long as you work hard on your readings, in lectures and discussions, and go to office hours.</comment>Not a course to be missed!</comment></course>EXPOS 10.014: Introduction to Expository Writing</title>Expos 10 is a highly beneficial experience. If you are placed into the class do not take it as a negative, it is a joy and is very helpful in preparing you for Expos 20.</comment>It is up to you to improve your writing to the magnitude you would like</comment>I think it is worth taking because it is a light writing course that teaches you a lot!</comment>It will help you transition from high school to college writing.</comment>You will definitely see your improvement with every writing. It is such a helpful course.</comment>Encouraged to voice my own opinion through my writing unlike following a formula like in highschool. You're encouraged to develop your own writing style which brings a new hope to writing essays.</comment></course>SCAND 90r.a: Danish</title>This class is fantastic! But obviously I wouldn't recommend it to someone not interested in learning Danish.</comment>Rune is awesome. Take Danish! It's super fun and a tiny class.</comment>Danish has been and still is one of the most enjoyable classes I have taken at Harvard. It is very unlike most college courses in that it is essentially stress-free and I always look forward to class. It is a very low workload, and most of the homework is fun anyway (for example, we watch a Danish TV-series). This makes Danish a choice if you are looking to fulfill the language requirement or are just interested in learning a Scandinavian language. With a class size of only one or two students, you also get very individualized feedback on all your work. Overall, I highly recommend this class to anyone even remotely interested in Danish!</comment></course>ANTHRO 2000: Osteoarchaeology Lab</title>This class is hard, but very rewarding. Both Agita and Professor Meadow are very accessible and incredibly helpful - make sure to ask them lots of questions. Go to lab a lot and don't underestimate the amount of time that studying or the final project will take. Don't worry, it can be laid back and lots of fun as well. I've probably learned the more in this class than in any other at college.</comment>One of the most difficult classes I've taken at Harvard, but also one of the most fun. I've definitely learned so much, and I will miss this class!</comment></course>MATH 25a: Honors Linear Algebra and Real Analysis I</title>This course requires a significant amount of work but will give you a really strong understanding of linear algebra and give you the opportunity to work with very smart students.</comment>Take this class if you like math and you're good at it. If you're even remotely considering concentrating in math or a related field, take this class. Be prepared to work hard though. The work load is definitely manageable, and you'll get into a rhythm.</comment>be prepared for hard times and a lot of work and late nights</comment>Tough as tits</comment>Apparently, this year's class was harder than most, so my experience is not representative of what any future experiences might be. That said, this course was killer. Realistically, if you feel that you can keep on top of the material by spending copious amounts of time reviewing it, you'll be fine. Otherwise, it will probably be a struggle.</comment>This was an absolutely fantastic class. It is worth the work and very doable despite the difficulty at times.  Kaletha was marvelous, and I find it unfortunate that he will probably not be teaching the class in the future. Also, the CA's are great and tend to understand your issues as almost all took the class the year previously. Problem sets can take a while and by no means are they easy (that actually depends on the teacher), but they really reinforce your understanding and improve your formal proof-writing ability. Ultimately, if you are interested in theoretical math and willing to put in some time (10-20 hours a week is honestly not too terrible), this a great class and I wholeheartedly recommend it.</comment>The lectures and psets will challenge you, but in the end it's definitely worth it. Kaletha was a truly outstanding professor, and the CAs were friendly and on point. Definitely take this class if you want to jump into higher mathematics. If you're ready to devote the time to it, Math 25 is very rewarding!</comment>Enter with caution.</comment>If you're interested in math and have either taken a linear algebra class or done contest math, Math 25 is probably the right level for you. The first few weeks are generally pretty easy compared to the rest of the course, so be wary for that.</comment>This course is difficult. There is a lot of work, and you have to put in a lot of time going over the notes from class in order to understand what is happening. However, if you do, then you will come out of the class with a pretty good understanding of basic linear algebra. The problem sets will generally take a lot of time during the week, but there should be at least a few problems on each set that are genuinely interesting. Try to find a good balance of doing the problem sets alone and with a good group of people. Don't fall into the trap of working with a group only to find that you are getting the answers without really understanding what is going on. Professor Kaletha is a fantastic teacher. He really cares about his students. He took many of our suggestions about the course, slowing down and altering the form of the course as necessary. His office hours are generally very crowded, both because he is excellent at explaining material one-on-one, but also because he is just a really nice guy that people want to get to know. Overall, if you plan on doing something that is related to math or physics, then this course will definitely be worthwhile. It is not a course I would recommend for those who have to take a math course but who aren't really interested in learning math for math's sake.</comment>Your life will be changed by this class, especially if you come into it straight from AP Calc - I will never see math the same way again. The bulk of the class is writing proofs, which can be a bit non-intuitive but also elegant and enlightening. Be prepared to struggle quite a bit and to devote a significant portion of your life to this course, but the TFs and Professor Kaletha are always there to support you and to help explain things that are a bit fuzzy, and  you'll make some incredibly close friends, bonded by the adversity of weekly p-sets. If you like plug-and-chug math, run away from this class as fast as your legs can carry you, but if you want to understand what mathematics is really all about, then look no further than this.</comment>It's a difficult course, especially under Tasho Kaletha. Expect to spend upwards of 15 hrs a week on the material, but it's definitely a worthwhile course.</comment>It is difficult but very rewarding</comment>Don't be afraid to take on the challenge, especially if you're thinking about concentrating in pure math or some science. It will cause some headaches, but you might realize that your mathematical aptitude is far beyond what you expected.</comment>This course is incredibly well-taught, and you will learn quite a bit of linear algebra. The problems sets are very long, but they are not too challenging. I highly recommend using the Princeton Math 217 notes for reference, as they very closely match what we learn in class. Professor Kaletha is an awesome professor, and a genuinely funny guy.</comment>If Tasho is teaching this class again, definitely take it. I've heard good things about Gross and Gaitsgory, but Tasho was awesome.</comment>I would really recommend this course *to those with a good math background.*  In particular, it helps to be proficient with proofs.  You learn a lot in this course and it can come pretty quickly.  Also, this is different from other linear algebra courses in that it's not very computation-heavy.  While it is a lot of work, the psets really do help you fully understand the content.
Aside from that, I've made some really great friends in this course as well.</comment>This class is very well taught and you will end up learning a lot about linear algebra, proof writing, and abstract thinking. Material may be difficult to understand at first but a month later when you look back at your notes you realize that old material seems trivial. Doing the problems sets was the most work I have ever put into a class but the results were well worth it. Professor Kaletha is a great teacher and really cares that students learn the material.</comment>This course was very well taught. The professor is very friendly and always willing to help; his office hours helped me clear up so many of my questions. The class covers linear algebra in a very formal way and was very valuable. That said, the time commitment is steep and the work was difficult. You should be willing to work hard for this class. Overall, I really enjoyed this class and if you have some interest in formal math you should definitely consider it.</comment>Although the course will definitely be different since Kaletha is leaving next year, it's a fantastic introduction to linear algebra and mathematical thinking -- the class forces you to understand the underpinnings of how linear algebra works, and also made sure that students were familiar with computing things. Although rather fast-paced, there was plenty of time to ruminate on the material and become very comfortable with the material (as opposed to what I've heard about Math 55, for example).</comment>If you want to learn math really well, take this class! It will make you smarter. Above all things, come in with a good attitude and be ready to tackle ideas that may not make sense immediately, but with enough effort they eventually do and are enjoyable to grasp the nuances of.</comment>Be prepared to work really hard, but also be hugely rewarded by that hard work.</comment>The course with Prof. Kaletha was a great experience and I learned an incredible amount. About Linear Algebra specifically and about general techniques which are more broadly applicable.</comment>This class is great!</comment>The course is very difficult, but in terms of what is learned by the end of it, the struggle is well worth it; Jordan Normal form is beautiful. But go in with dedication and love for math. You need to really love math in order to do well at all, or to enjoy yourself at all. Don't be afraid if you put in far more time than you did in your math class in high school, and don't be scared if you feel like you put in far more time than your peers. 1) This is college, and it's nothing like high school. This is a real math class. 2) Ignore your peers, it's not about them. The course is about you and Math, it's about you trying and struggling and failing and struggling more and succeeding to understand. It's about appreciating something that is truly beautiful. And if your happiness is dictated by your performance in comparison to your peers, you're thinking about it wrong. It's about you and Math. That's all there is.

Come in with grit, and determination, and love, because Math requires all of those things from you. If you do, it won't disappoint.</comment>Very difficult. Long and difficult psets, but good lectures.</comment>This class is great! You learn so much and you can feel your brain expand as the class goes on. It's pretty hard and demanding but as long as you're willing to commit a good chunk of time to it you'll be fine. It is very abstract for the most part, so if you're looking to be more of an applied math guy and haven't already taken Multivariable/Linear I would take 21 or 23 instead. But, in general, if you like math, take this class and you won't regret it! Tasho rocks and math is fun.</comment>25a is the most rewarding class I have taken. I was probably among those with the most limited background, having done virtually no proofwriting beforehand. However, by the end of the semester writing proofs was second-nature, and the breadth and depth of the material covered was phenomenal. If you are considering 23 because you are unsure if you have the background for 25, take 25. If you are considering 23 because you are unsure if you want to put the work in for 25, strongly consider the difference in quality and material between the two courses. Perhaps most importantly, 25 will teach you to think solely in the abstract. Gaining understanding from examples and visuals can be advantageous, but I now feel that it is secondary to gaining a complete, abstract notion of a topic. The former is, of course, closer to the approach of 23, while the latter is that of 25.</comment>This isn't the 25a of years past. This course is very, very hard. Kaletha is a superb lecturer, and the material is usually extremely interesting. But think seriously about whether this course is right for you if you do not have serious mathematical maturity/background. You will gain the most from the class if you've taken linear algebra already, and want to gain further insight into the material. Remember how crucial it is to review lecture notes constantly, and do not work on the psets alone. Prepare to see a lot of material very quickly, and expect you might find yourself lost along the way, or occasionally stare at a problem you have no clue how to start. Ultimately a worthwhile but very challenging experience.</comment>Math 25 was an incredibly rewarding course. I learned how to really think analytically and develop a passion for math. Though it can be very challenging at times, it all pays off in the end, and I know for a fact that I came out of the class much more confident in my ability than I came into it.</comment>This is a great course. You learn a ton, not just about linear algebra but about math. About how real math works and about how real math classes work. If you stick with it you won't regret it. Coincidentally you need to put in a ton of work. And a ton of your own work. There is no textbook so your notes are the text book. So you need to take notes. You make your experience in this class.</comment>It will be the most important and hardest class in your schedule, but if you love math it is a great course to take where putting in the work is very rewarding.</comment>This is a great class that covers a lot of linear algebra and the camaraderie of the class is incredible, BUT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. If you did not take linear algebra in high school, even if you were USAMO-level, I would recommend taking a lower level math class. There's no reason to kill yourself freshman fall with math. It was a great learning experience but also added a lot of stress, not to mention a deflated ego.</comment>Make no mistake- this course is very challenging for almost anyone, even those with substantial high school math background. The problem sets generally take an average of 1-2 hours per problem to solve (each pset averages around 10 problems), and unlike in any high school math class, understanding the material requires a consistent and significant effort to review the material several times after each lecture. This, on top of problem sets, makes this class easily take up 15-20 hours per week, or potentially even more. That being said, if you enjoy math and are willing/able to put in the time, the course is infinitely rewarding because it allows you to appreciate the beauty of mathematics since the course starts from "naive set theory" and proceeds to some extremely elegant results in linear algebra. If Prof. Kaletha is teaching, be sure to take extremely careful notes because there is no textbook or online notes, which sounds like a bad thing in some ways, but actually it's really helpful in forcing you to be precise- and precision is key to succeeding in Math 25. Good luck!</comment>This course varies a lot according to its teacher but Math 25a under Kaletha was amazing. Sometimes with higher math, the notation can get in the way of what is actually going on but the way Kaletha taught it, you could really use the notation to work for you on even on the most difficult problems.</comment>Be ready to struggle.  It's a great class for those that know what they want, and what they want is a challenge.  The course material was extremely interesting, the professor was great, and I had a great experience until I got my midterm grade back.  Just know what you are getting yourself into.  If you want a mathematical challenge, this is the class for you.</comment>I've learned a ton at the expense of GPA. That said, I feel like I wasn't nearly as prepared as others.</comment>This is probably the most difficult class I've ever taken, though I don't regret it for a second. Professor Kaletha made the course a whole lot more difficult than it was in past years, so a lot of my experience comes from having the increased difficulty of 25. Make sure to go to sections early and get a solid foundation of earlier concepts and problems, so that later stuff is easier to tackle. If you are looking into math/physics as a possible concentration, I highly recommend this class.</comment>The Mathematics Department website described this class as one where "homework can take from seven to fifteen hours per week to complete." I would argue that this year, the course was far harder than anyone could have imagined. As a possible math concentrator, I was very interested and excited for a mathematical challenge. After having taken this course, I realize that mathematics was far more difficult than I could have imagined. I spent around twenty to thirty hours a week on this course, and so did most other students. By far, this was the course this semester where I felt that I definitely learned the most. I definitely appreciate just how much I came to understand about linear algebra. But in terms of recommendations, unless you are willing to put in boatloads of work and are extremely interested in mathematics, you may not want to take this course, especially if someone new is teaching it.</comment>Push through it and you will not regret it.</comment>Again, I think you just have to be interested in math and willing to take a challenging course, and if you are, then you'll get a lot out of the course.</comment>TAKE THIS COURSE. If you do not hate pure math, give it a try. This course is a wonderful choice. Professor Kaletha is amazing. Honestly, I think that in terms of math the course material does not matter that much - the professor matters a lot. I sometimes stay at his office hour for an extra hour, and he patiently answered all my questions without complaining about not having dinner. Prof Kaletha knows exactly at what point of the proof we may feel confused about and he would explain super-clearly. If you see prof Kaletha's course next time, just take it. I came here thinking about being a Gov or Social Studies major, but this course made me seriously consider doing math.</comment>This course was difficult, but rewarding. I would encourage anyone who wants to go into math, physics, or even computer science to take this course.</comment>If Tasho is teaching this course, absolutely take it. You'll have to work hard, but you will be thoroughly rewarded.</comment>Math 25a is challenging, but doable. I did not have extensive experience in proof-based mathematics before taking this course, but gained a new appreciation for math and a better ability after taking it. Plan to devote a good amount of time to this class. I would have benefited from not having too many other obligations that caused me to often cram the material and assignments into small time slots.</comment>Be careful of the extreme difficulty of the problem sets in this course.There is no book of section notes and it requires a heavy amount of work that will override all of your other courses and extracurriculars.</comment>Kaletha goes hard--Math 25a this year is definitely more difficult than it used to be, but still it is very intellectually inviting and intriguing. Just as Kaletha said, the study of math is not that you look at the material and understand it. Often you look at it and say "what the hell" and look at it again and say "what the hell" and look for the third time and start to understand it. But when you finally get it, the feeling of accomplishment is fantastic! If you're interested in math, definitely take this class!</comment></course>SCRB 10: Human Developmental and Regenerative Biology</title>This class is REALLY experimentally based. It is very hard to study for this--it's more like you get it or you don't, which is frustrating. Sometimes the midterm answers will be really vague, and it's hard to know what they're actually looking for. Content is really interesting though.</comment>I loved this class, even though I was pretty bad at it, because the material was so fascinating. Knowing how stem cells work is pretty sweet. No lab, but there's a decent focus on understanding/applying experiments. A lot of the exam questions are things like "design an experiment for this scenario" I'd recommend it, even though it's not easy</comment>Take SCRB 10, HDRB concentrator or not! SCRB 10 has been my favorite biology / science class ever! Bill Anderson and Kevin Eggan are great and have super interesting discussions in lecture and in office hours. The class is focused more on critically thinking about what are interesting problems in biology and how can we answer them, rather than memorizing names of proteins - because of that, I feel that I truly grew in my ability to think analytically, and that this class will stay with me for years, rather than dissipating into the recesses of my memory. Section is also great and really helps with the lecture material - there's a lot of support in the course and friendly TF's, and every lecture is so incredibly interesting! You will not be disappointed in this class - one of the highlights of my whole semester.</comment>First of, this is an AMAZING course! You learn some of the most interesting material in biology and a deeper appreciation of the field.   Some positives of the class -you gain a lot of relevant skills in biology research (experiment planning, analyzing research papers, problem solving) -you are exposed to a wide range of topics (regeneration, aging, development) -Bill is an awesome lecturer! -questions can be really fun  negatives -you can get really frustrated at pset/test questions -Cre vs CreER will be the bane of your semester -this is not the easiest class grade-wise...</comment>This course will help you decide what concentration you want to take in the biologys. Definitely shop this class. It is definitely a lot of work, but certainly worthwhile</comment>The exams are hard, but the lectures are very interesting.</comment>SCRB 10 is the best class I have taken at Harvard so far. It gives you the tools to be a better critical thinker, rather than forcing you to memorize countless facts. What you learn in this class can be applied to all future biology courses you take. Take it!</comment>SCRB10 will definitely help you grow as a researcher and teach you experimental methods that are widely used in science. The problem sets took time, but as there are only three, the balance with difficulty level is fair. I would definitely recommend this course to those who have little background in research. Bill is an amazing lecturer and puts in a lot of effort into this class (he graded our writing assignments!).</comment>it is a challenge but very interesting</comment>This is an incredible opportunity to learn about what's happening at the forefront of the scientific world. It has real world application and will almost certainly blow your mind at one point or another.</comment>The teaching staff is great. If you're mildly interested in stem cells, leaving the class you will thoroughly enjoy stem cells.</comment>Learn Cre! And remember, when in doubt...Cre.</comment>Don't focus on details learn how to use the scientific tools/ technology to designs experiments. Become very comfortable with designing experiments, which is a very different way of thinking than most are used to.</comment>The subject matter is really interesting, but the exams and assignments are tough, with the exception of the writing assignments. It doesn't have lab and the time required isn't bad, but you have to put in a LOT of extra work to actually do well. It's hard to do well in this course.</comment>As long as you've taken LS1a or LPSA, and LS1b, you should be fine.</comment>This class is quite difficult, especially because the exams are way longer than they should be. The psets take 5-10 hours as well.</comment>Take this class as a gen ed, its biology, but its fun.</comment>The grading in this class is very arbitrary.  There was a ridiculously short amount of time for the 1st midterm.  They mostly emphasize experimental tools rather than tiny details about each developmental process you learn, but hey they like to throw those in sometimes too.</comment>This class was amazing. It was extremely difficult, but it was amazing. You will never get bored in lecture (it's stem cells, how can you?!). The material we learned was so incredibly interesting but the hard part is this class tests on your ability to respond to a scenario using the techniques we learned, so it's not something you just cram for; you really have to know what the techniques are and when to use them and how to combine them. That being said, it all comes together by the end and I'm really excited to continue on as an HDRB concentrator!</comment>SCRB 10 is an amazing class. It doesn't just teach you facts about biology but it shows you how to solve problems, set up experiments, and approach scientific papers.</comment>It's very interesting but very hard.</comment>Not a cakewalk and evaluations are often frustrating, but this material is compelling and worth the struggle.</comment>This is a very interesting class, but it is very tough. The exams require you to think creatively, as you design experiments. They also don't give you enough practice problems to do well in understanding the concepts.</comment>SCRB10 is a must-take class! All the lectures are really interesting and Bill is such an amazing lecturer! It's somewhat difficult to get used to the types of questions they ask on the test, but Bill and the TFs are always super helpful in office hours and the section handouts are good for practicing.</comment>The material is very interesting, but the assignments and exams may be confusing and make you extremely frustrating.</comment>This class is not easy but it is one of the best science classes I have taken at Harvard so far. In the past I've often felt that there was lots of busy work and things were unnecessarily difficult. I did not feel that way about this class. Everything you learn is extremely relevant right now. All the work is to help you learn the material and to make you think in new ways, instead of just giving you something to do. The material is not easy but I found it so interesting that putting the time in to understand it was not a problem.</comment>best class</comment>This course is challenging, but tests you in a new format that changes the way you think about science. Far more engaging than standard freshman year biology classes. The content feels very relevant to modern science, and by the end, you will likely have a good understanding of the essentials of stem cell biology. Even if you don't want to concentrate in HDRB, this class is definitely worth it. Ensure that you are solid with the cre(er)/lox system and tet system as they come up in class!</comment>SCRB 10 definitely pushes you to think about biology in a way that you might not have done before. It emphasizes experimental design and application as opposed to memorization, which I thought made it far more interesting than any biology class I'd taken in the past. Bill is a wonderful lecturer and explains things extremely clearly. My one complaint is that I didn't feel TFs were super available to answer questions I had about problem sets. Some are more literal about the restrictions on not giving the answers away than others, so definitely find the right TF's office hours to go to (I had Julie and found her to be more helpful than most).</comment>I enjoyed SCRB10 but I found some aspects of the course challenging. The teaching staff expects you to be proactive about your own learning - they will not guide you through learning like they do in LS1a and LS1b. You should make sure you are very careful about timing on the exams. It helps to study every week or every other week so that you do not forget the material and so that studying for exams and doing problem sets is easier.</comment>Amazing class</comment>SCRB10 is so far my favorite class at Harvard. Two weeks into the class was enough for me to be completely sure that I want to concentrate in HDRB. Bill Anderson is THE MAYOR. He runs this town, and it's beautiful.</comment>DO NOT TAKE THIS IF YOU ARE NOT HDRB. I'm honestly really interested in the material (stem cell development and uses, developing HSCs in vitro, etc.) but was honestly disappointed with my experience with the course. My TF was bad, kind of condescending and patronizing. I think she knew I was nonHDRB and had a problem with that or something. When no one would/could answer a question in section, I was cold-called several times. I am the only one in the section to have this happen. Also, there are not enough evaluations to ensure that you are keeping up with material. Instead of 3 big psets, why not give a smaller pset each week or every other week? Not sure what the rationale was for cramming the psets together. I think Bill and Kevin are fine. Bill basically runs the course, and having more Kevin Eggan would have been cool. I think the best lecture all year came from Kevin's discussion of enhancement toward the end of the year. Also, this class is 95% premed, which is basically a cult. Get used to nonstop talk about chem17 and other premed horrors. Yawn. It also makes the class kind of cutthroat which kind of sucks for a cool class. Some improvements should be made. It's fine for HDRB concentrators, but as a nonconcentrator, I cannot recommend this class.</comment>Make sure to ask questions as soon as they arise because a lot of the times they will not simply work themselves out. This is mostly a result of needing to know exactly what is being asked of you and how to respond to experimental design questions.</comment>Not the easiest class to deal with in terms of grades, but doable if you are willing to put in the time to figure out the assignments.  As an intro to the HDRB concentration, I definitely think it is worth it to take this class.  The material is very interesting and you will leave knowing many ways to make mice glow!</comment>Although lecture material is interesting and the professors are great, other aspects of the course need improvement and make me hesitate to recommend it unless you're set on HDRB. Having research experience is a definite benefit for this class. Otherwise, it felt very abstract to learn in depth about very specific research techniques while having no lab component to the course. While it was interesting to learn about experimental techniques during lecture and how they're being used in stem research today, having to answer questions on designing experiments with these techniques we've never conducted felt very contrived, since real life research is so much more complicated than what a short answer question can offer. Exams and problem sets were very difficult, partly because of challenging concepts but largely because of the way questions were worded. It was hard to predict what Susi the preceptor, who writes all the questions, wanted exactly in her answers, especially for some questions that were very vague or hinged on the interpretation of one word. Grading on problem sets and exams was very harsh if you misinterpreted the wording or explained your answer in a different way, and often seemed to test how well you understand the wording rather than whether you understood the material. Not all of the teaching staff was good. Some of the TFs are really great, but others were not devoted to the course and don't really know what's going on most of the time. Susi the preceptor is very harsh, doesn't answer questions in a helpful manner, and is not very supportive or kind towards students. Lecture notes are helpful. Practice problems are needed to do well on exams, but I felt there were not enough in preparation for the midterms. Cramming for exams is NOT recommended!

Nonetheless, lecture material is interesting if you're into developmental biology and stem cell research, and Professors Anderson and Eggan are both very enthusiastic and helpful. They're not really involved with the class assignments (psets and exams are all written by Susi), but they're very accessible to talk with about all sorts of related topics after lecture and during office hours.</comment>Not a conventional biology course. Learning question and exam formats early on would be beneficial.</comment>If you really pay attention and get into the material and lectures, you'll find that what you are learning is very, very interesting! But the structure of tests and section problems makes it hard to ever really know if you answered correctly</comment>Be sure to understand the Cre Lox system early, and the Tetracycline systems immediately after they are introduced. 

Find a study group. Don't work on this alone. The questions are tricky and require a lot of critical thinking, which is best done in a group.</comment>In order to get the most out of SCRB 10, I would suggest going over the lectures notes both before and after lecture. Before lecture, take a quick look at the uploaded lecture notes without the annotations and then after lecture, read through the annotations to make sure you understand everything. This is very important because it prepares you for future lectures, and prevents the hassle of trying to cram for an exam that you cannot cram for by virtue of the subject matter. I would also suggest getting comfortable with the cre-lox system as soon as it is introduced.</comment>Obviously if you are doing HDRB you'll have to take this course.  Can be really interesting at times, might have been better if I'd had a better section leader.  Problem sets are really hard- you need to work with a lot of people.  I alternated between feeling like this course was tedious and hard and being fascinated and excited by what I was learning.</comment>To not take it. This class only makes you feel horrible about yourself and your ability to learn science</comment>Don't get jittery during midterms. Read every question carefully. Don't write paragraphs.</comment>This is one of the most interesting courses I have ever taken. I absolutely loved the lectures and really looked forward to attending them.</comment>If you want a course which will challenge you and teach you how to think, this is the course for you! Bill Anderson makes this course phenomenal and this was the first course at Harvard where I feel like I really learnt to think critically in a way that I hadn't before.</comment>Such an interesting course. Not hard if you put the time into it. The problem sets and tests are definitely doable. The teaching staff is wonderful and very approachable.</comment></course>FRSEMR 48e: Health and Mental Health in Everyday Life</title>Be sure to spend time evaluating the readings because they will not only help writing the essays, but you will learn a lot more and be better at engaging in discussion.</comment>If you are at all interested in the topics covered in this course, apply to take it! Professor Ruggie is awesomely interesting and excited to share her wealth of knowledge with you. The readings each week are totally manageable and engaging.</comment>She's really chill and you'll enjoy the comfortable learning environment. Participate frequently and you'll get more out of it.</comment>It is a great way to learn more health inequalities and to begin thinking about how to solve them.</comment>There is tough material mentally so be ready to question the world around you</comment>It's really nice to have a class that is fairly low maintenance. Also, it's nice to have a group of people who you get to know really well by the end of semester.</comment></course>ECON 985k: Research in Macroeconomics, Finance, and Modeling</title>If you're doing an AM/Ec thesis get into 985. I got denied at first and wiggled my way in, it's super helpful at keeping you on track. Stata psets are a complete waste of time and energy but TFs are really helpful when your advisor just bounces for a month!</comment>If you are an economics or applied math economics student interesting in thesis writing, this class is a must-take. coming into the semester, I underestimated how much time it takes to do research. this class has helped guide me by making sure I'm making progress every week and helping me set periodic deadlines for myself, which is what you need. also having yao as an instructor has been extremely helpful. he's super quick getting back to you with advice, so if you're interested in financial economics, try to get into his section!</comment>It is time consuming, especially the STATA tutorial if you haven't done it already. It is best to go hard organizationally early on so later in the semester you aren't crunched for time.</comment>Take advantage of this course as much as possible! Your section leader is there to help you.</comment>Writing a thesis will rank among the most engaging intellectual experiences at Harvard.</comment>The thesis seminar is required if you want to write an Ec thesis. However, I can only speak for Yao, who was not the most organised or most helpful section leader.</comment></course>PHYSICS 15c: Wave Phenomena</title>This course taught by Hailu was very unorganized. Psets had many mistakes and typos which were corrected near the deadline without notice. The chosen problems on psets were not very helpful. Exams were difficult and arbitrarily graded. No practice problems were given in preparation for exams, even upon request. Lectures were confusing and there were sometimes mistakes in lecture. The textbook doesn't have all the material taught in the course.</comment>You take the course because you have to.</comment>material is fairly difficult</comment>15c is still a pretty difficult class. Girma was good, but psets and exams were pretty tough overall.</comment>Great class that prepares you well for quantum mechanics.</comment>Physics 15c is the last rite of passage in the Physics 15 series before quantum mechanics. It is a solid course with a unique offering of material. The labs are also much more interesting than the labs on Physics 16/15a and Physics 15b. Despite its unique offering of material, the material is definitely manageable, and in a way repetitive. By the end of the semester, the entire physics 15c course is just applications of the wave equation and solving with certain boundary conditions.</comment>The material covered in this class is genuinely interesting, but if you aren't a physics major can sometimes seem a bit pointless. Although as an EE, I felt some things were incredibly helpful to see from a more mathematical/physics background. Also, if Girma's teaching, think twice. He speeds through lectures, and skips over important derivations often. Also no practice materials were ever provided for any of the exams, so just keep that in mind... Although the lab component with Markus was fantastic, super chill and low stress, but interesting and enjoyable.</comment>The class's difficulty stems from its confusing structure, little feedback, arbitrary grading, absence of practice problems, error-filled p-sets, lackluster section, and unclear lectures. Prof. Hailu was a confusing lecturer and did not provide adequate or often correct course materials; also he assumed that the class understood ideas when that was not the case.</comment>In my opinion, you won't learn very much new physics in this class, but you will learn new methods you can use to quantitatively analyze systems that you're probably already somewhat familiar with (diffraction, lenses, the wave equation, etc.)</comment>This course was well taught by Professor Hailu. The exams were fair and were not exceedingly difficult to crush the morale of students. The PSET questions helped the student master key concepts and the section taught by Michael was useful. The lab component of the course need some work. Although I enjoyed the content of lab, I had trouble understanding the underlying mathematics/physics because topics did not overlap well with lab. 

Each PSET take about 6-10 hours, and I would recommend studying every single one of them for the tests.</comment>Great class to take if you are interested in waves! Professor Hailu is a great professor and explains the materials very well.</comment>Great class, I learned a lot. I am an engineering major, and I feel waves is a really important topic because a lot of the latest technology is based on optics, and also quantum mechanics ((imp for nanotechnology) naturally follows from wave phenomena. It is very well taught, and the lab component is also great, much better than 15a and 15b's.</comment>Can be wildly different between semesters with the different instructors.</comment>This class presented a number of useful ideas, but was rather dull. The teaching staff cared about the students, but the atmosphere of the course - so few students in a giant lecture hall - made lecture unenjoyable. The problem sets were oddly worded and contained many errors that students ended up correcting themselves. The exams were oddly structured, so that doing well was not necessarily connected to studying or understanding the material. This class was helpful, but I would be careful before deciding to take it.</comment></course>SOC-STD 98ng: Heidegger and Social Thought</title>You don't have to do all the readings. Take your time with the blog posts and write a thoughtful response. You'll get more in return from your classmates. Start doing the research for your paper early. Take the time to meet with Rodrigo. Take him to faculty dinner!</comment>Best course I've taken at Harvard, thus far.</comment>This was one of the best seminars I've taken at Harvard. If you're even a little interested in doing theory for Social Studies, this is the tutorial to do. The readings are dense but the class taught me so much.</comment>This class prepared me to engage 20th Century philosophy in a deep an nuanced way. One of the best most shaping classes I've taken at Harvard.</comment></course>SANSKRIT 250r: Nth Year Sanskrit: Seminar</title>If you are interested in logic, in Indian philosophy, and in new intellecutals, Navya Nyaya will have many surprises for you, and this course will be a smooth transition into its tiger-like dire (vyāghramukhī) language and concepts.</comment></course>SWAHILI B: Intermediate Swahili</title>This course is too disorganized for words to accurately describe. The TF had not plan; it was kind of like she decided to teach the first thing that came to her mind that morning/afternoon. There was just no order at all.</comment>There are no other options if you want to study intermediate Swahili, but the course has so few in-class hours (2/week) and little homework so I did not end up learning that much. If you want to learn more I would recommend organizing a Swahili language table and doing independent studying along with the class.</comment>It's a great way to learn Swahili</comment></course>ENG-SCI 259: Advanced Introduction to Robotics</title>Learned a lot, but it's a busy class. Lab and HW alternate weeks.</comment>The class was interesting, but focused entirely on robot arms instead of mobile robots. Very challenging amount of linear algebra and geometry.</comment>The course is pretty comprehensive but taught in a digestible manner.</comment></course>AFRAMER 16: Sociology of the Black Community</title>This is a very interesting class. By the end you have learned a lot about the problems facing the black community today. Take this course if you are interested in the modern day black community, you'll learn a ton!</comment>Great course, covers a lot of material. Quite a lot of work (nearly a book a week, weekly reaction papers, long take-home mid-term and final exams) but it pays off!</comment>Didn't live up to the hype, but definitely informative if you're interested in the black-white inequity of America</comment>This was the best class I have taken at Harvard. It covered many important topics pertaining to the black community, and Professor Bobo is a great lecturer and discussion facilitator. Stay on top of reading and the midterm and final paper won't be too bad. Take this class!!</comment>Don't be fooled by it being "22"- this class is pretty demanding. Lots of reading (a book+ each week). Response papers are graded pretty harshly. Demanding mid-term and final take-home exams (which are really just long papers). However, if you are willing to put the time in this course is totally worth it!</comment>Great class and great discussion!</comment>This class teaches you a lot about the black experience in America today, and I wouldn't necessarily say that there is a particular agenda that Professor Bobo has.  Come in with an open mind and don't be afraid to butt heads with your peers.  I wish I did more of that, to be honest.</comment>This course is awesome! I really enjoyed the environment and learned so much that is relevant to society today. Just know that the midterm and final are significant lengths (10-15 & 20 pages respectively), but doable. I loved it!</comment>Take notes throughout the readings to make writing the papers easier.</comment>This class is really wonderful and the readings are extremely insightful and interesting.  This class was an eye-opnening experience and I am really glad I took it.  Make sure you pace the readings out and don't fall behind on them!</comment>Prepare to be engaged with Professor Bobo and to read a lot of material.</comment>You will learn much.</comment>This class is really interesting and engaging.  Being able to discuss the aspects of the black community was extremely enlightening.</comment>It requires a serious time commitment but it rewarding to say the least</comment>This class taught me to think and develop sociological arguments in historical and modern contexts. It led me to deeply consider the black American experience and what changes need to occur to educate the public and create solutions for the racial inequality in our country.</comment>- Schedule out how you will do the reading. The reading in the course is really good actually but I never got to finish most of the books.</comment>Take this class!!! In a small setting, you learn sociological explanations for issues of racial inequality that are central to modern society. No class has sparked more out-of-class discussions than Sociology of the Black Community--not just with classmates but also with roommates, people you're eating dinner with, and random students who ask what classes you're taking. The syllabus follows a clear structure and includes really interesting reading materials. Also Bobo's lectures pair well with the readings.</comment>This is in general a great course but my only caveat would be come ready for discussion, it wasn't billed as a discussion course but it is and is driven by the discussion the group has, so if you have a great group of people you'll have an amazing course experience, if not then probably not</comment></course>ECON 2020a: Microeconomic Theory I</title>In its current (F2014) iteration, this course is extremely effective at meeting the goals of most students. Students in the class are generally PhD students from Public Policy, Gov, and MIT Sloan School PhD students. Some students have strong backgrounds in micro theory, but some have almost none (myself included). Nonetheless, Prof. Kotowski is extremely clear as a lecturer, and made the key concepts very tangible. The assignments are difficult but Credit/No Credit. The exams are challenging but much partial credit is given for solutions that are on track. Overall, I would recommend this course to Public Policy / Gov PhD students who want to get a better handle on micro theory. MBA-type business school students may be disappointed by how micro theory has relatively practical applications in actually running a business. Even so, the academic-track business PhD seems to enjoy the class and think it helpful, from my conversations with them.</comment>Maciej is an excellent teacher, and if you are interested in microeconomics, I strongly recommend taking this class.</comment>Maciej is really good at comprehensively teaching the core theory of microeconomics. If you have a lot of background in mathematics, the class is really not that hard. Some students struggled though who were less prepared for this sort of theoretical work.</comment>Unlike other courses that resemble banging your head against the wall, this class will have returns proportional to the time invested to it. There are real benefits to mastering the material in terms of policy work. Macej is great!</comment>If you have never taken intermediate microeconomic theory, you will find this class incredibly difficult. However, I doubt I have ever had a more supportive teaching team for any course I have taken in Harvard - you will have help whenever you need it, and the structure of the course could even be adjusted to meet the class needs (For example, sections were modified a bit in the latter half of the course to focus more on problem solving). What was most helpful for me? Solving as many problems as possible, over and over again. If you decide to take this course, it will probably be hard and take a ton of time, but if you stick with it, you'll take so much with you!</comment>This is an informative and enjoyable course that I would highly recommend. But it is also a significant amount work, and it is very helpful to have a solid background in microeconomic theory.</comment>This class is a lot of hard work but the syllabus is carefully constructed to help you learn. It's apparent that Professor Kotowski cares a lot about his teaching.</comment>fantastic course, would definitely recommend that you attend and make sure to go to lectures</comment>Maciej is a fantastic professor. He and the TFs put a great deal of effort into teaching. I thoroughly enjoyed taking this class.</comment>This course is a good introduction to PhD-level microeconomic theory. It's not quite at the level of MWG but is still fairly mathematical. Lots of thought goes into exam and homework problems, which is great. The material is also builds on itself nicely.

You will leave the course with a good understanding of how economists traditionally use mathematics to understand human decision making.</comment>The course requires a lot of work, but it is overall extremely rewarding.</comment>If you really want a solid theoretical foundation in microeconomics at the graduate level in order to do rigorous economic research, then this is an excellent introductory course to familiarize yourself with underlying concepts, tools, and methods upon which more advanced research in the field is built. If you are more interested in applied microeconomics in a specific field, then this course will likely not be so interesting and I would recommend just purchasing the textbook as a reference and jumping directly into a subject-area course (you can likely teach yourself the concepts that will be relevant to you and spend less time working on things that you will likely never use again). Again, still a great course but really consider what your goals are in taking it.</comment>Great professor, makes material interesting, problem sets time consuming but very good</comment>Maciej is an excellent instructor. Seriously, take anything he's teaching. He is very good at explaining complicated things in a clear and understandable way. He is also very approachable.</comment>Good course -- worth pursuing.</comment></course>SCI-LIVSYS 12: Understanding Darwinism</title>This is a great class. Fun and you'll learn a lot if you don't study science. The professors are incredible. If you need an SLS, take this.</comment>This is an interesting way to fulfill your SLS requirement. You'll learn some material that will engage you more than you might expect, but you won't be taxed in a way that would distract from your other academic commitments.</comment>Changed my view of the world. My favorite class of the semester. Excellent teaching.</comment>Definitely the best way to fulfill the science of living systems requirement -- and Professor Berry's lectures are honestly a joy to attend; he's hilarious. I'm not a science person at all -- this is the first science course I've taken at Harvard -- but he made learning the "science" half of the course an actual pleasure, which was so unexpected. Also, I think the course really succeeded in connecting the material to real, current-day debates. TAKE THIS COURSE IF YOU'RE FROM A SMALL TOWN OR THE DEEP SOUTH WHERE NO ONE BELIEVES IN EVOLUTION. I'm so prepared for debates now!</comment>This class was extremely eye-opening to the often overused/misrepresented aspects of Darwin's works. Dr. Berry is an extremely engaging lecturer and classes were interesting and well taught. Recommend!</comment>As a music concentrator I still found like I got a lot of stuff out of this class. Wholeheartedly recommend. One lab satiates that "pooh a lab" thing. Assignments not too heavy. Origin really interesting to read. Lectures both very entertaining and engaging as well as good cogent explanations of the material. Sections review the lectures from the previous week (genius) and Origin of Species book. Exam/midterm good level of difficulty. And the history of science stuff (Go Professor Browne!) puts this super important theory (evolution) in historical context in a really cool way.</comment>Second half of the course is difficult but it is very interesting. Dr. Berry and Dr. Browne do a great job with lecture.</comment>very fun and extremely well taught</comment>A fun enjoyable class, but be prepared to learn a lot of material!</comment>Great class, light workload.  Dr. Berry and Dr. Browne both give great lectures.</comment>This class is a good SLS for non-science people. Professors Brown and Berry are really funny and try to make the material accessible and engaging. Exams are pretty hard, even if you have been to every lecture and section, so make sure you study!!!!</comment>The first half of this class is history of science and the second is more about evolutionary biology. Sections are the best!</comment>This is a fantastic way to fulfill the SLS requirement.  It is not difficult, the lectures are great, and I learned a lot.  Definitely the best gen ed I've taken at Harvard.</comment>As everyone else will probably say, this is a great class for non-science types to fulfill their SLS. I basically took this class because of Andrew Berry. He's fantastic, and everyone should take a class with him. Be warned, the class is very heavily stacked to the second half of the semester, which actually suited me well, but with a 10 page research paper and a 3 hours final, it's a heavy load for a gen ed in finals.</comment>This class is extraordinary.  Take it if you have any love of science or evolution.  Dr. Berry is amazing. Worth attending Harvard just for him.</comment>This class is fairly easy over the semester (light workload) but most of the grade is based on the final paper and final exam, which makes reading and final period pretty tough.</comment>You do no have to deal with science until after the midterm, but once it begins, it comes on strong.</comment>Not much feedback from teachers and section leaders.</comment>It's a great class if you enjoy great lectures (especially from Dr. Andrew Berry, who is an absolute legend).  The sections and tests, however, seem oddly detached from the material you grow to love through lecture, so take with some caution.</comment>Very interesting and engaging, although maybe not the absolute simplest and easiest, way to fulfill SLS. Andrew Berry is possibly the best lecturer I have ever had the pleasure of learning from. The material is fascinating, especially to those with a slight interest yet little background in genetics. The problem sets aren't too bad. The midterm is a little annoying because it focuses primarily on the history of science component of the course. No reading is required except the weekly Darwin chapters, and even those can be skipped sometimes despite the weekly chapter questions. However, if you want to do well on psets and tests, you need to go to lecture. There are no outlines, and lecture slides are not helpful for learning what was taught in class. You need to sit through lecture and take notes to know what was taught in class. In preparing for tests, your notes are pretty much the only thing you have. Overall, I wouldn't describe this as a "gem" GenEd. However, if you need SLS and are interested in evolution and evolutionary biology and want some of the funniest, most engaging lectures you will ever get, take this class.</comment>This is a great class to take.  The lectures are fun and enjoyable.</comment>This class is very easy and incredibly dynamically taught.</comment>An fun-ish and easy gened, if that's what you're looking for. Probably won't really change how you think.</comment>Take this class for the lectures: Berry is a star and Browne is the world's foremost Darwin biographer. The first half of the class (history of Darwinism) is definitely more interesting than the second (inheritance and population genetics); if you've taken AP Bio in high school, most of the science will be review.</comment>There is not a lot of work, but it is hard to do really well on the exams</comment>This is the greatest SLS class for people afraid of science. Andrew Berry is a hilarious lecturer and Janet can hold her own as well. The section leaders are all great, and Evan is especially personable and helpful! I really enjoyed the applicable nature of this course's commentary on sexual selection and religion vs. science. Having shopped all SLS courses with a Q-score of 4 and above, I'm glad I settled on this one!</comment>It is hard to understand what you know and what you do not. I thought I understood what was going on in lectures, but when it came to the midterm I had trouble articulating what I knew even though I understood a lot of the material. I did not use the vocabulary they were looking for even though I had few ways of knowing what they were looking for. Section does not have much to do with class and we continue reading Origin of Species long after we finish with darwin in class.</comment>I surprisingly enjoyed this class! If you took AP bio in high school and did well, this class will be a breeze. First half is history of science: situating The Origin of Species within history (the religious and scientific thought leading up to the publication, and social movements that it spawned afterwards); second half is some basic evolutionary biology: how do species arise, what is sexual selection, considering the fossil record, etc. Pretty interesting stuff, and also seriously the easiest class I've taken at Harvard (senior, in stem)</comment>A little tricky for a non-science concentrator, but interesting material, particularly in terms of understanding and taking a stand for science in contemporary debates about evolution.</comment>This course is not difficult. It is well taught, and Andrew Berry makes lectures endlessly entertaining. If you're looking for an interesting, manageable SLS course, this is the one for you. If you want to delve deep into the subject matter, look elsewhere.</comment>This class gets much harder towards the end. Grading feels arbitrary at times, and it is frustrating that we never get to know why we got points marked off. Not a bad class, not great. I wish now that I had taken SLS20 or Social Psych.</comment>This class is very interesting, especially the history of science component.  At times though they go through the biology and science components a bit quickly and do not do a good job of explaining that material.</comment>This is the best SLS gen-ed. It is not exceptionally hard, and Professors Berry and Browne strive to make it a truly liberal arts gen-ed experience. Take this class if you want an SLS that is relaxed, but will still teach you a thing or two. On top of that, Browne is the leading biographer on Charles Darwin, and Berry is the leading biographer on Alfred Russel Wallace, co-published with Darwin. Who better to teach you how to understand Darwinism?</comment>Andrew Berry may well be the best lecturer at Harvard, and Janet Browne one of the world's top Darwin experts. This is a great class as an elective or if you need to fulfill an SLS requirement. If you have a biology background it will be very easy, if not the second half of the course will be useful but a bit more challenging.</comment>Andrew Berry is hilarious and makes the 1.5 hour lectures pretty enjoyable. The first half of the semester is a tad more boring only because Janet's voice is so soothing when she teaches.</comment>Professors are fun and upbeat, but lectures still drag. Make sure you attend them though, because they aren't recorded and the slides don't tell the whole story. Make sure you study for the exams. There are no trick questions, but if it was mentioned in lecture, it can be on the exam.</comment>This class was a lot of fun. You get to learn about Darwinism in its historical context (beyond even just Darwin himself) and some of the basic science about modern genetics. The class per se is not though, but don't take the work too lightly. "The Origins" can be a little bit dry and take longer to read even if you are a fast reader. Otherwise, a good way to fulfill SLS without it feeling like a cop out.</comment>Janet browne and Andrew Berry are fantastic, they taught me so much and I always felt like I could stand out in class despite the size of the course. Also just a really cool way to learn more about darwin and the history of evolution in general.</comment>The course is easy, but the work is really backloaded (10 page paper and surprisingly hard final). While Berry is an entertaining lecturer, there's a reason no one went to lecture: they're mostly useless. Yea he's funny, but it frequently felt like the primary objective of the class was to make jokes, not explain concepts. We ended up wasting a lot of time in section learning the material instead, and never covered any of the readings. The lab takes up several classes and a section, and yet there's no written report due, WTF? Apparently one of the sections didn't even finish the lab, and it just didn't matter at all.They basically put the bare minimum number of requirements on the syllabus to qualify as a gen ed, but it's really poorly put synthesized (for example, a scientific final paper, but you don't get assigned even ONE SINGLE SCIENTIFIC PAPER to read in the entire course. You're just supposed to randomly know how to write one). If you want an easy class, take it, but the only useful material will be whatever you do on your own, and it won't matter for your grade.</comment>Great and fun way to fulfill the SLS requirement. Both Dr. Berry and Dr. Browne are engaging and entertaining. You also will learn a thing or two.</comment>Not a heavy course, but a very enjoyable experience. The professors are awesome people.</comment>This is a great class and you should definitely take it if you are trying to fulfill your science of living systems requirement. The professors are both very engaging and the material is very interesting. The first half of the class is primarily history and the second half is primarily science, which allows for a very broad and well rounded understanding of the theory of evolution.</comment>The professors and teaching staff are phenomenal. Easily the best class to satisfy the SLS requirement.</comment>Andrew Berry is a god among men.  Even if you HATE biology, you should still take this class just by virtue of the fact that Andrew Berry is teaching it.  He's knowledgeable, he's engaging, he's entertaining, he's funny, and he makes you want to learn about evolutionary biology.</comment>This class was great! It was optimal for a person who is not going to go into the sciences but is interested about evolution.  I found that the professors were engaged and passionate and the class pushed me to think critically.</comment>Take for SLS.</comment>Such a painless and fun way to complete the GenEd requirement. I laughed out loud at least once during a class, and the outside readings were painless and most of the time unnecessary. One of the bad things about this class was the final paper in addition to a final exam. However, the paper was actually kind of fun to write, and the exam was pretty reasonable. Highly recommend.</comment>Blimey what an incredible course. The hoi polloi of Harvard just gripe on and on about how terrible their Gen-Eds are, but people in this class just smirk, assured that they have chosen one of the best Gen-Eds out there. Even if you've fulfilled your SLS, at least take the class Pass-Fail. Professors Berry and Browne both present the material in a wonderful, engaging fashion that makes every lecture a treat. Professor Browne is the world-expert in her part of history of science. Whenever I'd look up a concept on Wikipedia during class, Professor Browne would be cited on the bottom. And Professor Berry is simply the most dynamic, engaging, British, censor-less lecturer at Harvard. he creates a fun atmosphere that's still educational.
The first half of the course focuses on history and is very interesting; the last half is more biology-oriented, and might be trivial to a biology-concentrator but is fascinating for everyone else.
This class is a must if you want to fulfill a gen-ed, if you're a senior who wants one last good experience before leaving Harvard, or if you want to be called a "bloody wanker" the first class.</comment>This is an excellent class and I would highly recommend taking it as your SLS. Dr. Browne and Dr. Berry are both fantastic lecturers and work extremely well together. The material is interesting, relevant, and not too difficult. It's a great mix of history of science and evolutionary biology and you'll leave the class feeling like you really learned relevant information. Unlike other classes, section is actually helpful and not boring.</comment>arbitrary grading</comment>Probably one of the best ways to satisfy SLS out there.  This course is an uneasy combination of biology (Dr. Berry) and history of science (Dr. Browne). This uneasy combination manifests itself in a couple of less-than-ideal ways: the instructors interrupt one another, the bio and history of science don't really interact all that much, and some material is given a strange amount of emphasis. 

This course takes a clear stance on a controversial issue: the theory of evolution should be preferred over creationist theories, and the theory of evolution is not incompatible with religion. When dealing with an issue like this, respect and rigor are called for. Unfortunately, the course staff elected to offer neither, preferring to play clips from Family Guy while turning up their nose at those who have creationist beliefs. While their facts and arguments aren't wrong, they certainly don't come off well.</comment>Great solution to the "bio" gen-ed for people who want to learn about more than just science.</comment>This is probably one of the better ways for humanities people to do SLS, but they kind of make life harder in the second half with most of your grade dependent on science even though they spend half the course on history.  Gen eds are always going to be stupid like this and I haven't taken other sls classes, so it's hard to say for sure.  Also, be sure to talk to your tf a lot about the guidance-less final paper and be prepared to do a lot more reading in the second half.  Also don't waste your money buying zimmer because no one cares whether you read it.</comment>This class is not a gem. Its very interesting and not super difficult, but not an easy ride either.</comment>Take the course because of Andrew Berry. If you shop SLS 12 for one class, you'll know what I mean. The workload is incredibly light (only 2 p-sets, each of which is fairly basic). However, I would only recommend this course with reservations because the treatment of evolutionary biology, while wide, might not be as deep as someone with a real interest in biology might like.</comment>If you are a woeful humanities concentrator (as I am), looking for a low-key, fun 'biology' course, take this one. Dr. Berry is exhilarating and the course is not too challenging.</comment>This class is really easy, but only touches on the science -- the focus is on history of science. Still, Andrew Berry is a great lecturer, and makes it entertaining.</comment>Interesting Gen-Ed class</comment>professors are incredible!</comment>Browne and Berry are both fantastic lecturers, and compliment each other in a great way; Berry is hilarious, but Browne is just as engaging in a subtler way, and the combined perspective of History of Science and Evolutionary Biology that they bring is really well balanced and is the perfect way to approach the subject. Reading the Origin for section chapter by chapter was also a great way to tackle that and really enriched the course. Take it! It's a great SLS (something I never thought I would say of that Gen Ed category).</comment>pretty fun, but work gets a little more intense near the end of the semester</comment></course>MUSIC 10hfr: Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra</title>HRO is an amazing community of fantastic musicians. Do it!</comment>It is indeed a large time commitment. Try to find a group of people you can be comfortable around.</comment>HRO is great!</comment>You will learn a lot about orchestral playing, and Fed is a great conductor and will teach you a lot. Also, the group is very friendly and fun.</comment>HRO isn't really about the music anymore, which really saddens me. For the students who love music but chose to go the non-professional route, HRO is supposedly the highest caliber orchestra on the campus, but everyone is too busy worrying about trying to get in the Signet and partying like a fraternity. No one practices the music and at rehearsals everyone, including Fed, seems tired, resigned, and apathetic. They don't even realize what a privilege it is to play music like this. I wish they would value the experience a little more. I hope going on tour to the Philippines and Korea will help give us a purpose to improve our sound and will help us build a stronger community so that we can be more accountable to each other and motivate each other to practice and come on time to rehearsal.</comment>I knew I was going to join HRO even during Visitas. HRO is the highest level orchestral performing group at Harvard. There is a great family of students of all grades, and we try to organize social activities as well as get a great repertoire for concerts. There are many opportunities to get involved with leadership and board positions. Fed is a hilarious and caring conductor.</comment>HRO is a big time commitment and has a few restrictions that may be off-putting to some students, like attendance. HRO's organization will probably change yearly but I found it to be disorganized this year. The community is good, and Fed is a great conductor.</comment>COME AUDITION! IF YOU'RE GOOD WE WANT YOU!</comment>HRO is a serious ensemble that plays difficult orchestral repertoire. Fed is a fantastic conductor and is extremely patient with the orchestra. You must be a serious musician and always be prompt to rehearsal.</comment>I've played in a lot of orchestras on campus, but HRO is easily the most fulfilling group I've played with here.  You get course credit for playing with the best musicians on campus- what else could you want?</comment>Great course for continuing music in college.</comment>HRO is fantastic--if you get a chance to be a part of it, definitely take it!</comment>If you can get in, you should join! HRO's a great community with some great people, and you get to make absolutely sublime music</comment>HRO is love. HRO is life.</comment>HRO is a great orchestra. It's no one's first priority, so sometimes the dedication level wavers a bit, which is too bad, but everyone is a good player and being in the orchestra is an overall positive experience.</comment>It takes a lot of time.  In addition to 5 hours a week of rehearsal there are Saturday retreats.  Your ability to do other kinds of extracurriculars might be limited.</comment>I really enjoy participating in HRO, and I encourage all musicians to audition.</comment>I love Fed and this was a lot of fun but many of its members did not seem to genuinely enjoy the music-making process, and the politics behind HRO seemed a bit weird and uncomfortable. As a freshman, I did not feel very welcomed and just felt aloof throughout the entire semester.</comment>Do HRO! Fed is the best conductor you will ever work with.</comment>HRO is an incredible community that brings together the best classical musicians at Harvard. Join to be challenged, to play your very best, and to enter a wonderful family of musicians. HRO is a fairly large time commitment, but it's absolutely worth it.</comment>Before entering HRO, one should think carefully about the commitment he or she is willing to put into the organization. For many people, this is their main extracurricular activity, which creates a close sense of community, but it's difficult to play in the orchestra when one's priority is in other extracurricular activities.</comment>Audition for HRO!</comment>I came to Harvard because of HRO. I wanted to be able to continue playing seriously while keeping as many career options open as possible. I guess it succeeds, but is plagued by Harvardification by being an inherently political organization.</comment>Most likely, you will end up spending a lot of time in rehearsal, wishing you were somewhere else, and you won't feel like you're part of the orchestra because the people really aren't that close with each other unless you're on the board.</comment>It's perhaps the best orchestra experience you can find at Harvard. However, be warned that it takes a lot of time and commitment.</comment>GET EXCITED FOR TOUR! I'M SO EXCITED!</comment>While this is a time-demanding class, you learn a lot about orchestra-playing and make a lot of good friends!</comment>I absolutely enjoy being a part of the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra. If you get the chance to audition, you should definitely do so.</comment>If you are an incoming musician and worried about not being able to keep up with music, do HRO! It's a blast and the orchestra is really top notch--I assure you that you will be inspired by those with whom you play, and if you're too good to be inspired, come lead and inspire others :)</comment>It's been so far a great experience! I recommend it.</comment>wonderful group, wonderful conductor, great music. intense though, so commitment is necessary</comment>Be aware that HRO is necessarily a large time commitment, and that you should be careful to manage how it fits into the rest of your schedule</comment></course>ENG-SCI 50: Introduction to Electrical Engineering</title>This class is a great intro for Electrical Engineering. The final project is really fun and you get to make something cool. I would recommend for people interested in any engineering field.</comment>As far as SPU goes, this is not your typical "gem" option. That being said, it is probably among the most interesting. Lab is admittedly incredibly frustrating, but this class gave me a real world understanding of so many technologies. The final project is also a really cool opportunity to build something awesome, although beware that it takes a lot of time and the material learned in class doesnt actually fully prepare you. I am glad I took this class because it was always something that I thought I would be interested in. Marko and Chris also love teaching, which is great.</comment>The first half on circuits is the toughest part; if you have some CS background, the last half on digital systems will be pretty easy.</comment>Would recommend to students genuinely interested in hardware. Was a fairly significant amount of work for an elective class. Any background in E&M is beneficial but not necessary.</comment>First thing: Marko and Chris are both great professors who are amazingly invested in the course and the students, and they really looked like they wanted to make it accessible to everyone. That said, there were times where the psets and labs were ambiguous, and were difficult to complete not because they were inherently difficult, but because they were unclear. As someone with a bit of a science and CS background, it was simple enough to follow the topics, but that is despite the fact that they were not taught in the most accessible way. Still, given enough effort, I think most people succeed in it, and it never hurts to learn how to do some basic (yet cool!) EE stuff.</comment>Absolutely amazing. Dont graduate without taking this course</comment>Take this course. It's a lot of fun.</comment>It's not the most rigorous class.</comment>You won't learn how to actually build much until you do the final project</comment>The final project is so much fun! The labs are sometimes frustrating.</comment>ES50 is a great introduction to circuits and electrical engineering. Unless you are genuinely interested in electrical engineering you will probably be tempted to slack off, but even then you will come away with somewhat of a better understanding of how electronics work. I didn't enjoy lecture and thought the course materials (basically the lecture slides) were hard to sift through, but psets and labs help you learn the material.</comment>Fun and easy although more work then i expected</comment>It's a very good introduction to electrical engineering.</comment>This is a great class to fulfill your Gen Ed requirement. The labs can be both frustrating and enjoyable, the homework is relatively easy with ample opportunity for extra credit, and the final project is truly an awesome experience to practically do something in the field that entices you. I felt the course to be very generous when it came to grading, but like I said above, there is often some frustration with a lack of understanding of labs and certain homework problems -- but in the greater (grade) scheme of things, this does not matter.</comment>ES50 tries to cover an ambitious number of topics in a short amount of time. ES50 assumes that you don't know enough about math and physics to really go into depth about a lot of topics, until Chris teaches about transistors in last few lectures. This is great class  if you're interested in any easy, fun way to fulfill the science of the physical universe requirement, but if you want a serious introduction to electrical engineering, I would recommend ES 153 (Physics 123) if you care at all about physics, or ES 52 otherwise. That said, the labs and final project are a lot of fun. Be prepared to spend a lot of time on your final project during reading period!</comment>You have to make it to the end to get the true enjoyment of the course. The final project is the best part.</comment>This is an "easy" class, but you'll still do a fair amount of work.  My favorite and least favorite part of the class was the final project: I really bonded with my group and made friends with a lot of other people in the class during our mutual struggle for hours in the lab during reading period.  Marko was in the lab at 11 on a Saturday night helping us out, and he even brought us doughnuts, which is so awesome of him.  However, the project did take up ALL of my time.  It was a really rewarding experience in the end, and I feel like I got a lot out of it.  If I had the choice, I would definitely take this class again.  Also, fun fact, there are a lot more guys than girls in this class.</comment>I lucked out with having people to do PSETS with who either had some CS or Physics background (that I didn't). But, I'm glad I took it!!</comment>The class is super fun if you're interesting in learning how things work and other electrical stuff... Lectures are fun and really interesting. the Quiz is hard but totally doable if you're on top of practice problems and problem sets.</comment>The project component of the class was the best part. The lectures are kind of bland, and they could be improved with some demonstrations. Lectures are also an hour and a half, which are too long in my opinion for the material covered. Feedback on assignments in the course is not very consistent. The professors care a lot about the students though, and overall it was pretty painless.</comment>A good way to satisfy SPU. It was more work than I anticipated, but worth it. The material is interesting. Most of the Ifs are really engaged with the material and willing to put in a lot of time to help you with whatever you need. The final project is a good experience - it's pretty cool what people can put together. And Professor Loncar is fantastic.</comment>This is a great course! TFs are really helpful and try their best to make you succeed. Marko is an incredible professor and will take a lot of time and energy to help you. Make sure you pay attention in lecture, as some of the material can be tough at first, but nothing is obscenely hard, and the TFs and professors will always be around to help.</comment>Really cool to learn about how everyday stuff works. Lecture is bleh.</comment>Basic knowledge of coding is helpful, especially for final projects.</comment>Fun class! Can be a lot of work and can be VERY disorganized.</comment>ES50 is great mostly because you get to build a ridiculously fun final project in the end. You can survive the course without actually going to lecture but they are really interesting when you do go and you get to build pretty fun things in lab. I think it's a great class to take as an elective if you want to do more hands on things.</comment>You will not believe how much you have learned by the time you finish this class. I am still amazed that I was actually able to think of and build my project.</comment>You do learn a lot about the course - labs are fun, the final project is rewarding, and there isn't that much work compared to other courses. However, there can be a lot of disorganization, lack of help, and confusion sometimes. The class has great potential - it just needs to be more supportive to students (in terms of materials and questions) and organized (duedates, psets, etc). There were definitely times when I got a lot of help, especially after getting closer to TFs, but especially at the beginning as a freshmen, it was tough. Aside from some rough patches though, you learn a lot of electronics and I am consider going into EE after this - so there was definitely some effect.</comment>ES50 is fun and interesting. It is definitely work intensive however. I took the course because I was interested in learning how electronics work and get an intro into building a device through the final project. I'm happy to say that I wasn't disappointed. Despite the long hours in lab, working on psets, and building my final project, I learned a lot and got a taste of engineering. It's a fun SPU and well worth it for those who like science/physics/math. I recommend it!</comment>Until the lab component is fixed and the professors begin to realize much more organization is involved in running a course that's so large, I am unlikely to recommend this course. Formal labs should have ended much earlier to allow us extra time on the final project. Labs are absolutely terrible: long, confusing, and often, dysfunctional.</comment>Very hard but very rewarding. the final project is a lot of fun</comment>The course gives a great introduction to electrical engineering!</comment>If you are even thinking about engineering you should take it!</comment>ES50 is a very practical course; half the things you learn will be like puzzle-solving (op amps, for example), and half the things you learn will seem like either CS50 or a harmonics lesson in physics. Be aware that while there's a lot of guidance for the psets and assignments and usually TFs are amazing during lab, it's sometimes disorganized (for instance, the date of the final project fair changed a couple weeks before the end of the semester, and the nature of the fair was pretty unclear to us until very close to the date). Additionally, you have to really ask for help for the final project if you don't know what you're doing, so that's also difficult. Overall, would take again, but be a lot more proactive (annoying?) in getting help.</comment>If you are interested in the material and want to walk away with some tangible skills while picking up a Gen Ed credit, then this is the class for you. It will require you to put in some effort, but you are able to reap the rewards of your labor. There are bonus points on the psets, labs rarely take the full 3 hours, and you get to do a creative final project! This class was my dream come true. If Marko Loncar teaches this course, then definitely take it in the future.</comment>It was a fun and exciting way to explore concepts. It taught us to apply our knowledge through the labs. It also allowed us to further develop our teamwork skills through the unique and enjoyable final project.</comment>Fun projects, and it's easy to stay on top. Just don't procrastinate.</comment>This course has very interesting labs and the final project is a blast to do. Lectures can be dull and the entire class is a tad disorganized.</comment>Only take this course if you want a fun elective or are considering concentrating in electrical engineering. If you are set on electrical engineering, take a more advanced course.</comment>The project is a lot of work, but it's really a lot of fun!</comment>It is a fun class. Teaches a lot. Don't expect much from the lectures though (unless the format is going to change) or the sections (almost non-existent). But the lab hours are awesome.</comment>This course taught me a great deal about electrical engineering, which is great. However, the lectures are sometimes confusing and many times not applicable to the psets. I feel that I could have learned the material better if the course were taught better. The final project is very cool though!</comment>Take this course if you want to kill a GenEd but also learn something really cool. Everyone should take ES50; the stuff you learn here makes you more of a person, in the same way that reading Shakespeare does. Like with reading Shakespeare, ES50 is something you might not use one day but is such a key part of everyday life that everyone should take it.</comment>"The more you don't know, the more you learn!" Marko often said this, and I think it really was kind of the mantra/theme of the whole course. The teaching team was dedicated and readily available. The professors had a genuine enthusiasm for the material. Overall, the course was a lot of fun, and I learned a lot. Wish more classes at Harvard were run this way. Highly recommend.</comment>If you are at all interested in electrical engineering, I would recommend taking this course. The material is very manageable, the labs are fun, and the final project is very rewarding. The course is somewhat disorganized, but not to the point that it is a real detriment to the course.</comment>If you don't plan on becoming an electrical engineer, do not take this class. It was a headache learning all of the different concepts that were breezed through in lecture. If you have a decent background with small circuits and want to take this course for the gen ed, go for it, otherwise, be prepared to work hard.</comment></course>STAT 392hf: Research Topics in Missing Data, Matching and Causality</title>This is a great opportunity to learn and to receive feedback if you are doing research using the Rubin Causal Framework.</comment></course>EXPOS 10.013: Introduction to Expository Writing</title>Good. Take.</comment>If you are not sure about your writing prowess, let Expos 10 screen you.</comment>It helped ease me into writing at Harvard and gave me the resources necessary to move forward.</comment>It is hugely helpful in preparing for college-level writing.</comment></course>AFRAMER 130x: Richard Wright: Literature, Philosophy, and Politics</title>A wonderful course with two of Harvard's greatest professors. You don't have to (and you won't) love everything by Wright to love this course.</comment>Not only is Wright an amazing writer, but this class really allows you to understand Wright's philosophy and writing style by exposing you to his entire collection of work. Not many other courses at Harvard provide the opportunity to delve so deeply into a single artist's work. After taking this class, you will have a notion of Wright unlike many other readers, acclaimed critics included, who have only encountered some of his creations. That being said, you will be reading at least one piece by Wright every single week, which can get intense, given Wright's strong political opinions and complex thought processes. The professors are also really great. Take advantage!</comment>Another great Af-Am class that looks in-depth at one author. Giving great insight into that persons works and influence</comment></course>CELTIC 118: The Gaelic World: 1100 - 1700</title>This is a great class for looking at Gaelic history, mostly the history of their literary development and learned orders and how all of this was affected by the coming of the Saints, Normans, and English throughout the medieval and early modern history of Ireland and Scotland. Prof. Gillies knows so much about these subjects so learning from him is very beneficial.</comment></course>FRSEMR 30t: The Novel in the Twenty-First Century</title>If you're interested in diving into contemporary fiction this class is a great setting to do so.</comment>Take this class! Timothy Wientzen is an amazing professor and not only very approachable but also super interesting to talk to and very knowledgeable about the material.</comment>If you want an excuse to read some kick-ass novels during a time when you feel like there's no hours in the day for fun reading, take. this. class.</comment>Professor Wientzen is awesome! Take this class if you want to have a chance to read really cool modern novels, talk about relevant current issues, and have it count as schoolwork.</comment>Great class! Pretty easy workload if you enjoy reading. The highlight of the class is group discussion. It's essentially a book club, with a few papers thrown in. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Tim is super nice and brings snacks and facilitates interesting conversations without controlling the flow too much.</comment>This class was a great way to start your freshmen year. It was a relaxed environment and the professor was enthusiatic and engaged without being too demanding. For the most part, this course doesn't require too much time. There is one or two weeks where there is a lot of reading, but if you plan out your week, it will be totally manageable.</comment>This is a really excellent Freshmen Seminar, and I think anyone with even a casual interest in novels should consider taking it. Not only will you read a lot of really good, and, at times, weird novels, but the discussion in class is really engaging and I definitely have a greater appreciation not only for literature, but modern historical challenges like climate change. The work load is not crazy and the reading is very enjoyable.</comment>It's a pretty chill class.</comment>This is such an excellent freshman seminar!! I was expecting to love it, and it exceeded all my hopes. Professor Wientzen is super fun and easy to talk to. He's great at getting discussions going and keeps the topics very interesting. This course genuinely changed my perspective on many issues totally relevant to any freshman and anyone living in this century. If you're like me, you won't even realize how interesting certain ideas are (lack of identity, what it means to be "real", climate change) until they get totally broken down in discussion. The key is to do the readings and take serious interest each meeting. Given the nature of the various subjects we talked about, people came to the table with a great variety of opinions. I always looked forward to this class during the week, and two hours often felt too short. If you are someone who enjoys digging into contemporary novels, I don't see how this class could be anything less than amazing. Take it!</comment>Class discussions are great, although two hours is a long time. Not as ambitious as the course description makes it out to be, but a solid class if you enjoy talking about books.</comment>If you make this class, you are guaranteed to have fun, learn loads and to be writing this exact comment on your turn. Take this class!</comment></course>OEB 10: Foundations of Biological Diversity</title>If you're interested in biodiversity/evolutionary biology, then it's a great class that covers a lot of ground. If not, be aware the the exams require a lot of memorization.</comment>Elena Kramer is a goddess and the TF stuff is very good!!</comment>I honestly did not expect to enjoy this course going in, and it ended up being one of my favorite this semester. OEB has a lot of interesting applications that I hadn't considered before. Just make sure to leave enough time to study for the midterms and final, as they require a lot of memorization. Read the study questions!</comment>It is a terrible course, but oeb as a concentration is worth it.</comment>OEB 10 is a great class. I can honestly recommend this class to anyone, not just OEB concentrators. For that matter, not just to science concentrators: for all of you people out there looking for an SLS, this class is super chill, really interesting, and doesn't require much from you on a week-to-week basis. I'd also recommend doing the Popular Press Opt-in project; I don't know how much it's weighed on my grade yet (obviously), but it was a great way to introduce myself to some really high-quality evolutionary biology writing. Take this class, you won't regret it (unless you for some reason have a strong adversity to plants--those get a lot of attention for a week or two in the middle of the course).</comment>Do the practice problems to study for the exam -- they take the lectures (which can sometimes be confusing) and focus on the important concepts. The grading is weird and section can feel excessive sometimes but the lectures are really interesting and the instructors are really helpful!</comment>Do the study questions</comment>This is a much better option to take than LS1a or LS1b if you are a premed looking to fulfill the biology requirement.  The field trips are a fun addition to the material and this course has great lecturers who manage to give an excellent overview of organismic biology.  However, beware that the difficulty is very misleading.  Since there is very little work, your grade consists of two midterms and a final in addition to the grant proposal.  Try to do the optional lab write-ups, press project, optional grant proposal, but the optional problem sets are extremely hard to get an A on.  Also, the exams are very memorization heavy and it is quite difficult to get an A on the exams.  It seems like they made the course harder this year as opposed to years in the past.  Make sure you like your TF since there were some TFs who lacked knowledge on all subjects in the course.</comment>Memorization is key. Do all the optional material, and study the study questions.</comment>This class is very much taught in an AP Bio style- just as the topics get interesting, the lecturers have to move on to new topics without doing the previous ones justice. In order to best prepare for exams, do all of the Questions posted in each Lecture, and contact Collin if you have any questions. Depending on what TF you get, section may or may not be a waste of time. 

The benefits of this course are that you get to write a grant proposal about a question in science that interests you, and that you get to go on field trips. Other than this, I dont' feel that this course gives one a very good mastery or understanding of any topic except to the extent required on exams.</comment>The material is really fascinating and the lecture practice questions are a key to reviewing the concepts. The professors are very passionate about the material and experienced in the subject matter. The atmosphere is not as tense as other biology class and you really gain an appreciation of biodiversity and its role in our lives afterwards.</comment>There's a lot covered but it's all so interesting. Exams are fair and the only hard part is probably the grant proposal, but it's a very great course.</comment>It's your basic survey course.  I love OEB so I wish I could say otherwise but it really mimicked a lot of the generic premed courses.  If you want to get a sense of what being an OEB major is, don't take this class, take an upper level.</comment>Make sure you understand the lectures after each one. It's hard to have to teach yourself all the lectures come exam time. Don't use the textbook - only use lecture info to study.</comment>This course made me fall in love with biology. It doesn't really teach you a lot of in-depth information, but how to think like a biologist.</comment>The opt-in assignments were great. The grading system is better than fair, and the midterms and final are very straightforward. Section is short with a great review, and the lectures are interesting. Highly recommend!!</comment>you need to review lecture material each week in order to enjoy this class. I think you can enjoy this class if you either a)really like OEB or b) consistently review the material. I did not and was consistently confused each lecture.. and then only really understood the material after reviewing for the midterms. The workload isn't too much but in order to succeed you need to put in many more hours each week than most people do. There are optional assignments to boost your grade but I'm not sure how much they help you. It isn't structured very well. It is a lot of memorization and not easy so if you are looking to fulfill second semester of bio for premed like I was.. I'd suggest taking something else. It was alright though. not very stressful.</comment>Try to do opt in problems because it will help and don't under estimate the midterms. They will trip you up and you can lose dumb points.</comment>Do the extra credit. Study with a group. Be prepared for a lot of memorization. Use Collin and the TFs for help. They are very knowledgable!</comment>This course is definitely worth taking. It covers a large variety of topics, and the professors and TFs really care about the material. It can get a bit dry at times.</comment>It is great and overs a very comprehensive view of organismic biology. However, it can be a lot of information, like most introductory courses, and at times I wish we would've covered a few topics more in-depth instead of a whole bunch. It is very manageable though! Just keep up with the study questions and you will do fine on exams! Also, you only need the book to complete the optional pests.</comment>It's a great straight forward class if you stay on top of your studies.</comment>This class sacrifices meaningful depth for breadth. The idea is to expose you to a range of topics in OEB, but it's really just memorizing lots of shallow detail. The tests were the study questions rearranged.  You learn heaps of interesting facts, but leave without a cohesive body of knowledge. Honestly, just skip this class and go right to a higher level OEB -- it will be worth it and you don't really need this class as a prerequisite. I did it and so can you! OEB is such a fantastic department and this class does not do it justice. That said, you can tell the course staff cares. The professors seem invested and passionate. TF Heather is awesome.</comment>I took this course figuring it would be an easy A. From what they told us in the course, the exams would be fair and grades would also be fair. On the contrary, I found that studying the material that they told us to was not enough to do well on exams, and the opt-in assignments were a waste of time. Take this course, but be aware that it is not as easy as you think.</comment>This course tries to cover too much material and do too many things  at once for students interested in life science. It failed to be cohesive because of that - section and lecture and field trips always felt scattered.</comment>take if premed or bio major, or if you are really interested in topic.  not ideal for random elective</comment>OEB 10 is an interesting class and doesn't have an overwhelming amount of work, and the opt in assignments are really helpful. Collin is a wonderful human.</comment>The course is fine if you need a way to fulfill an OEB or pre-med requirement, but independently of that, it has issues.  Professors are great but the way their lectures were strung together was oftentimes very unclear, and they go through a ton of material very quickly.  Labs are tedious and riddled with review that is helpful but mandatory where it could otherwise be left to be done at your discretion.  The course will give you a solid grounding in biodiversity and you will meet some great professors, but those are the only major positives.</comment>Pretty easy but there are so many more interesting/intense courses you could be taking on ANY of these topics. Good survey of life. AWESOME field trips.</comment>This class is such a chill and enjoyable class that I would take it to learn some general evolutionary concepts (that aren't too conceptually difficult) with a fairly light workload if you choose to make it so. The TF's and Professors are all laidback people who still care about the subject, but due to the nature of the subject (especially phylogeny), it's fairly heavy on memorization.

That being said, definitely do and know the lecture review things that Collin posts thoroughly. He's awesome and writes the exams as well (though I'm not sure if he'll be back next year?), and they're really good for knowing what material you're asked to study.</comment>Take advantage of office hours and get to know Collin.</comment>It's a cool class to learn stuff but the way they run it and grade it make it difficult to enjoy.</comment>All memorization, honestly. The field trips are fun!</comment>Not the absolutely easiest way to satisfy SLS, but not hard, and very interesting.</comment>too broad, i did not enjoy this at all</comment>This class is great, but more work than you would expect. The fact that they rotate four teachers gets frustrating, but rely on our section leader for consistency. Definitely put in the time to do the extra credit, and definitely go on as many field trips as possible.</comment>Take this class with caution. The tests are hard to do well since they cover quite a multitude of topics and areas.</comment>chill class but you wont learn anything new if you have a bio background</comment>The only good part of OEB 10 was the optional problem sets. You can get through this course doing basically nothing but going to lecture for most of the semester and just cramming for a few days before the exams. That said, the material is pretty basic, and will be mostly review if you have had a good AP biology class. A lot of emphasis is put on memorization, and grades don't seem to be correlated with conceptual understanding of the material. The field trips for this class almost made it worth it on their own though, and a lot of the examples in lecture were pretty cool.</comment>It's a lot of memorization, so start studying for the midterms early. It's also a much better class if you do the opt-in assignments and go on the field trips. Sustaining Life is an excellent book to pick for the Popular Press project. It really ties together everything you learned in class and makes it significant.</comment>Overall the class is interesting but covers many topics (bacteria, plants, fungi) that not all students will have a personal interest in. It also requires a lot of memorization. However, I left feeling like I had a much greater understanding of the diversity of life.</comment>If the idea of learning (at least 3 times) about gigantic undersea worms that never eat, don't have anuses, live in pitch blackness at the bottom of the ocean near volcanic vents, and get their food from sulfur-eating bacteria that live in a specialized organ in their bodies sounds good to you, you'll love this class. I did.</comment>This course covers a lot of information very quickly, so be prepared to memorize a lot of information before the midterms and final exams.</comment>If you're taking the class for OEB requirement, chances are comments won't sway you much either way. Nevertheless, I would say that, if you can digest it, this class will leave you with some of the most fascinating encyclopedic knowledge you can find in a course here. Though the class can be disorganized and difficult to understand in terms of expectations, I would nonetheless recommend it—if you can bear it, it's definitely worth it.</comment>The class is a great intro to Biology, as it teaches about biodiversity, molecular biology, and ecology. However, the class was based mostly on memorization, and originality and authenticity was not valued much (1-2 assignments on grant proposals). Overall, the class does not require much work outside of class. Focus on memorizing the slides and lecture questions.</comment>This course has a lot of issues. Unfortunately, it's a prereq for a lot of other good classes, so it has to be suffered through. It's disorganized, sprawling, etc. and it makes it hard to learn.</comment>This is a pretty easy course that gives a good overview of biology, letting you figure out what portions of biology you enjoy the most.  Very much a survey course, but that isn't a bad thing.</comment>This is a fantastic course. If you're interested in the diversity of life, this is the course for you. As far as pre-med goes, it's an easy way to get out your second bio (the lab portion of this class is TINY), but not applicable to the MCAT. Overall, a solid course that I would recommend even to non-science concentrators who are looking for an interesting SLS course.</comment>OEB 10 makes you feel like you know everything about biology. It covers a nice balance of topics from metabolism, to categorization of all the life on earth, to current issues facing life with climate change, so there is something for everyone. It also allows you to learn a great deal without doing a great deal of work.</comment>Oh my god it's so easy. This is a ridiculous course. It's also weird and hilarious and fun. The slides don't make sense sometimes--there's one that's just a picture of coral, and then in comic sans in the corner it says "soft coral porn" which, as someone who didn't go to lecture and thus had no explanation, was pretty great. This class is great. I don't even want that magical slide explained to me.</comment>This is one of the most amazing classes offered at Harvard. The course offers so many different and interesting topics that will enable you to gain a greater understanding of the world around you and how we as humans are part of an interdependent ecosystem. It is exciting to understand the basis of current environmental concerns.  You will also love gaining a deep knowledge about the most fascinating things (such as organisms that use iron for fuel, or how the largest organism on earth is a fungus.) Every class was eye-opening!</comment>The material in this class is fascinating and extremely relevant - you'll learn a lot of information that will apply to modern conservation efforts and global-scale biology. The lectures are not very well organized, so studying is a challenge in terms of knowing WHAT to study, not the material itself. If you have taken AP Biology and LS1a/LPSA and LS1b before, you are totally golden, but it's definitely manageable if you have only taken AP Bio. The field trips are a BLAST, it's so worth it to get off campus and explore New England from a biologist's perspective. Also, definitely do the opt-in assignments, they're basically a Harvard form of extra credit.</comment>Lectures move quickly. Even though the course material is fascinating, lectures were difficult to pay attention to. That being said, this is not the worst way to fulfill pre-med biology. The field trips are awesome, and the TFs are great.</comment>You should take this class, but be prepared for the 2nd midterm to memorize phylogenies extensively.  It is unlike anything else in the course with the amount of detail that it entails</comment>I took this initially thinking I wanted to concentrate in OEB, but I changed my mind. It counts as a pre-med requirement, so it worked out fine. If it wasn't a concentration or premed requirement, I probably would not have taken it. It's a fairly easy class, though. Just study the study questions and you'll be fine. After the second midterm, I stopped attending lecture. Looking back, I probably could have skipped all of the lectures and focused on the study questions. Also, memorize that phylogenetic tree thing. It's on the second midterm and final. Seahorses are fish. This will make sense when you take the course. Labs are fun.</comment>This class is for anyone interested in biology, but is not sure about what specific field to pursue.</comment>This was an awesome course! The professors do a great job of making the material interesting and tying it to relevant examples. The field trips were awesome and lab wasn't actually a waste of time. They really want you to have a good experience and try hard to give you a taste of being a field biologist. Definitely the most caring and helpful course staff I've ever had. Exams are a bit of a pain because there is so much material but it's definitely do-able- just use the study questions for each lecture.</comment>I took this for premed credit, and I would only recommend this for premed credit, if you are an OEB concentrator, or if you are willing to dedicate A LOT of time to pursue your passion in these subjects. This course is a lot of time, a lot of memorization, and the grading is really tough. The final is 40 percent, and having taken it, I can say it is quite ambiguous. I am definitely anxious about how the course turned out for me even though I made a strong effort to keep up with the material and assignments throughout the semester. These two things seem at odds to me, so I hope in the future more guidance can be given on how to focus studying in this course and about how you will be evaluated. Overall, I am happy I took this course, but definitely think about why you are taking it before you make the decision to commit to it.</comment>This class was pretty decent overall. It isn't a particularly hard class but large quantities of information were covered, so expect a lot of  memorization (though some of it is a repeat from LS 1b). Lectures vary widely in quality and they're all videotaped, so it's not really necessary to go to all of them. I find the material to be inherently interesting, but the way it was presented can be kind of disjointed sometimes. The textbook is not necessary at all and all you need to do to prepare for exams is know that answers to the study questions they give you. I did enjoy the field trip to the Boston Harbor Islands and section was pretty relaxed. I would say take it if you're interested and are thinking of concentrating in OEB, but otherwise, probably skip it.</comment>If you're interested in getting an overview of different topics in biology, this is a great course to take. At times though, the class felt a disjointed because it seemed like it was trying to cover too much. It was frustrating sometimes because I felt like we were just skimming over some really interesting topics. Really would have benefitted with some more depth.</comment></course>MOD-HEB B: Elementary Modern Hebrew</title>Absolutely hands-down the best language class taught at Harvard. Irit is a gem and an amazing teacher and person. You will feel loved, you will learn SO much, and you will have a great time doing it.</comment>This class is incredible! It is honestly one of the best classes I have ever taken at Harvard. I've been able to read/write in Hebrew for years, but I've always wanted to be able to speak and understand it. This class is perfect for that. I really feel like I'm learning so much and like I can actually hold a conversation, even after just one semester. Irit makes this class so special. She is so encouraging and has a fantastic teaching style—she really cares about all of us and making sure that we all learn. This class has a pretty familial atmosphere, which especially in the usual stress of Harvard is really wonderful. The workload is also quite minimal, with less than half an hour of work on most nights. The weekly quizzes might seem a bit daunting, but I found them to be really helpful in forcing us to stay on top of the material. I honestly can't recommend this class enough. If you are remotely interested in studying Hebrew, take this class!!</comment>You learn so much in this course. It's really incredible. I came in with no prior knowledge whatsoever I cannot begin to describe just how much I've learned about Hebrew, its origins, and the culture of those who speak it.</comment>This is a great class. You learn a lot of Hebrew very quickly in a relatively enjoyable environment. That said, it is a very difficult class because of the pace (you'll have about 60 vocab words to learn each week), the workload, and how different Hebrew is from English, so be prepared to work hard.</comment>I have taken many language classes and taught language myself, and this class was the best one I've ever taken, the most engaging.</comment>If you’re interested in the language, I highly recommend this class. I had been wanting to learn Hebrew for years, and I had to decide between continuing my Spanish education or starting new with Hebrew. I think I made the right call. The class forms a little community. Everyone who takes it wants to be there—people may take it to fulfill the language requirement but it’s not a class people take to “get through.” Irit is so lovely and fun. She wrote the course material, so she knows it really well and the curriculum flows really well. You don’t need prior Hebrew to take the class, but know that if you’re unfamiliar with the alphabet and reading Hebrew you will need to put in lots of hours the first few weeks (some kids enter the class with a basic knowledge of the alphabet and how to read). The class is fast paced, so don’t get behind. Stay on top of vocab and review throughout the semester. Love this class. Highly recommended.</comment>A great course. Whether you're a Jew looking to better understand your identity and/or place in the world, a budding linguist, a Middle East enthusiast, or anything in between, you'll get good, high quality instruction from a very smart, very kind lady.</comment></course>ARABIC A: Elementary Arabic</title>That it's getting harder and they should consider carefully whether they want to commit for a full year of homework everyday and mostly - waking up to class in the early morning eveyday</comment>If you want to learn Arabic, this is an excellent class because you will learn a lot! Don't be too scared off by the workload if you think that Arabic is something you're interested in, but at the same time definitely expect there to be a large workload going into the class. You will need to practice a lot on your own to really learn the material (you will be spending a minimum of 2-3 hours every day studying plus another hour of class time 5 days a week). Additionally, know that there is a significant learning curve at the beginning of the class so be prepared to put in extra effort the first month or so as you learn the alphabet. All that being said, this class is very rewarding when you see how much you've learned at the end of the semester.</comment>Pretty challenging, but pretty rewarding. Great class overall; at the end of the semester you'll come away with a solid grasp of elementary Arabic. The teaching staff do a great job of making sure that you are keeping up with the lessons; make sure to go to office hours!</comment>Do not come in without a passion to learn Arabic. You must be invested and be willing to put a lot of time in for this class. Also it is a full year course so be careful when choosing because you will be locked in.</comment>This Arabic class is very fast paced and will teach you the language much faster than any program out there. After only half a semester, I find my self able to be able to draw basic understanding from Arabic conversations and classical texts. If you have an interest in understanding and or speaking Arabic, take this class. The TF and professor are absolutely ballin'. There is about an hour of homework every day but once you get into the rhythm of it, it's not that bad.</comment>It's an amazing class, but be forewarned; it does not teach you to speak Arabic! Only reading and writing.</comment>The course requires a lot of time and energy, but the rigorous pace of the course means that you will learn more than you thought possible in a short period of time. The instructor is also terrific and knows how to teach for beginners.</comment>Be warned: if you do not have previous experience with Arabic (or a similar language, such as Hebrew), you will find this difficult. This is not for those of you looking to fulfill you language requirement. And one year of this will not leave you in any state to communicate with a native speaker. That said, Arabic is a beautiful language and I have enjoyed the challenge. If you're considering taking it, I think that speaks for itself. If you're on the fence, consider how much time you're willing to dedicate to it. The class itself is five days a week, with homework every night, and the language itself will take you years to get. Personally, I loved the class, it's just not something that you can take lightly.</comment>This course is demanding in difficult. I would only take it if you are genuinely interested in learning the language and are ready to make the commitment.</comment>Be ready to work, but also to have a lot of fun. Fears about the language are often overblown, and with Dalia and Lispeth you will get all the help you need. I definitely was fortunate enough to have two of the best teachers in the department. If you want to stand out to employers, participate in the global economy, and/or want to learn a really exciting language, take Arabic.</comment>This is a very difficult class, but if you can do it you'll be so glad you did.</comment>This is a great course which quickly teaches the ropes of the language and sets you up for further study. Highly recommended.</comment>It's a very challenging, but very rewarding language class. Be prepared to put in a significant amount of work. The teaching staff is excellent. You'll learn a lot in a short amount of time.</comment>It is a great class. Do not be intimidated! The teaching staff is very helpful and you learn a very important skill.</comment>It is important that you don't just do the bare minimum to get by. Studying for the test won't help you learn the language.</comment>This is an amazing, and very difficult class. Lispeth is an *amazing* TF and if you get her, know that she will go the extra mile to make sure that you understand the material and do well. Dalia is such a sweet person, and a great person to learn arabic from.</comment>It's definitely difficult. Arabic isn't easy to learn. However, the instructors work with you personally and make sure you are actually learning. Yeah, it's difficult, but it's so rewarding. At the beginning of the year I couldn't even pronounce a letter and now, after a few months, I can actually have conversations and understand the language!</comment>The class was a lot of fun and very rewarding.</comment>It's tough, and if you're going to take it you need to be really enthusiastic about the language. The first few weeks are killer, but don't give up - once you get the hang of the language, it comes easier, even if you still have to work for it. The class builds a really great sense of community, too.</comment>This course is definitely one of the best courses I have ever taken. It succeeds in teaching the students an extensive amount of material in a very brief time. I shopped all sections for this course, and I must say that professor Dalia's teaching enthusiasm really separates her from others. She is so sincere and understanding towards her students. She is always seeking for ways to make learning a language that is as difficult as Arabic fun. Her energy combined with our TF Lisbeth's organization skills renders learning the language much easier than it would be otherwise. As a non-native speaker, Lisbeth is successful at understanding any confusions and difficulties that new learners may face. She presents the Arabic grammar through charts and study sheets that she prepares to facilitate learning. Also the review sessions that she holds before the exams are always very fun and helpful.</comment>It adds up. You need to stay on top of it otherwise you fall behind.</comment>Be prepared for a very intensive course. Know that you will not be prepared to speak so much as you will be strongly prepared to read and write in formal settings.</comment>Arabic is a really fun language. Please don't just take it because you want to go into business or study the Arab Spring. There is so much depth and nuance. One of the most beautiful languages out there!</comment>This class is difficult, and you will have to devote a significant amount of time to in in order to do well. As is true with any course, really think about how it will fit in to your schedule.</comment>This course is challenging, but your performance is directly linked to how much work you put into the class. If you complete the homework, attend class, and engage with the material, you will do very well.</comment>Depends on dat tf doe</comment>College is the best time to learn another language well</comment>Great class but quite intense</comment>Be ready to work, but it is very rewarding, and you will learn so much!</comment>Arabic is very cool, a challenge, but truly a language I appreciate.</comment>Very very fast paced class, do not fall behind because it will snowball until you feel completely lost, stay on top of your stuff and do all the homework and you should be fine</comment>Professor Dalia and Lispeth are both excellent instructors. I thoroughly enjoyed learning Arabic in this class.</comment>it will be very rewarding but very demanding</comment>This is an amazing class and Sami is a really great teacher. Definitely take this class if you're interested in learning Arabic and are prepared to put in the work.</comment></course>PSY 1502: Cultural Psychology: Exploring Social Identities in the U.S. and Beyond</title>This is the best class ever! Sasha is so knowledgeable about what she teaches, and the material is incredibly eye-opening for both psychology and non-psychology concentrators alike. If you need a cool elective or a psych advanced class, this is it! Reasonable work and really insightful section discussions. Plus, Sasha is just an incredible person.</comment>I would highly recommend this class to any student at Harvard, regardless of concentration. It has a very diverse classroom, and provides an opportunity to learn so much about others and the world around us without being too high on quantity of work or difficulty.</comment>It is a new field so there is only so much to be learned in terms of psychology and academia. However, in terms of learning about people, their differences, and how to be a more thoughtful, accepting individual I would certainly suggest this course. Also relatively low workload.</comment>Cultural psych with Sasha is amazing! It will open your eyes to the way peoples' backgrounds and cultures influence their cognition, neural activity, behaviors, etc. This is definitely one of the most valuable classes I've taken at Harvard, and I think it's one that will actually have lasting impacts on the way I think and interact with other people. The work load is super doable, the exams can be kind of tricky because they're not terribly straight forward, but everything is manageable.</comment>Take this course if you want an interesting psychology class with a great professor and TF. The course is manageable as long as you do all your work and put effort into it. Overall, I would say the class is very fair in terms of its grading. Professor Kimel and Rachel want to work the students and help them. In order to do well, I would say, don't slack off on the culture blogs as they do add up, study the lectures for the exams, and focus on the group project.</comment>Sasha is very interesting and gives great lectures</comment>Real life application of materials, and generally interesting lectures. Section really great, and it is a part of the course (an added half hour at the end of lecture) which means you have an accountability mechanism that promotes actually going to lecture.  Prof. Kimel was receptive of criticisms and open to suggestions throughout the course and frequently offered ways through which students could voice concerns; unlike many other courses at Harvard, she and Rachel actually worked to solve the issues students raised. Midterm and final were difficult and weekly responses required time, but overall very manageable course load. Plus I found some of the material so interesting that I brought it up in conversations with my blockmates.</comment>Great class! Section discussions are the best part as you learn about others cultures. Could potentially be best as a seminar</comment>The Q scores from the last time this was taught were straight 5s. However, there were only five students in the class, so I imagine there was much more of a bond, and the lecture component also felt like section. This time around, there were about 25 people in the class, and it was harder to have that tight-knit section feel. The course is unlike a lot of psych courses in that you aren't taught facts, you are asked to help consider ways to make everyone feel equal, which at times felt very "love each other." It appealed more to my emotional side than my intellectual side.</comment>This class is interesting, but honestly I don't feel like I learned as much as I hoped I would. The field of cultural psychology is dominated by two researchers, so you'll read a lot of their papers but not really much else from anyone else. Some of the grading criteria (for blogs and the project) are oddly particular. It's not a bad class, but not the best either.</comment>The content combined with the sensitive, open-minded way it was presented definitely made this class one of the better (and most important) courses I've taken here. If you put a lot into this class, you'll get a lot out of it. Dr. Kimel is the nicest.</comment></course>MCB 176: Biochemistry of Membranes</title>Interesting class investigating the physical basis underlying membranes and membrane-associated biomolecules.</comment>It is a difficult course but the instructor is great. He is very accessible and has great stories so make sure you take advantage of this and talk to him after class.</comment>Take this class! Some of the concepts are hard but the skills you learn for reading scientific articles, proposing experiments, and writing are hard to beat. If you take the time to really think about the material and engage with Guido and your TF, you will be in for a real treat.</comment>This course is amazing. Professor Guidotti is passionate, excited, and active in his teaching, which is the centerpiece of the course.   Let us be clear, you are taking this course to spend time with Guido, and you will not regret it.   Now, when we speak of teaching, you must not think of this course like any other life science course you have taken. You will not be force-fed facts or a curriculum of "classical knowledge". Instead, Guido will take you to the cutting edge of the field of membrane protein structure and function, and he will guide you in thinking about how to advance it. He will tell you the stories of how things were discovered, not for historical reasons, but so that you can join the intellectual conversation and ask interesting questions.   Every paper you read for the class was written in the last 4 years. Most of the questions you will ask will be answered with "well, your guess is as good as mine," and you will enjoy it. Guido does not ask for much work at all; just read and think about the papers, 1 or 2 per week.   It's worth mentioning that this course involves a great deal of protein structure, despite claiming to be about membranes. It's really about the biophysics of proteins in membranes. You don't need to have taken MCB 65, but it will make thinking about the proteins more natural for you.</comment></course>SPANSH 254: Imagining Caribbean Communities: Border, Nations, and Diaspora in Contemporary Hispanic Caribbean Literatures</title>One of the best courses I have taken at Harvard. The course provides important coverage of canonical works and critical theory, which makes the study of lesser-known artists even more accessible (as we have a context to contrast their work, or place them in dialogue, with). Prof. García-Peña asks interesting and complex questions (both overarching for the course and to guide study of specific texts). She is attentive to students' interest, engagement with the texts, and previous knowledge (supplementing where she feels necessary). She has high expectations of her students, but in such a way that encourages excellence and development; it was a real pleasure to work with her, and I'll jump at the opportunity to take another of her classes. For the combination of interesting subject matter and an excellent instructor, I recommend the course heartily.</comment></course>MATH 131: Topology I: Topological Spaces and the Fundamental Group</title>Emily lectures very well and the assignments are useful for learning the material.</comment>Topology is really cool and a little different than other fields of maths. It's definitely worth checking out.</comment>This course is a very useful introduction to topology, and Professor Riehl is a very good lecturer who will make sure that the class is understanding the material with periodic sanity checks. If you keep up with the material, this class will be very good.</comment>Emily Riehl is a very good instructor and makes the material fun and interesting.</comment>Emily is awesome, and the material is very interesting.</comment>Not too much work, fun material, well taught by Emily</comment>This is a really cool course. Topology is fun: visual and mind-blowing, especially algebraic topology towards the end. As usual, the professor is most important, and that's a large part of the reason why this was such a great course. In any case, though, the textbook is nice so whoever teaches it next year, shop it!</comment>homeworks r hard, exams are t/f justification and not that bad, emily is kool</comment>Topology I is very fun. The concept is not hard to understand. The objects you'll see in the class are nice.</comment>great material great prof</comment>If Emily's teaching this class, take it. With Emily, this was the most painless math class I've taken at Harvard. This is one of these classes whose material you need to know if you're doing any kind of math, so unless you've already seen this stuff before you'll probably need to take it. It's pretty standard stuff, the material is not difficult to process and fun to work with. Just do it!</comment>My favorite math class I have taken at Harvard.  Emily is an amazing lecturer, and the psets, while difficult, are very instructive.  She makes a very difficult topic accessible.  Highly recommended to anyone with an interest in proof-based math.</comment>Good class overall. Emily's style of "picture proofs" or even live demos (how often have you ever seen a live demo in a math class!) really help solidify the concepts.</comment>Super interesting material and really well-structured tests. Not a super intense class but you learn s bunch. Emily is one of the better lecturers I've had in the department, too.</comment>Emily is an incredible lecturer. I have never had an instructor in math that was simultaneous so approachable, comprehensible, and enthusiastic about teaching. I really didn't think that topology would be a branch of math I would care about so much until after taking this course. It has definitely been one of my favorites in the math department.</comment>This course is not easy, but is very rewarding. Definitely keep up with the material each week! There are a lot of good resources for point-set topology online, including lecture notes from other courses, that can be helpful if you're struggling with a particular topic.</comment></course>PSY 3555: Instructional Styles in Psychology</title>This course can be helpful for teaching your sections, though the quality of feedback and ability for you to improve will likely depend on who is teaching/TFing the course. Ours was very helpful!</comment>Give a lot of feedback to your peers! It will help improve your TFing, also.</comment></course>OEB 220r: Writing fellowship and grant proposals for the biological sciences</title>This course will help the grant you're writing and your writing in general immensely.</comment>If you are interested in pursuing a career in scientific research or are starting graduate school, this course will help you learn the fundamentals of writing a research grant and can be submitted at the end of the semester. Often students receive grants after taking this course!</comment>Those of us in OEB are required to apply for a fellowship in our first year. Taking this class ensures that you start thinking about the application early and have plenty of time to get organized. You learn specific tips for the GRFP, read a number of previous applications, and have your essays critiqued by the class every week. It definitely made my application stronger than if I had written it on my own.</comment></course>EXPOS 10.012: Introduction to Expository Writing</title>great for experience</comment>Tad Davies is the best.</comment>Take it! Extremely helpful class, not alot of work but alot of substance.</comment>You will most definitely feel prepared for Expos 20! Take in all the advice your professor has to say.</comment>If you are even the slightest hesitant about your writing skills, definitely enroll in this course. This course really builds your confidence when writing. It is a good relaxed course to help either enhance your writing or to show you how to write as a whole.</comment></course>UKRA Br: Intermediate Ukrainian</title>This is the best way to learn Ukrainian! (especially with specific literary texts in mind, which in my case are necessary for dissertation research)</comment></course>MUSIC 150a: Theory IIa</title>You have to take this class as a prerequisite for many other classes, so take it. However, don't expect anything really fun or mindblowing.</comment>At least with Andy teaching it you just go over examples in class and a general structures of different forms. Also a lot of confusing conversations. Andy is great as a teacher in every other way though in that he cares and you can tell. But still. Definitely do not take unless you have to, and in that case I'll say that it's just an overview of classical music forms and you'll learn some words that make you sound like an informed classical musician that don't really apply to the actual experience of listening to music (even classical) a lot of the time. It's confusing and not horrible but annoying and just sad in comparison to Prof. Beaudoin's awesome theory courses (51a, 51b, and so I've heard, 150b)!</comment>This class, with Andy, Dan, and Frederick teaching, was absolutely reasonable in terms of workload, and well-designed in terms of assignments, keyboard assignments, etc. The teaching staff were so absolutely dedicated and enthusiastic; I was so grateful to have taken it with these teachers, all with their own unique perspective on classical style and form.</comment>This strong recommendation is largely based on the enthusiasm and effort of this year's teaching staff.</comment>This class isn't truly that difficult, but with all of its components, it easily takes up as much time as an intensive language course that would count as two credits. You need to be willing to take the time and put in the work if you're going to be satisfied with your final project, which is the culmination of the semester. I would recommend meeting with your TF or professor outside of class, just to hear what they have to say – it's a great way to get critiqued on your work, even if you think you're doing a good job.</comment>Rewarding in the end, even though it has its slow patches. Prepare to do a lot of model composition.</comment>Take the course if you are serious about learning the material and think it would help with your musicianship. Otherwise, expect the 2 hour lectures to be quite dry and for it to not directly help unless you put a lot of thought into it.</comment>As somewhat of an academic renegade who seeks to decentralize the western classical tradition in my own curriculum, this course rubbed against me in many ways. I guess I'm a little skeptical of the importance of sonata form (especially only in the form of string quartets and keyboard music) in that it takes up a whole course. Alas, it's required of me and it was rewarding in several respects. Definitely a good space for the theory buffs.</comment>come curious and ready to learn. Andy is a great professor and wants to base the class of the students</comment>You will get from this what you put into it. Don't be afraid to ask questions.</comment>I loved this class, definitely one of the best classes I've taken at Harvard. Lectures and sections were really fun and informative, and the work was enjoyable. It was really cool to go in depth in a particular style, and writing our final sonata composition felt like quite an achievement. Andy and the TFs are wonderful, and really make the experience in this class a fantastic one.</comment>The class was great with Andy. Unfortunately, he'll never teach it again, so I can't say what the course will be like in future years. Anyway, most people who take this course are required to take it for their concentration, so what I say here will likely have no impact on whether or not people enroll.</comment>Only take this class if (1) you have to satisfy your music concentration requirements or (2) you are deeply interested in analyzing the piano and string quartet sonatas of Beethoven, Mozart, and Haydn. This course is not a comprehensive survey course on the Classical style as suggested in the course description.</comment>It's awesome! Despite its specificity (focus on the sonata), you'll learn more than you think you will and will appreciate it.</comment>Take this course if you would like a deeper understanding of Classical music. But be careful, this course is very difficult and much more knowledge than you think is required.</comment>There's a great sense of continuity from 51a/51b into 150a. It's a chance to take all the details of harmonic analysis and apply them in figuring out a piece in a more general sense. Be prepared in taking a hit to your grades, though, because it's easy to lose points on assignments in this class.</comment></course>ENGLISH Ckr: Introduction to Playwriting: Workshop</title>This was hands-down my favorite course this semester. You will be challenged to produce quality work, but it's a very fun challenge to rise to.</comment>If you've ever wanted to learn about what thought process (or lack thereof) goes into writing a play, or want an opportunity to improve your craft, definitely consider this class!</comment>Harvard creative writing is phenomenal, and Intro Playwriting is not an exception. Sam Marks is one of the most useful people to have criticizing your work, especially at the early stages. Being able to write so much creative work for one class and get consistently solid feedback is absolutely amazing. Everyone should talk at least one creative writing course at Harvard. Everyone.</comment>In no other class at Harvard are you encouraged to go nuts and write a play, whatever it may be. It's rather exciting.</comment>This is the best class I have ever taken.</comment>If you have ever wanted to write a play or see what the Creative Writing department is like, this is a great class that will give you a positive experience of both. Also, contrary to popular knowledge, nothing is off limits when you're writing a play.</comment>This is a great class. If you've ever been interested in theater and wanted to try creative writing or if you were just interested in creative writing and wanted to try something new this is a great way to get a introduction to that area of english.</comment>This class is amazing!!! But really. You really get to explore your own writing style, and the class is much more about helping you develop yourself as a writer rather than teaching you how to write a play. That may sound bad, given that the class is called "playwriting", but if there's one thing I've learned, it's that writing is a very individual process, with no hard and steady rules. And this class really emphasized that personal development, which is great!</comment>Good class, but I would have liked to be pushed more. Great readings, and Sam is great about being concrete and specific about techniques that accomplish things on stage.</comment>This class was my favorite by far of the entire semester. Though I had had playwriting experience before enrolling in English Ckr, I grew significantly as a playwright. At the end of this course, you will have written an entire one-act play, and that is an incredible accomplishment.</comment></course>CHNSE 166r: Chinese in Humanities</title>This is an incredible incredible class if you are looking to learn about Chinese literature. The class is incredibly well-done for students who want to get a basic understanding of the Chinese literary cannon. A great great course on this end.  However, if you are looking/mainly interested in the language portion of the course, I would not necessarily recommend the class. There is an opportunity to improve your reading; however, this is not the main objective of the course.</comment>This course will introduce you extensively to modern Chinese literary traditions. Beware of the intensive pace, however, and the relative shallowness of your understanding of the material.</comment>This was by far the best Chinese class I took at Harvard! It's refreshing to use your Chinese to discuss literature instead of learning new sentence structures every semester. The teacher to student ratio is insane (3 professors for 5 students), both professors were very engaging and super engaged in the course (they organized a conference with Professor Wang's PhD students) and the readings we did were great literature. I really felt like I learned a lot and improved my Chinese. It's a very challenging class, especially if you're fresh out of 140 - be ready for a big time investment. If you're interested in Chinese culture and want a break from the other Chinese language classes, I highly recommend it!</comment>This is an amazing class for anyone interested in challenging themselves to further improve their Chinese, without the rote structure of a traditional language class. Students have the opportunity to engage with a wide selection of modern Chinese literary works, as well as to spend the semester working on an in-depth independent research paper on a topic of their choosing. From focusing on mastering the material, you will undoubtedly find your language skills (especially when it comes to writing and expressing your ideas) naturally improving as well.</comment></course>MBB 980f: Creativity Research: Madmen, Geniuses, and Harvard Students</title>This class is an absolute gem. It is fascinating and low-key, but every assignment is interesting. You get to choose any creative luminary you want to study for the whole semester, so you have a huge amount of say in what you are writing about and studying. Professor Carson is great. The material is incredibly relevant to daily lives, and all super super interesting. If you are looking for a class that is low-key, but (more importantly) absolutely fascinating, this class is by far the best option. I loved it.</comment>Take this class! The workload is extremely manageable and the creative luminary project was really fun! Definitely start the term paper in advance because 15 pages will be brutal if left to the last minute.</comment>Creativity is a fascinating topic and one that demands teaching by an expert like Shelley. Class discussions are fun and it is a wonderful learning environment.</comment>This class is interesting, laid-back, and very enjoyable. Take it if the topic interests you.</comment>This course is amazing. I looked forward to participating in section each week, and Shelley does an excellent job of creating a positive space for students to share their opinions about course material. I honestly looked forward to reading and writing about my creative luminary, and it was really interesting to hear about others' luminaries in class in comparison to my own. The final paper was a bit daunting, but Shelley offered excellent support to get through it, and I was very proud of my final paper. The only thing that I did not like was the lack of feedback on assignments. I did not receive all of my grades on my writing assignments and also never received my presentation score. Sitting here the day after finals have ended, I also have not received my final paper. While this should not deter someone from taking the course, it is something to consider if this kind of thing gives you anxiety.</comment></course>GOV 94xy: Migration and Politics in the Era of Globalization</title>This is a wonderful class, I'd recommend it to anyone even remotely interested in migration. Ruxy is wonderful, really cares about her students, and gives very useful feedback on assignments and presentations. Section discussions are very interesting and varied. Plus, we had guest speaker series that brought in outside perspectives on migration. This is one of the best Government classes I have taken and a great way to fulfill a Gov 94 requirement because you get a lot of feedback on your work and are actually able to work on your final paper throughout the semester.</comment>This class will teach you many theories about why people migrate and will allow you to look at the flipside of migration, from receiving to sending countries, from national governments, supranational actors, etc.</comment>Ruxy is amazing! You can tell she loves what she's doing and the subject matter that we're discussing, which makes the class very enjoyable!</comment>Find a different seminar</comment>This course does an excellent job of introducing you to issues of migration. Factors shaping policy, forces driving migration, and changing conceptions of the migrant and the nation are all considered. After a thorough treatment of the topic, you get the opportunity to write a research paper under the eminent guidance of Dr. Paul, a bright scholar.</comment>Take this course if you are at all interested in migration and policies of migration.  The speaker series brings in people who work on these issues outside of the classroom and engaged us in learning beyond readings.  Ruxy is also fantastic! Our MFA trip as a group was also definitely a highlight! Figure out your research topic early and make use of the research design and draft deadlines for feedback.  Ruxy gives amazing feedback so it's definitely worth it to try to really figure out what you are going to write about.</comment></course>ENGLISH 261: Joyce/Beckett: Graduate Seminar</title>To those without antecedent experience with _Ulysses_ , be warned: you will be largely on your own when it comes to the nuts and bolts of how to read this expansive text.</comment>Hard to predict whether any group will come to a class with a lot of enthusiasm, but maybe the difficulty of these texts raises the possibility that people will in effect just sit it out.</comment>Avoid. Read Joyce and Beckett on your own time.</comment>I would say what I wrote above: take this course if you want to engage with the formal elements of these pieces. If you have little experience with Joyce or Beckett and want to get at the substance of what their respective works, you will find this course frustrating.</comment>If you like Joyce and Beckett going in, and if you want practice at the genres of modern scholarship, I would recommend the course. If you don't like those authors going in, I don't think this course will change your views.</comment></course>MODMIDEAST 125: Culture and Society in Contemporary Israel</title>One of my favorite classes taken at Harvard. Prof Kahn was amazing, the material was fascinating and the course was a great way to conduct discussion on Israeli culture y looking at it from its fringes. I loved this course!</comment>Take this course. Dr. Kahn provides an stressful environment to learn about Israel, a fascinating yet often controversial country in academic discourse. The workload is manageable and you will be given ample opportunity to succeed.</comment></course>ECON 1052: Game Theory and Economic Applications</title>Fantastic class if you're interested in game theory or logic. Otherwise, it'll be dull and difficult. A very self-selecting class. The problem sets are not as hard as everyone makes them out to be. Took on average 5-6 hours to figure them out, and another 1-2 to write up and make rigorous.</comment>Excellent class for students with a strong interest in Game Theory and a solid mathematical background.</comment>Understanding the problem sets in this course is not sufficient for your understanding of all material taught in this course. Attending section is a waste of an hour and a half per week. I recommend that you buy the textbook for this course.</comment>Read the book’s relevant sections before lecture. Things can be extremely difficult to follow otherwise. Take advantage of section – walking through problems interactively with Gleb was a much better learning experience that watching lecture. Fudenberg knows his stuff really well, but can be intimidating - make an effort to ask questions anyways, getting over that helped me learn a lot faster.</comment>The subject matter for this class is very interesting but requires strict attention to detailed definitions and complex notation. This course is very tough if you aren't willing to put in enough time to read the textbook and teach yourself. The TF isn't very helpful at all with homework so you must find others to work with and be willing to often turn in incomplete problem sets.</comment>Highly mathematical and rigorous treatment of game theory, so make sure you know what you're getting into. It's an interesting topic, but there's not much support from Drew or Gleb, you have to go out of your very much out of your way to get help and feel prepared</comment>It's a really neat class -- just be warned that it's also quite difficult. It's not to bad before the first midterm, but it gets a lot harder after that.</comment>Material is difficult, but workload is manageable. Very interesting if you like Econ and Math.</comment>I had been looking forward to this course since arriving to college, so I'm disappointed in the fact that it was not as good as I had been hoping. I find game theory to be a cool but somewhat frustrating subject--it is a lot of fairly obvious axioms that you push in circles and in messy casework in order to try to determine anything, and usually your solutions are not particularly enlightening. The course is quite easy up until dynamic games of incomplete information in like the last couple weeks, at which point it just becomes so tedious that I no longer found the subject fun. I think Fudenberg is obviously very smart but not necessarily the most patient instructor, and the assignments are for the most part not terrible. I still don't think I have properly understood many concepts in game theory, which is disappointing, though I'm not sure if that is my own fault or a flaw in the course instruction.</comment>It's a great class with fascinating material if you actually have time to learn it. The material is pretty difficult, in that most problems are not similar to ones you've seen before (yet still have a clear connection to course material). I didn't have time for the class, so I really suffered. First half of the class is pretty easy, though.</comment>It is a lot of work and very conceptually difficult.</comment>This class is super interesting and you learn a lot of useful material. If you like math, econ, and statistics, you should definitely consider this class. You get much better at problem solving and your understanding of theoretical economics improves greatly. the material is also well done, psets are difficult but not too difficult, and you learn so much in just one semester</comment>If you enjoyed 1011, definitely take this. It's not quite as time-consuming (Psets are comparable, but bi-weekly, and there are no projects). Most of the course is purely logical thinking and some math to back it up; if you really like problem solving and are interested in game theory, this is a fantastic class. Fudenberg is great.</comment>This class was really hard and the lectures, while very interesting, didn't really help with anything.  The problem sets were really hard and the midterm/final were impossible.  Take this class with caution.</comment>Take the class if you are interested in Nash, auction pricing, or decision making. It's quite hard and at times brutal as a lot of smart kids took it. Don't worry too much about grading though. As a senior, I enjoyed the class and if you do the readings you will get a lot out of it.</comment>It's really hard.</comment></course>ECON 2010c: Economic Theory</title>This course is extremely useful for all students in economics.</comment>Give the first part of this class the time it deserves. There is more to life than the Glaeser mid-term!</comment>Macro is not for everyone. David is one of my favorite teachers; he clearly presents the material, motivates it, provides context for the techniques we learn (mostly how to solve Bellman equations) from a variety of fields, and he seems to really care about the students.   Robert is one of my least favorite teachers; unless you're already passionate about growth theory, it's simply not an interesting class. He doesn't provide any explanation for why a non-growth theorist would care about this material, and has some weird disdain for the class.</comment>I would tell students that this is a difficult course. They must stay on top of the material in this course or they'll find themselves drowning in it to prepare for the final (which is the whole grade!).</comment>The first part of the usual graduate macro class.</comment></course>WOMGEN 1233: Gender, Sexual Violence, and Empire</title>Course materials are challenging, but illuminate the different realities of colonialism in relation to sexual violence, and raise important questions about the nature of colonialism and its continuing implications.</comment>The material in this class is fascinating, but often emotionally difficult. It combines literary texts about European colonialism, mostly in the Caribbean and Africa, with excerpts from post-colonial theorists. It is a really, really excellent way to be introduced to post-colonial theory, with a focus on gender and sexuality. It is also a wonderful literature class. Reading about the violences of colonialism is not necessarily the most fun thing in the world, but the texts we read are beautiful and fascinating pieces of writing, certainly worth the time. On top of all of this, Kate is a wonderful professor - very warm, very good both at giving feedback and facilitating discussion. The classroom environment was comfortable and engaging despite the difficulty of the topic we were approaching. Our whole class managed to bond in a nice way, and I attribute that to her.</comment>An incredible retrospective -- no curriculum could cover all of the texts that encompass sexual violence interlocking with colonialism -- but Professor Stanton's syllabus does an impressive job dealing with the multi-dimensional nature of gendered empire.</comment>This is a great class!!</comment>This is great but only if you are already interested in a somewhat familiar with feminist theory and the history/ongoing legacy of colonialism. The discussions took a lot of things for granted but that's useful/necessary sometimes.</comment></course>ECON 2450a: Public Economics and Fiscal Policy I</title>I don't care who you are, this is probably going to be one of the best courses you ever take.</comment>Raj is absolutely fantastic. He captures 100% of your attention during lecture. Also, you get to learn very useful techniques in applied econometrics.</comment>If you're at all interested in public economics, consider this course! If you've taken the undergrad version (1410) and liked it, take this course. Raj is absolutely amazing and very good at teaching, a rare combination--this is a fantastic opportunity to learn from one of the leaders in economics. He and Xavier (the TF this year) are also incredibly nice and approachable. This course delves into so many different interesting topics, from education to social mobility to tax reform and generally gives you a great introduction to how big data is reshaping economics. It's also a great opportunity to take a course with graduate students, whom you can also learn a lot from. The material and problem sets are not too difficult (and there are only 3 problem sets the entire semester), so it's not a huge workload, which is nice for a grad course. Comfortability with multivariable calculus is probably necessary though. There is alsoa replication exercise due towards the end of the semester, which will be pretty intense, particularly if you're not to familiar with STATA or taking apart economics papers. But seriously, consider this course. It is definitely one of the best at Harvard, and not one undergrads generally know about.</comment>This is THE course in public economics, no more and no less. Chetty is incredibly good as a teacher and very thought provoking as a scholar, this is the best you can get from a course in this field.</comment>Best class at Harvard</comment>Anyone with any interest in applied work in the social sciences should at least sit in on this class.</comment>Good class. Not as great as people would have you believe.</comment>It's a great introduction to Public Economics while also providing you a better intuition of econometrics</comment></course>WOMGEN 1424: American Fetish: Consumer Culture Encounters the Other</title>Great class, but there is a lot of reading. Make sure you are prepared for section, and it will be a rewarding experience.</comment>This is by far the best course I took at Harvard. If you have taken a course with Caroline Light, you know how amazing she is; she is brilliant and kind and cool. Truly an inspiring and careful teacher. Apply for the course! And if you get a spot, know that you just won the lottery, and your life will never be the same. :)</comment>TAKE THIS CLASS. It is not an overstatement to say that this class changed the way I think about the world. I wouldn't stop talking about this class all semester. Caroline fosters an incredibly safe space that allows for in depth and honest discussions of topical and often sensitive material. I think it is important that EVERYONE take a class like this one. Not to mention the fact that it is a BLAST. We were all friends by the end of it.</comment>Everyone should take this class!!!</comment>Prof. Light is WONDERFUL! Seriously. Meet her before you graduate. She is one of the best aspects of this class and so are the other students you'll get to engage deeply with. A lot of group work which can be frustrating and overwhelming. At times the class feels really repetitive but through you're focusing on a main theme there is a lot of depth.</comment>This class is phenomenal. It is a reading-heavy course, but well worth the effort. Do not pass up the opportunity to take this class if you get lotteried in!</comment>Caroline is incredible, and her thoughtfulness defines the course.  The readings are phenomenal, and your classmates will be some of the best you'll ever meet.  The projects are super engaging, and collaboration makes these projects even better.  Highly recommend taking this course!</comment>This class is amazing. The work is fun and rewarding, and you learn a ton. Professor Light is incredible, you MUST take a class with her before graduating.</comment></course>HISTSCI 130: Heredity and Reproduction</title>This was my favorite class this semester! Coming from a biology (HEB) background, it was so interesting and important to me to read the original texts that have created the foundation of Western thought about biology and reproduction in particular, and to see how ideas have been molded over time. Professor Richardson is wonderful and helps foster an environment for lively, thoughtful class discussions. Whether you are a History of Science concentrator or not, I highly recommend this course.</comment>Taking a class with Professor Richardson is 100% worth it!</comment></course>PHYSICS 295b: Quantum Theory of Solids</title>If you're interested in pursuing work in condensed matter theory or experiment you should really consider taking this course.</comment></course>EXPOS 10.011: Introduction to Expository Writing</title>Take this class if you have the opportunity to do so. Rebecca is a great teacher and by the time you are done with this class you will feel prepared to take on expos 20 and future college writing assignments. If you are at all questioning taking expos 10 or 20 take 10 first. The skills you learn there will be extremely beneficial in the long term.</comment>Take this class especially if you were recommended for it! It's extremely helpful especially because of all the individual attention we got. The workload is extremely manageable</comment>It was the BEST decision of my freshman year!</comment>This course is a great start to writing at Harvard especially if you aren't completely confident about your writing abilities.</comment>If you get placed into expos 10, then definitely take it. It gives valuable skills for the rest of your life.</comment></course>MUSIC 201a: Current Methods in Historical Musicology</title>You will have the most interesting conversations of your life in this class.</comment>This is a great way not only to get to know the field of historical musicology, but also to explore its intersections with other disciplines.</comment>It is one of the best classes that I have ever taken.</comment>It's The Best!</comment></course>HIST 1526: European Legal History</title>A solid introduction to legal history and historical debates on the law. Professor Herzog is a good lecturer and very accessible outside of class. Workload is quite manageable, but you still learn a lot by doing the "bare bones" reading.</comment>This class provides a great survey of European Legal History. Though many law school students also take the class, it is by no means inaccessible to undergraduates, and the workload was very reasonable. Professor Herzog is so funny and very well-versed in the material. Definitely take this course if you have a passing interest!</comment>This course will give you a new perspective on the role of law in history. Professor Herzog is extremely knowledgeable—and committed to teaching ("lecture" is more of a discussion," she reads and comments on all exams/papers).</comment>This class was an excellent introduction to the history of European law. No prior background is necessary, and Professor Herzog is amazing! The "lectures" (more like seminars than anything) and readings were very interesting and informative. The exam were reasonable and the research paper was actually fun. It was a very comprehensive class - you'll definitely get a lot from it. Five stars!</comment>This is a fascinating class in which you will both learn the basic outlines of a broad swath of European history and learn a significant amount of legal history.</comment>Do well on the midterm, not a lot of grades for this class</comment>Devote time to doing the readings, at least of the primary texts. Makes the class much more worth it.</comment></course>HAA 282k: Art of Indian Esoteric Buddhism</title>Esoteric Buddhist Art in medieval India might sound like an obscure area but this is a very important foundation if you're interested at all in Buddhist/Indian art. Professor Kim is not just amazingly erudite but brings the material to life. She is also approachable, resourceful, and extremely supportive of her students.</comment>If you are at all interested in engaging with an admittedly difficult set of materials, I can't think of a better way than this class.</comment></course>LITER 146: Space and Place: The Environment in Film</title>This is an incredible course, thought provoking and informative. Verena is also an excellent professor! Take this course!</comment></course>SOCIOL 115: Media and Popular Culture</title>If you are interested in media, definitely take this class. The subject matter is super fun and the assignments allow you to study what you are passionate about.</comment>You don't need to do most of the reading. Section was a waste of time, lectures were interesting but no exams.</comment>Great class and great chance to meet Prof. Kaliner</comment>Though there is a lot of writing for this course, it helps you to think about the world in a new way.</comment>It was super interesting and not very hard, especially if you are into the material. I liked coming to lecture</comment>This course is a unique course offered at harvard that engages in relevant topics to the 21st century.</comment>This class is great if you want to explore the cultural world around you or delve into a social phenomenon that has always interested you. It's not an incredibly difficult class to keep up with, but you'll get the most out of it if you're willing to engage with the readings and in-class discussions.</comment>This course is a fabulous way to academically explore a very fun topic. People were always surprised that I got to bring my love of pop culture and celebrities into the classroom.</comment>This is a great class with interesting content and a good workload. It is fairly easy (assignment-wise) if you like writing papers. All of the papers are on interesting material and there are not any exams. I'd recommend it!</comment>Seems interesting, but it's not what you expect</comment>Even though I've never taken a sociology class before, I'm really glad that I went ahead and took this class! This class is insanely interesting! You'll learn a lot about the material and get to explore things that interest you personally, as well. Go to lectures and sections! The discussions and material are really engaging. I definitely recommend this class to anyone who just finds the media and different aspects of culture interesting.</comment>I really enjoyed this course. The material is relevant and interesting, and Prof Kaliner is great. You do have to write a few essays (5) but four are pretty short and the topics are fun.</comment>Lots of fun and will definitely change the way you see the world, as media is all around us.  You will be more aware of not just the content, but the implications of other aspects of media (the length, the medium, etc.).</comment>absolutely take this class! it is pretty easy but also a lot of fun and actually interesting. you'll want to go to lecture, and probably even do the readings. the professor is great, and can gauge how lecture is going--if he thinks something is getting boring, he'll say "ok, this is getting boring, let's move on." so lecture's are always engaging. going to office hours is great too, and he'll talk about anything and everything. there are 4 papers and a final research paper, but they're not hard at all, and very flexible so you can write about anything you want. overall, one of my favorite sociology classes--it was fun but also informative</comment>Super fun and interesting class! Very applicable to our world today and everyday lives</comment>This course is an interesting survey of media and popular culture, with many relevant sections that apply to contemporary times. The assignments were sporadically spaced throughout the semester, often with little time between the prompt release date and the due date, making some week sin the class more intense than others in terms of workload.</comment>GREAT CLASS. Matt is the man. Go to his office hours. He has so much knowledge about life that you will learn a ton. Class was very interesting. Great class discussions in the lecture and in section. You need to write a couple essays but they are all interesting. Take this class.</comment>This course was enjoyable in general. The professor is nice and willing to meet with students, and facilitates good discussions in lecture. 

However, there were some downsides to this course that are worth considering. It was somewhat all over the place in terms of topics discussed, for one, so that I don't feel particularly enlightened upon completion about popular culture as a sociological phenomenon, though some readings were interesting on their own. I also felt that lectures were disorganized and the professor was often several minutes late. The grading was bizarrely harsh and seemed random at times, and expectations for assignments upon which grades seemed to be awarded were not clearly defined or explained.</comment>Not as interesting as what meets the eye.  The lecturers were dry and there were a lot of papers and a lot of readings.  The papers were graded more harshly than expected.  A lot of info on theories and less on culture and media.</comment>This is a great class to take as an elective or for a requirement. It would also be great for athletes in season because it requires very little work outside of class. Sections are lively and and it's there that you really learn most of the material on a relatable level.</comment>This class is interesting and applies to the real world.</comment>not an easy A, not a great lecturer, but interesting material.  take the class if you have a passion for this stuff</comment></course>SOC-WORLD 47: Contemporary South Asia: Entrepreneurial Solutions to Intractable Social & Economic Problems</title>This is an awesome class that you can learn a ton from if you invest time in it. Even if you don't invest that much time, you will naturally gain a lot of really interesting insight into social innovation/entrepreneurship and South Asia. Definitely take this course.</comment>Great class to take. Makes you realize how you can make a business that also solves a need in a community. I learned how to think about businesses in the government/NGO ecosystem through this class. At the same time, I was able to learn a lot about South Asia and current initiatives and needs in the area. The class maybe somewhat disorganized, though. Prof. Khanna's HBS-style lectures were my favorite because we got a chance to see how he and other students in the class look at different initiatives and say what contributed to their success or lack thereof.</comment>great experiment of a class!</comment>Awesome course. Being in a room with people from all across Harvard is a phenomenal experience and should certainly be taken advantage of. DEFINITELY TAKE THIS if you have even the slightest interest in South Asia. From learning about urban planning and heritage preservation, to micro-finance and social entrepeneurship strategies, this multi-faceted course is by far the greatest course I have taken ever.</comment>Very interesting class- great way to learn about social entrepreneurship and cultural and institutional context in South Asia. Very broad modules- so come willing to explore a breadth of topics.</comment>It's a great multidisciplinary course for people interested in international development, entrepreneurship, developing countries, and the region. It might be a bit intimidating because a lot of people have an extensive background in the region, but it won't be held against you as long as you do the readings. Professor Khanna is very knowledgeable and guest speakers were interesting as well.</comment>TAKE THIS COURSE. What a gem, my god. Teaching staff is super into the course. Material is great. Assignments are actually interested and very manageable. 

Take this one - you will not regret taking this course!!11!!11</comment>This is a bit different from most courses at Harvard.  While most classes tend to give you content that you then have to replicate/regurgitate on exams and other types of assignments, the point of this class is more to help you develop a skill set that you can then take with you beyond Harvard to make a difference outside the classroom.  For that reason I think the class is worth taking, since you have the opportunity to read and hear about the successes (and more importantly, failures) of predecessors in the field who have tried tackling problems in South Asia, through the guest lectures and case studies.  Professor Khanna is an incredibly smart man, and while at first it may seem hard to connect with him, if you do get the chance I would HIGHLY recommend it (he holds occasional office hours where he does 1-on-1 meetings, sign up!), since he is an incredible resource to have.  In terms of the class itself, in the short term it may seem a-okay due to issues such as disconnected guest lectures and somewhat arbitrary grading, but coming out of the class you will see that you have developed invaluable experience that will help you in the future.</comment>this is such an amazing class. it is really not that hard, but you learn so much that is so relevant to our lives. definitely go to lectures, and do the readings (theres not much). the final project is really fun, and it's great working with grad students. the syllabus and introduction to the course make it seem a bit daunting, but it is very manageable and enjoyable. definitely one of my favorite classes so far</comment>This class was a great way to satisfy the Societies of the World gened. It is far from a gem, and requires much more work than certain gened courses. It is great if you have any interest in India or entrepreneurship. It is also the only class at Harvard where there is no lottery to take a class that involves HBS case studies.</comment>Get used to the case style format and that the class will have a lot of graduate school students. You have to make an effort to stay engaged.</comment>This is a great interdisciplinary class about South Asia, with a strong focus on India.  Prof. Khanna is wonderful, and I loved the HBS cases that we covered.  Some of the many assignments are annoying and slightly time consuming but other than that a totally manageable gen ed!</comment>This class is amazing! It gave me a new framework to think about social problems prevalent in South Asia, and creative ways to begin solving them.</comment>Take this class, it will broaden your mind and allow you to bring your own individual academic experiences, be they in mathematics, linguistics, philosophy or computer science, to a stage where you can have meaningful impact. This class is about using your education to do something productive, and is one of the few Harvard classes that allows you to feel that kind of empowerment. One of the best classes of my four years.</comment>Take this class if you are fascinated with India and seriously plan to be an entrepreneur there. Otherwise, find a different class.</comment>This class is awesome to engage with contem. SA issues and it's a very painless gen ed too. You get what you put into this course, so if you take it seriously, you'll learn a lot. Teaching staff is very engaging and the content is super interesting.</comment>This class is really interesting, but the lectures are hit and miss.</comment></course>CHNSE 142a: Advanced Conversational Chinese</title>If you want to maintain your chinese ability, but don't have the time (or the mental stamina) to take 140 this is an awesome choice. Being one of 5 students means you get tons of time to practice speaking and listening, and you are accountable for following the discussion and participating in it.</comment>This class is fun and low stress. It's also super useful, because these are the topics that you talk about everyday, and you learn how to speak intelligently about these topics in Chinese. Want to talk about race relations, religion, or politics without being super offensive? Take this class and learn about different cultures, and how to communicate with them in Chinese. Plus, this is the most fun you'll ever have in a class, reward all your hard work in Chinese, take this class.</comment>This course is a great option if you want to keep up your Chinese, but don't have time to devote to one of the other classes. The level of Chinese spoken and taught will depend a lot on the other people who take the class.</comment>The learning environment is relaxed and with a small class, my fluency improved. The topics discussed are also interesting.</comment>This course is actually great for improving your speaking skills (surprise surprise), particularly if you were someone that was always nervous to speak up in previous Chinese classes. It is also nice because you are watching real articles and movies. Also so much less work than any other chinese class ever.</comment></course>FRSEMR 36s: Comparative Historical Mythology</title>This class can be whatever you want it to be. There is almost no reading or work assigned and Professor Witzel is very open to listening to students' ideas. However, as there is no hand-holding, if you don't put in the person effort (which you don't need to do to pass), you are unlikely to find this class rewarding.</comment>The material is interesting, but the quality of the class is what you make it, and with everyone straining to hear the professor, discussion was rather limited.</comment>Very unique class topics</comment>If you don't like to write long papers, I would not recommend this course. Also, if you like structure in this course, this is not the one for you. Very little work is required, and it is a fun class. Make sure to come into class with questions From the week's homework.</comment>Course material may be interesting if you are into ancient mythology, but unfortunately although professor Witzel is a nice person and really flexible with deadlines, he speaks way too softly for you to hear anything if you sit more than one seat away from him.</comment>Interesting if you are genuinely interested in mythology, would not recommend unless you really like mythology.</comment></course>COMPSCI 121: Introduction to the Theory of Computation</title>Given that I came in with no real proof-based background (the last time I did proofs was at a math camp the summer after my sophomore year of high school), it was a difficult course. That said, it wasn't impossible — I don't know how much CS20 really would have helped with it seeing as many of the topics seemed self-contained, and were "easy" enough to grasp with just the book and course material. I took it when I didn't have to (I'm not a CS concentrator), and I don't regret it. It was a good course, Harry Lewis seemed like he was invested in teaching it, and most of the TF's were willing to help (though some were rather snarky). It's interesting material, and I feel like it's worth knowing.</comment>Wish it wasn't required of CS concentrators because its a very very hard class for those of us who don't have a strong math background. It is a good class though. If you don't have much math background (even if you took CS20) might be smart to go over some of the material and notation beforehand, that probably would have made the class a bit less painful.</comment>Make sure you have exposure to this type of math before, don't be huberistic and take CS20 if you did not take Math 25+</comment>This is not a very difficult course if you go to lectures, section, and put in the work for the assignments. Go to office hours because they are great for getting the problem sets done, and done correctly.</comment>This class is very interesting but will definitely require a lot of time since there are problem sets every single week - no time to digest information in between psets.</comment>Looking at the Q Guide you can see that there are a lot of people who don't like this course. But honestly, it is a great class. I think most of the people who don't like it are the more traditional CS students. But, if you are coming from another discipline (like Physics or Math), I think it can be a lot of fun! The problems are very well laid out and fun to figure out how to solve. It is more of an exercise in thinking in creative ways than anything else. Definitely would recommend this class to science and math people. You definitely learn a lot. This is probably in the top 8 classes I have taken at Harvard in my 4 years here.</comment>Would not recommend. Hate theory, hate math, hate proofs, don't understand anything. It's mandatory anyway so you're screwed. My section TF was amazing though. Go to Office Hours, they rock and will get so much help. Also team up with classmates (up to 4 collaborators). Tests aren't that bad.</comment>If you love math and computer science, particularly abstract math, then this class is for you. It is not however, particularly enthralling.</comment>1) Unfortunately you have to take this class. Bummer. 
2) The material is pretty boring and not really relevant to anything you'll ever do in the field of computer science or at a job
3) Know proof math coming in, otherwise this class will be extremely difficult</comment>If you are concentrating in CS, you have to take this class. That being said, it can be a very interesting class, and touches upon topics that you can go into further.</comment>Only take it if it is required.</comment>Some people may feel that this class has no practical use; however, I would say that it teaches students how to approach problems from a computational point of view. I can see how these underlying concepts may come in useful in the future. That being said, lecture/section/textbook all cover the same material in various ways. I would say you could pick 2 of them and ignore 1.</comment>I found the material of this course very interesting.  It's pretty cool how far you can go in terms of complexity theory with a few basic math tools.  I'm glad it's a requirement for the CS department, what with so many of us having a more applied/programming focus.  That said, I think it could be taught a bit better.  Lewis seems bored by the material, and he often was more or less reading off of slides.  Reading Sipser was honestly more helpful than watching the lectures.</comment>Don't bother going to lecture, section covers the material just as well and in a less confusing manner. Lewis is not a very good lecturer, and constantly makes mistakes in his slides and explanations. It's frankly a little unacceptable how many times it happened this semester.</comment>If you're not a CS concentrator, I don't recommend taking this class. It's incredibly difficult and most people who didn't need to take it had trouble motivating themselves to do the problem sets well.</comment>If you are strong at proof based math, this class is definitely manageable. I don't have much computer science background but more math and found this class very enjoyable. Don't go to lecture. They're very dry and unnecessary to learn the material. Instead read the textbook and go to section. Those and going to office hours, finding a good pset group will make you get a good grade in this class.</comment>Read Sipser. Keep up in class. Go to office hours. The exams are extremely fair. It's not difficult to do well (even coming in without a proofs background) because of the way the class is structured--75% is psets/midterm and the lowest gets dropped. I think it's one of those classes that teaches not the most interesting topic in the world but definitely something worth knowing about in general.</comment>This class is clearly a lot different from most other CS classes early in your curriculum. You won't be writing code or debugging; instead, you'll be gaining a mathematically rigorous introduction to problems in computability theory, algorithmic complexity, etc. Some of the topics (particularly near the end of the course) are very interesting and seem like important issues. The first half of the course isn't terrible, but it was sometimes very hard to grasp the motivations or significance behind concepts. I did not attend lecture for most of the class; I thought Prof. Lewis was perfectly fine, but the lecture slides (in combination with the Sipser textbook) were definitely good enough to cover the material.

In terms of difficulty, the class was not terrible. The workload was substantial, but not overwhelming; I spent around 5-8 hours per week on problem sets, in most cases. The problem sets are interesting, and they make up a very large portion of the final grade, which makes it not too hard to do well in the class. In terms of background/prerequisites, you just need to be able to think about and write tight, mathematically rigorous proofs. If you can do that (or are willing to work a little harder to pick up the skill), you'll be fine.</comment>CS121 is interesting and necessary for future classes, but definitely not the highlight of the cs department.</comment>If you're a CS concentrator you're going to have to take this class, and you'll probably be pretty ambivalent toward it.

If you're not a CS concentrator, you're not going to take this class.</comment>I took this class expecting it to be a joke, but it actually turned out to be a lot more difficult than I was expecting. I'm not really sure why it's required for all CS concentrators, but you learn some really interesting stuff. Lecture isn't really worth attending, but the textbook (Sipser) is pure gold, and section is great too. I would strongly recommend finding a study group and going to office hours if you haven't had much experience with proofs and/or sets.</comment>Coming to lecture is boring, but the best parts are section and office hours. The hardest thing is being formal with proofs.</comment>The course textbook Sipser is clear and thorough in explaining concepts and the class pretty much follows the textbook. Problem sets take a lot of time and you should definitely plan to go to at least one office hours for each pset. Also, for the exams, do all the practice midterms and final exams first before reviewing material. There is a lot that is not going to be tested in the exams.</comment>If you are a CS major you probably have to take this. It's actually more interesting than you think. Not particularly applicable for me but I guess it's a good perspective on theoretical computer science.</comment>This is a fine class. You're probably taking it because you have to, but if not I would still recommend it. If you've never done proofs before you can still totally do fine in the course, and you'll gain a decent bit of mathematical maturity in the process(really a basis for further exploration--you get exposed to basic ideas like proof by construction/contradiction, reduction, etc. which are staples of mathematical activity). 

The class does become slightly more involved as the semester goes on, but the material becomes more interesting and significant as time goes on(you'll go from drawing finite automata to dealing with P vs. NP, one of the most famous unsolved problems in all of mathematics).

Professor Lewis is not the most compelling lecturer, but can be pretty funny at times. Most people don't attend lecture(the class had 150 in it this year but only 15 or so would be at any given lecture) and I'd say that watching the videos at 1.5x speed is probably the best way to go. Lecture can be pretty slow and we sometimes get bogged down in details that we won't ever really need, even for the problem sets and exams--in fall fairness I understand Lewis is just trying to give things proper context a lot of the time. Sipser is great, so read that over attending lecture if you're ever really pressed for time. 

Also, the grades on problem sets tend to be pretty high, so make sure you clearly explain your solutions in detail and check your work twice! I felt at times that TFs had to take points off for irrelevant things just to bring the mean down. Also, do always try the extra credit! Even if you don't get towards an answer they're good exercises, and if other people do them then it'll be tougher to be ahead of the curve.</comment>Not useful at all.</comment>I don't know why this class gets such a bad reputation and Q Score.  I am a statistics concentrator and I thought that this class was really enjoyable.  The stuff we learned felt like a good use of time and I'm glad I learned it!  The PSets were well designed and everything seemed fair.  Plus, Lewis is fun!</comment>Come into the class with an open mind and some of the material can get quite interesting near the end of the course with the perennial P vs NP problem and other important computational theories. If you are the theoretical/mathematical type, this course is suitable for you!</comment>I thought this was a solid course. Reasonable problem sets, reasonable exams. The textbook for the course is excellent. You can do well by just reading the textbook each week rather than going to lecture.</comment>If you're a CS concentrator, you're required to take this class.  Thankfully, it's not that bad.  The lectures are usually pretty boring and not very well attended, but you can usually get by via reading the book and reading the lecture slides.  The pace of the class is slow which is great since the material does get difficult.  Overall, it's a tough CS course but it certainly won't destroy your semester.</comment>I really enjoyed this course, and it definitely helped round out my appreciation for what CS is as a discipline.  If you work hard on the problem sets you should be well prepared for the exams.</comment>If you at all may be interested in theoretical computer science, you pretty much have to take this class. Considering this class is required of all CS concentrators, you'll probably take this class whether you want to or not, but don't see it as a bad thing necessarily; some aspects of this class are actually really enjoyable!</comment>Not really worth taking unless you have to.  Material easy to learn by yourself.</comment>I totally understand why this is a required course for CS: it's a great reminder that computer science != programming, and that there's actually some really cool theory behind it. Lewis isn't the most exciting lecturer, and the pace of the class is pretty slow if you have any background in proof-based math, but the material mostly makes up for that (especially when you get past automata to the P vs. NP part of the class!). I haven’t heard much about 125, but I’d recommend shopping/taking it instead if you want to learn this stuff from a more mathematically rigorous perspective.</comment>CS requirement, can't help it. But still very useful stuff. Just do like what everybody says: don't go to lecture and just read Sipser. That's the way to go.</comment>This class is very hard. The psets take a really long time but they are manageable.</comment>Material is tough but the class is well structured and well organized.  If you think you will struggle with the material, take CS20 in the spring.  Then just rip the bandaid with this one.</comment>Professor Lewis is not bad -- not extremely engaging, but very knowledgeable.  The material is really interesting.  If you have a strong math background, this course may very well be easy for you, if not, it may be a struggle (people who've already taken 124 tend to have a very easy time with this class).</comment>Well, you all have to take this course since it is a CS requirement. The sort of nice thing is that you get to meet a lot of CS concentrators, and Harry Lewis is an interesting character. The drawback is that the content is probably not something you are going to be that interested in, and if you are good at formal mathematics you will find the course pretty easy. I recommend it - but only because if you didn't take it you wouldn't get your CS degree.</comment>CS 121 is a very gentle introduction to theoretical computer science, and I definitely recommend taking it earlier rather than later (coming from someone who took it junior fall). While your possible suspicion that it won't make you a better developer or be useful in your future career is certainly founded, it is useful in that it teaches you to translate mathematical skills into the world of CS and allows you to looks at the problems of computer science and understand them – something anyone involved in technology should be able to do.</comment>If you're a CS concentrator, you have to take this class. It's not bad, nor is it difficult--I felt like I learned a decent amount from lectures, though the first half of the course moves excruciatingly slowly. That said, it doesn't take up too much time, especially if you read Sipser instead of going to lecture.</comment>It's pretty helpful to have taken CS20 before CS121. If you don't have any formal proof background, the class may be a bit difficult to adjust to. The section TFs were awesome - especially Tom. He was the most helpful TF ever, and he made the material a lot easier to understand. 

Expect this class to take around 5-10 hours a week for you.</comment>I don't think this class should be required of CS concentrators. It is definitely useful though, and reasonably difficult and time consuming. Harry Lewis is a very entertaining and interesting teacher. The class is very reasonable overall and relatively painless, I just wish I didn't have to take it because it seemed like a waste of a class to me.</comment>I was a little afraid to take this course because of the prerequisites, as I did not have any experience with proofs, since I decided not to take Math 23 or CS20. But, I felt that I was strong enough mathematically to take this course, and I sure am glad that I did. I really gained a lot from this course, in addition to learning to write proofs, it really made me think in a different way and expanded my problem solving abilities.

But, there are some concerns. The lectures are absolutely useless. Harry Lewis is a very slow teacher, and you can probably watch his lectures at 2x speed, but even that might not be necessary. You can learn all the material needed for this course from the textbook, Sipser, which is a godsend.</comment>If you're CS you have to take. Try to not get behind or it can get difficult quickly. Also make sure you do very well on the psets</comment>You have to take it, and it can be illuminating, but you probably won't like it.</comment>It's the class you kind of just have to take. It isn't awful, and ultimately, you do learn. It's not taught particularly well (not going to lecture will not hurt you - just read Sipser, seriously) and there definitely isn't as much content taught as could be. If you have a math background, you could take this freshman fall. If you don't, any CS experience will help, and it'll be a bit tougher. That being said, don't expect it to be hard or particularly fascinating, but don't expect it to be torturous.</comment>It's a great class, and the material is really interesting. That being said, the teaching staff (unless you have a really great TF), doesn't really make it that engaging -- it almost feels as if the class plods along and just drones through material. But stick with it -- the content of the course is actually really cool when you step back and look at it!</comment>The material can be interesting sometimes, but if you're already comfortable with mathematical proofs, then you should probably take CS 125 to get through the CS 121 material at a faster pace (assuming that CS 125 still does justice to CS 124, which I can't say for sure).</comment>I think that this is a really important class to take for computer science. While it was challenging and definitely took a lot of consistent work throughout the semester, I learned a lot. If I had looked at our final exam when I first started the class, I would not have even known what was being asked or how to begin solving the problem. But by the end of the semester, I knew how to solve difficult problems and understood their applications.</comment>I would like them to realize that this course is a department requirement. I'm sure Professor/Dean Lewis is a great administrator that loves undergraduate education and is an excellent administrator and department head, but I find it unfortunate that he should be forced to spend some time teaching this course which could benefit from having a different course head. Perhaps after having taught the class for some many years, Professor Lewis feels as if less time can be spent on the course but the course feels as if it could use a fresh look. The material is relevant, interesting and important and I would love to be able to recommend the course to people even remotely interested in CS because of how much the material should be exciting. Unfortunately, it feels that I can only describe the course as a concentration credit and nothing else. That is a major shame. 

The course is very doable for anyone. Those afraid of proofs or concerned about their math background or not having taken CS20 probably shouldn't be worried. The course requires sharp thinking which all Harvard students possess. The psets take some time to do, especially for those new to the subject area but the course is not a time black hole. Work wise, its very doable and the material is interesting and applicable, even if that is not immediately obvious.</comment>Lecture can be a bit dry, but the material was actually more interesting than I expected (though most of it will come directly from Sipser). Assignments can be extremely challenging, especially if this is your first proof-based class (as it was for me). Try not to be discouraged - just make sure to go to office hours and, if needed, find a tutor through the BSC. You will get through it, and you may actually end up liking it.</comment>Despite what people may say about cs121, it is a really good class.  Read the textbook and you'll be set.  Be prepared to form a study group / attend office hours to get through some of the psets, but the exams are really fair.  Overall it's a pretty good class and lays a solid foundation in computational theory.</comment>Read Sipser! It's the best textbook that I've used for a course. Make sure to check psets with classmates and to go to office hours.</comment>Have a relatively strong theoretical math background (at the level of cs20)</comment>1) you have to take it if you're a CS major 2) you'll like it if you're into math 3) it actually turns out it's pretty useful</comment>If you've never done serious formal proofs before, get some guidance from a TF earlier rather than later. If that technical stuff isn't a problem then the course shouldn't be too hard at all.</comment>If you've taken Math 25 or up and thought it was a decent class, not unmanageable, then avoid 121 by all means. It's a waste of time, and you would get much more reward from 125. Regardless of what you've heard about how hard 125, 121 is just a total waste of a semester.

If you have no proof training but still want to major in CS, then take 121, I guess.

As for the class itself, Lewis is well prepared for lectures, but he's a godawful boring lectures. I never managed to go to class; I tried for a while to watch the recordings, but even then I could get through three lecture's worth of material by reading the textbook in the time it took Lewis to teach half a lecture.</comment>It's really not hard if you already have a proof based math background. The problem sets were also fun to do, and mostly doable without help.</comment>Please take CS20 if you're not used to writing proofs / formal mathematic notation like I was. It immensely helped me. This class is difficult, but definitely doable if you have the right support network. We were allowed to work in groups on the problem sets, which was good for my mental health.</comment>If you're taking this course, it's because you're required to.</comment>It's a good course, but the material isn't directly applicable to coding (you won't write code in this class) and it's highly theoretical.</comment>This is a sad implementation of a theory course. The material is interesting, but Harry's lectures are not. It's a pity that the only required course is so poorly taught.</comment>This course is difficult, but necessary. It wasn't till halfway through that I realized how valuable some of the material is. While you'll never apply it directly while programming, it definitely further your understanding of computers as a whole. The end of the course on P vs. NP is particularly interesting. Lectures are poorly taught, so section and more importantly the textbook will be very useful. I strongly recommend taking CS20 before taking this, your grade will thank you.</comment>This class is actually more interesting than you would think. The problems that we work on are very satisfying to think through, and it gives you great experience in proofs. It is manageable without prior experience in higher math, as long as you are willing to put the work in. The lectures are fairly dull, but it is possible to learn the material without relying on them.</comment>This course is definitely do-able. While you might be intimidated coming into it since it does have the potential to be an extremely difficult class, if you read through Sipser in detail and STUDY WITH OTHER PEOPLE, you will find that the course material is not bad at all. I thought it was easier than Stat 110.</comment>You learn a lot about a very interesting area of computer science.  The course is well taught, and the textbook matches up nicely to it.  Professor Lewis's anecdotes and historical asides keep things interesting in a good way.  If you ever have issues, you can get them sorted out in section.  Only one other student ever showed up for my section, so I had a lot of opportunity to get help.  Also, Piazza helps a lot with the problem sets.  The problem sets can be challenging, but you get to drop one.  And the tests are much easier than the problem sets.  I would recommend taking this class even if you're not a CS major, provided you like mathematical proofs and logic.</comment>This is a really good class. It taught me a lot. I absolutely loved how helpful the teaching fellows were at office hours. Gabe and Ben were my favorite :) Just be ready to work hard outside of your class. Your critical thinking skills will definitely improve if you take this class.</comment>Psets are really important (75% of grade), so stay on top of them. Exams are straightforward but difficult.</comment>I mean if you're a CS concentrator you don't have much choice....</comment>If you're a CS major, might as well get it over with. The material was unexpectedly engaging, and it really changes the way you think about the notion of computation, which is fantastic. But in the end, I'm glad I got it over with.</comment>It's a math class, not a CS class.</comment>Sipser is the best textbook I've ever used. And boy did I use it a lot. This class starts out really slow, but the content gets more interesting and actually applicable to real life toward the end. Depending on how good you are at math, problem sets are pretty tough. All in all I appreciate the content matter of the class as a whole, but the way this class was taught made it really uninteresting. Don't expect to get any useful feedback from assignments.</comment>I love this class. It was hard for me (minimal proof-y background), that's for sure, but I learned awesome amounts. CS 121 <3.</comment>Lectures are pretty dry and a bit hard to pay attention to. The material itself also isn't the most interesting thing in the world, but Sipser is a good resource.</comment>read the relevant chapters of textbook and watch the lectures if  you have time</comment>This class is pretty boring unless you are mathematically minded. If you're a CS concentrator you have to take it, so tough luck. If you aren't a CS concentrator, I'd advise you to ask yourself, "Do I like math?" before enrolling in this course. It's not very hard though if you have some mathematical background, just boring.</comment>Only take tins course if you have prior interest or if you need it as a prereq</comment>Challenging course.  P-sets will take a lot of time, office hours are a must.  Read Sipser</comment>It's a good class that everyone interested in computer science should take. As someone who's more interested in the engineering side of computer science, it wasn't my favorite class, but it was definitely well worth my taking it.</comment></course>ARABIC 251r: Classical Arabic Texts: Seminar</title>You should have at least three years of Arabic or the equivalent and be familiar with classical grammar.</comment>Professor El-Rouayheb is both an excellent Arabic teacher and an excellent teacher of analyzing historical content. Write down every word he says.</comment>You will thoroughly enjoy this course - prepare to put your Arabic to the test! A great informative course.</comment>If you're command of Arabic is already advanced, this class is an excellent opportunity to force yourself to engage with advanced Arabic texts many hours a week. Be ready to do most of the work on your own. That is, to sit for hours alone with the text and two or three dictionaries on the side. If don't like that prospect, don't take the course. On the other hand, it is the best possible training for working with pre-modern Arabic primary sources, with the best possible instructor to provide it.</comment>This a great course for anyone interested in intellectual and educational history.</comment></course>ECON 980x: Economics of Work and Family</title>Goldin is basically the forerunner in this field for the kind of work she does. If this subject material is interesting to you at all, take it. And do the readings -- if you don't, the class is essentially useless. It's all on your own proactivity to learn.</comment>This course is fantastic. The subject is amazing and engaging and Claudia is the expert in the field. Since the class is small, you get to know Claudia, Andy and the class, which doesn't happen often in econ. This was by far my favorite class this semester. Claudia is brilliant and quirky. The class really gets you to think differently about economics and how to write an econ paper. I highly recommend taking it if you are at all interested.</comment>Take this class if you are trying to decide whether to write a senior thesis. The course is structured to guide you through the research process in a very manageable way. Professor Goldin and our TF Andy Garin were extremely patient, encouraging, and generous with their time.</comment>This is really a wonderful course. Professor Goldin is an outstanding professor and willing to go our of her way to help students succeed. The weekly time commitment is minimal although if you don't do the required reading you will not get nearly as much out of it. The final paper was difficult but extremely rewarding.</comment>It's a privilege to receive guidance on a research paper from one of the nation's most prominent economists. Take this class!</comment>Interesting topic, low workload but a lot is expected of you - be prepared, Claudia will challenge you!</comment>The material is very interesting and extremely relevant, and the teaching staff can't be beat. Do start the paper early, though, because it's not fun to have a research paper of that size creep up on you. Other than that, this class really pushes you to think about how economic theory can be applied to real life, and is well worth taking.</comment></course>EXPOS 10.010: Introduction to Expository Writing</title>The preceptors that teach this course are good however it might be worth skipping it and going straight to expos 20 to save time and energy. Although I learnt a lot (since English is my second language), I would not recommend this course to people completely fluent in English</comment>Through Expos 10, you gain an appreciation for the writing process.</comment>Rebecca is the sole reason I am able to ace my essays and reports in my other classes. She is great and really knows what she's doing. Super cute lady, and knows how to make writing enjoyable. She changed my whole perspective.</comment>It really does prepare you for the essays you are going to have to write at Harvard, and this course just gives you extra support.</comment></course>CULTR&BLF 60: Religion in India: Texts and Traditions in a Complex Society</title>Great class, one of my favorites this semester. Provides you with a great overview of the different religions that have been prominent at some point or another in Indian history.</comment>The lectures are interesting but are kind of frustrating in how they are organized. Also, the grading is not ideal because so much of it is at the tail end of the class.</comment>This was a great course. I think I particularly enjoyed it because it is one of the few courses that I've taken at Harvard where I didn't have any background knowledge of the subject, so I learned an incredible amount during the course. Professor Eck is amazing and she takes the time to get to know everyone in the course, and she really cares about each student learning the material (even if you're not 110% interested in the material, it is worth it to take a course with her). My only complaint about this course is that I really have no idea what my grade will be because the major assessments were a term paper and an exam at the end of the semester, so I'm not sure how that will turn out. Regardless, it was a great course, and I definitely would recommend it to anyone!</comment>Professor Eck is a really wonderful professor to have in any class. I was also lucky enough to be in her section. Make sure to do the readings, otherwise you're just hurting yourself in section and lecture. Lecture meets a little too often for my liking.</comment>This class is fantastic and a great introduction to the complex religious world of India, also Professor Eck is a joy work with!</comment>It was a little harder to keep up with than I expected but completely worth it for Diana Eck's lectures.</comment>This is an excellent class. Professor Eck is a wonderful lecturer, and the texts you engage with are extremely interesting, as is the topic. The workload is not at all overwhelming, and very doable. If you are at all interested in India or in religion, this is a great class to take.</comment>This class is an extraordinary introduction to the religious traditions of India. While the breadth of material covered may seem daunting at first, the teaching is excellent, and makes sure this course never falters. Dr. Eck is a remarkably knowledgeable and kind professor whose lectures are always great to listen to, while the TFs are excellent at facilitating discussion in section; I was very impressed by the helpful suggestions my TF,  Paul Schwerda, gave me on improving my written work, and it was always wonderful discussing the course material in section. It is really wonderful how many source texts you get to read; this enables you to truly engage with the material on your own. Highly recommended to anyone interested in India; while a little background in India could help with learning the names of people in the readings, it is probably not necessary.</comment>This class is amazing and being taught by Professor Eck is a treat. Check out the syllabus. Take it if you want to learn a lot and think deeply about the role of spiritual texts and traditions in a society/in peoples' lives/in your life.</comment>If you have a strong interest in ancient Indian texts then take this class! If you are more interested in modern India or culture take another class.</comment>This class is very interesting but deals with a lot of very different and sometimes complex topics. It definitely helps to have a background in Indian religion to succeed in this course</comment>It is a really fun class until the very end when there is suddenly a huge amount of work. It turns out to be pretty rewarding though, and Diana Eck is amazing.</comment>the professor is incredible! such an interesting and complex topic to study for a semester</comment>Do the readings! They were very interesting and helped a lot with the class/made lectures much more fruitful.</comment>Take the class if you want a basic idea of what the most popular religions in the Indian sub-continent involve. However, the class doesn't delve deeply into the subjects, so you won't gain a lot of information about a particular religion, but you will definitely be able to hold an intelligent conversation about the religions addressed in this class once you're done! So if this works for you - take the class!</comment>For anyone who wants an overview of the traditions of India, this course is your choice.  It's a good academic exercise to explore some Indian texts and traditions, but the course is not of purely intellectual value; the 2014 iteration of the course made some parallels to modern America (which is the focus of Professor Eck's spring course), but there is a lot you can do outside of lecture to think on your own about the implications of what you are learning for the US and the world today.</comment>Honestly, I didn't like the course very much. However, the readings were very interesting. Shop it and if you don't find it interesting, don't expect it to be better as the semester progresses.</comment>This class, though relatively fast-paced is extremely rewarding and covers vast amounts of material. It provides a foundation for beginning to understand several great world religions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, and Islam. Professor Eck is incredibly knowledgeable, engaging, and exceedingly kind. I did not find it necessary to do all of the readings if you attend lecture and take thorough notes. The combination of a term paper and a final exam is somewhat daunting, but the term paper is a good exercise before the final exam.</comment>This was my favorite class of the semester. I cannot recommend it highly enough.

Diana Eck is simply earth-shattering.  Her lectures could be transcribed and sold as poetry. Her fashion game is on-point.  She knows more than I could ever hope to encounter. She has moved me to consider Comparative Study of Religion because she makes every word so enticing. 

The coursework is riveting.  I started researching for my term paper a month ahead of time because I ENJOYED it and because this class inspired me.

Some things to know for the wary course-chooser are that the reading oscillates between being totally simple (maybe 40 pages for the whole week) to very very heavy (the entire 400-page Mahabharata in one week plus additional readings).  If you are taking this class I assume you have good reading skills and while it is a bit of a burden in the heavy weeks it is still so worthwhile.

One should note that the assignments during the term are quite easy.  Weekly short responses in the section forum and three 4 page essays throughout the term. However, this class does have both a term paper and a final exam which consists of two essays and an identification section.  In terms of the courseload for the term, it is only reading, but when it comes to reading period and exams it is a bit heavy.</comment>If you have an interest in learning more about the religions of India, this would be a good class for you. It does not go into great depth on any one of the religions, but does a superb job of covering each of the religions and comparing their traditions, rituals, and modern practice.</comment>This is a great class for someone who wants to learn about the origins of religion in India. Professor Eck is a wonderful lecturer who is a leader in her field, so take advantage of having her if you take this course!</comment></course>FRENCH Aa: Beginning French I: French Identity through Visual Media</title>This class is worth it if you put in effort to work on pronunciation, listening, reading, and writing.</comment>Yes! I was able to learn so much french in such a short amount of time. It is a very rewarding feeling to come out of a semester with the feeling that I can now speak a new language.</comment>This class is really time consuming and can have a lot of work at times. I had a really hard time with the class the first couple of weeks and had no idea what the TF was saying. However, if you put in the time and do the work, you will learn a great deal of French. Although this class met every day, I really enjoyed sections because it was very interactive. This class is also great because it teaches you a lot about French culture, not just the language. They teach you in a variety of ways-through music, videos, readings, poems, comics, paintings and more! Even though this class is really time consuming and can feel overwhelming at times, it was worth it and really teaches you a lot. If you are at all interested in French, I would recommend the class, just be prepared to put in the time.</comment>You do learn quite quickly, though the work will be quite regular.</comment>This class is a lot of fun and very effective if you are interested in the language and want to obtain some fluency!</comment>You learn French very quickly but it is very difficult and a lot of outside work is required.</comment>The class was very fun, engaging, and really made me interested in the language and the culture.</comment>Great class. Mme. Mills was a great teacher. It's every day but classes are lively and mostly about verbal practice. They often include discussion with one's classmates or films. Keep on it and you should do fine in writing and oral exams, though I can't say whether it is truly a far barrier to get an A. Personally, I have been working somewhat hard and going outside of the class materials on multiple occasions but don't know exactly where I fall. But more importantly, you learn a good deal of how to begin speaking while enjoying it along the way. Overall, I would recommend with enthusiasm if one is interested in learning French during college.</comment>This course was definitely my favorite course my freshmen year.</comment>This is a wonderful opportunity to fully absorb yourself in the french language!</comment>This class is a wonderful introductory course to French. It will definitely be challenging because you often cover much material in one class, but it is super organized and therefore possible to follow along. It is also important that you do not fall behind in the homeworks because it will be difficult to catch up, but Cornardeau was always available and eager to help.</comment>This is a pretty good intro to French class, but be prepared to be a bit confused for the first if you don't know any French because the entire class is taught in French which I know was a struggle for me at the beginning. The class does go pretty fast but the assignments aren't too hard and you get to do revisions on your compositions which is great. Definitely speak up in class. This will help you once you get to the oral exams.</comment>The class is very effective at teaching French, but don't expect to be thrilled about your grade. Spelling, accents, and negligible mistakes will drop your grade quite a bit, even if they are just in doing so.</comment>If you want to learn french this is a great class for it</comment>This is a great course to take if you're looking to become conversant in french at a beginning level.</comment>It's a tough class but it definitely helps you learn the language. There is not an incredible amount of work but make sure to do the homework and study every day so that the quizzes don't sneak up on you.</comment>Mme Mills is a highly effective instructor and knows how to run a fun and engaging section. She's diligent with returning assignments and spends time and effort to help you improve, be it with exams or oral presentations. As for the class structure, the compositions and blogs can feel challenging if you don't care to be creative, but I personally enjoyed them as a unique way to engage with the language. This is what an ideal beginning language class should be in my opinion, challenging but achievable and rewarding. There are expectations that you will do more than rote memorization, so it isn't the easiest way to fulfill the language requirement. However, if you manage your time wisely and put enough effort into compositions and studying for exams, you will make great progress in French and enjoy the class. And section with Mme Mills!</comment>This course was such a positive fun space to learn!</comment>If you are interested in French at all, take this class.  And get Mme. Mills!</comment>Definitely take this course if you want a solid foundation in French. It is not too hard and you learn a lot in a short amount of time.</comment>This class is a manageable way to fulfill a language requirement.</comment>French Aa is a great start to French. All of the TFs (seem very passionate. Just remember to not be afraid to speak in class and get as much practice as possible. Office hours and language tables are also great resources that are heavily underutilized, so you get a lot of personal attention.</comment>This is a fantastic course that will turn you into a total Francophile if you're not one already. Be prepared to work on French every day or you won't get as much out of the class. You will be impressed and excited by how much you learn by the end of the semester!</comment>The TF you get really makes a difference.</comment>This class is not easy but you will learn a surprising amount of French. Try to get Jonathan Solarte as your section leader! He is incredibly enthusiastic and a fun guy to see every day.</comment>This is a great option for a language class because while it requires work and effort, the classes are entertaining and fun.</comment>It's a good course if you have the time to focus on it. For someone with no foreign language experience it was pretty difficult. Overall it is a pretty good course though</comment>This course moves quite quickly. After just a few months, we were writing 300 word compositions entirely in French and holding 5 minute conversations in the language with the TA. They can be quite picky about grammar and spelling, but it makes students more disciplined. Be prepared to put in extra time to actually learn the material and grammar rules, because a lot of the material is not thoroughly taught during class hours, but rather is supplemented with interactive learning. The course made me feel fairly proficient, which is really cool! After a semester, I can hold small conversations with francophones!</comment>Class is almost exclusively taught in French</comment>Perhaps I didn't enjoy this class because I wouldn't have enjoyed any Aa level language course, but the design of the class detracts from the learning experience. We learn about random unrelated french things that don't substantially contribute to your knowledge of the culture, which actually impairs your ability to learn applicable and useful french. I enjoyed learning the language, I did not like the class.</comment>Great language class for beginners!</comment>If you have any interest in learning French, or another language (which you should), do it at Harvard. I avoided language classes like the plague for my first two years because I hated similar classes in high school. They couldn't be more different in college. Professor Mills is amazing, and you should try to be in her section if you can.</comment>Take Mme. Mills' class.</comment>Great class, great structure, do the homework's each night and stay on top of vocab.</comment>Madame Mills is a wonderful preceptor. She encourages participation in class and gives feedback on written assignments very quickly. Because it is a beginning French course, the material is time-intensive because it requires repetition and application until you have a solid foundation in French.</comment>Come with enthusiasm about the culture, good habits, and tenacity to practice. What you put in is for you--you'll get more out of it. So ideally have an attitude of going beyond the syllabus. Also, attend some of the many francophone extracurricular available on campus and practice "in the world" as much as possible. Change devoir to vouloir!</comment>If you get involved and take advantage of class time, you will be amazed how much you progress through the course</comment>This is an excellent introduction to French, and I would recommend it to anyone looking to try something new. Take it if you eventually want to learn French! The opportunity to learn a language in such a supportive setting will likely not come after college. Assignments are not always easy, but are manageable and help you improve--they generally do not feel like busy work.</comment>This course is a good introduction to the French language. The small class size and passionate teaching staff make it a valuable addition to any education.</comment>I have advanced at a pace I could not have imagined when I enrolled in the course. I was amazed when I realized that about one month into the school year, at the midterm, I was able to talk in French for 10 minutes for the oral portion of the test. When I thought back and realized where I began and what I am capable of now, I was very excited.</comment>Take the section with Jonathan Solarte</comment>Answer in full sentences.</comment>French is a worthwhile language to learn because of its immense use around the world. Harvard does a very good job emerging all of its French students into the language and culture, and if you are prepared to work, you will get a lot out of this course.</comment>This class is really what you put into it. If you really practice speaking and learn vocabulary that is assigned you'll be amazed by how much French you can learn.</comment>Make sure you really want to learn french, because they teach it to you pretty quickly. It's not a ton of homework, but to do well on tests you have to study hard every day.</comment>Its fine. Probably a better experiance if you want to learn french rather than being forced to due to requirements</comment>This class is a fantastic way to fulfill your language requirement.  It is fun and not monotonous at all.  Additionally, you learn an incredible amount very quickly, which is really rewarding.  Also, Mme Mills is soo incredibly nice and supportive.</comment>It's very rewarding to start the class not being able to say anything in French, and end up being able to carry on a conversation in French!</comment>A good way to fulfil language requirement. A lot of busy work but you'll find that with beginner any language class.</comment>You learn much more than just how to speak French in French Aa. This course has a very interesting emphasis on the creation of the individual from language. I think a lot about inconsistencies in English now because I took French Aa.</comment>Be open to learning French in a unique and challenging way and be prepared to be expected to perform at levels you wouldn't expect yourself to be able to.</comment>If you'd like to learn French, take this class. In just one semester, you gain all of the skills necessary to write and converse basically in French. It's amazing, actually. The course does require a lot of work and a lot of class time, but it's certainly worth it if you'd like to learn French. Mme Mills is a greatly helpful teacher, too. Get into her section!</comment>French is such a fun language to learn. If you take this class and frankly any language class at Harvard, I recommend going to the Language Tutoring Center on a regular basis.</comment></course>HIST 13b: The History of International Organizations</title>This is a very interesting course, but it can at times seem unfocused, and loses out on some of the nuances of the subject through its broad focus. The discussions are also very moderated, which can hamper the free flow of dialogue at times. Overall though, it is a good course that allows you to pursue your own research in an interesting field.</comment>This was one of the better seminars I have had at Harvard. The subject matter was very interesting, and class discussions were always engaging. Heidi is a great seminar leader and really takes time to get to know her students. The final paper may seem daunting, but it is structured so that each week's blog assignment contributes to the final product, and constructive feedback is provided throughout the process.</comment>This class provides a wide-ranging but not very involved survey of issues surrounding international organizations. Discussions in class were not very engaging and did not help me learn. The final paper was a good assignment, and Heidi and Charles helped me develop an interesting project, but my paper was graded far too leniently. This course is interesting, but superficial and not rigorous enough.</comment>Take this course!! Professor Tworek is amazing!</comment>This class has been one of the best classes I've taken at Harvard. It required a lot of work, but was very rewarding. Discussion was always engaging, and it was the fastest-passing 2 hour class I have experienced! I thought the course was structured extremely well. The syllabus was more thematic than based off of individual organizations, but we learned about many individual organizations through the students' papers. Heidi and Charles were great, both in creating a comfortable and fun learning environment, and also in helping us through the writing process. If you're considering this class, I highly recommend it!</comment>This seminar is perfect for prospective history concentrators who would like to learn more about the department's expectations for written work, or for any student passionate about conducting research on a topic of their choosing. Be aware, however, that the independent research essay is the central component of this class, so you may not learn as much about international institutions as you would like, and the reading is heavy (some weeks you only have to tackle an academic article or three, but other weeks you will have to read entire books) but these readings not as fluidly integrated into course discussions as would be ideal. Still, you will definitely learn all the skills you need to write an epic research paper! 

Professor Tworek is a great seminar discussion leader with a positive attitude and genuine commitment to her students whose knowledge of international institutions is peerless, and Charles, this class's exclusive writing fellow and TF, offers excellent feedback on your written work and is a very accessible.</comment>The discussions were invigorating. The readings were easy to skim, and even if you didn't do all the readings very closely for the week, you could still participate in discussion. The final paper was so fun to write: the length was relatively short in comparison to other social science classes, and the support given by Heidi and Charles is invaluable. 100% recommend this class to any History student for their seminar requirement.</comment>This course prepared me very well for historical research and gave me the opportunity to do a rigorous study of an important issue within the umbrella of my Social Studies focus field. However, the focus of the course is very much the term paper, to the detriment of all other subject matter of the course.</comment></course>MCB 169: Molecular and Cellular Immunology</title>This course is great, apart from the fact that there are literally four grades in it: midterm, final, a single problem set (which we were first told would be posted "soon" around the middle of the semester; after being told "soon" several more times, it eventually went up just before reading period), and section participation. Prof Pillai's lectures are awesome (and poetic), and the TFs put up really painstaking and detailed lecture summaries that were much more helpful than my own notes (although they sometimes took a couple weeks to go up). The only major problem with the course is that it's really easy to get to the midterm without realizing just how much you don't know, since there's literally nothing you have to hand in before it.</comment>This course is excellent, and Shiv is a great teacher. Be careful of the grad students making it less accessible, though.</comment>Pillai is the best lecturer you will have at Harvard! He is truly gifted in delivering information while engaging his audience. The material can become overwhelming if you don't review weekly. Otherwise, the material is very straightforward and workload is very low. That being said, you should only take this course if you're seriously interested in biology or medical school, as some material can be quite esoteric.</comment>A useful survey course of immunology, but marred by an unfortunate culture of memorization. There may be an element of learning to speak the "language" involved, but that could be treated better.</comment>This was the best MCB class I've taken to date (and I'm a senior who has taken most MCB classes). This class will give you a basic introduction to immunology which will be useful to you no matter what field of biology you go into. Shiv is also a really fun lecturer and super accessible. I really appreciated that he went into the trouble to try and learn people's names and his poems were a highpoint of every class.</comment>This class requires A LOT of memorization and be prepared to have to regurgitate knowledge on the exam. I think it was incredibly difficult to have to memorize all these pathways, and in an effort to focus on concepts I would often miss certain small details that came up on exams. Shiv is a great lecturer, but honestly, this class could use more conceptual application rather than the brute memorization that is required of it.</comment>A one of a kind course! This course decodes the fundamentals of Immunology through story telling and raps- all performed by the professor himself!</comment>Shiv is definitely one of the best Profs that have taught me. Shiv's simplification of an otherwise complex subject like immunology is the main strength of this course. Summarising each topic with a poem also made it quite interesting. You will have the opportunity to discuss some seminal immunology paper, which is very good if you're really interested in a research career. The mid-term test, problem sets and  exam were very easy (That might not be a strength if you are not concerned about grades).</comment>This course is absolutely fantastic. The information is very relevant and affording s theater understanding on very current topics in immunology in addition to a thorough understanding of how your basic immune system works. To boot, the professor concluded each lecture with a limerick to summarize the topics in a silly and light-hearted manner.</comment>Shiv is an amazing lecturer.</comment>I really liked this class and thought the topic was so interesting. Professor Pillai is the best lecturer I've had at Harvard. He started every class with a relevant story and ends with a poem he wrote about the topic of the day. He is patient with questions, learns his students' names, and is inspiringly knowledgeable on the subject. In lectures he tells you everything you need to know for assignments/exams, however I highly recommend looking at the book (online @Hollis) for the diagrams.  The class was more detail oriented than I expected and there will be a lot to memorize. The section component is pretty easy: you read a short-mid length paper every week that pertains to class. Sometimes the papers are older and it's pretty cool to see how the relatively young field developed and what is left to be discovered.</comment>Super great class, amazing instructor, very interesting material. Make sure to reread lecture notes, because lectures do go pretty fast and you usually miss stuff (and exam grades are a very sizable portion of your final grade)</comment>One of the best basic immunology course</comment>a very good learning experience</comment>Try your best to get into a section that is all undergraduate students if you are an undergraduate, otherwise you will have significantly less section time devoted to review of lecture material! (Grace, if she is still a TF next year, is a lifesaver.) This class is one of the hardest I've ever taken, not because of the workload per se, but because of the amount of extremely detailed memorization and deep conceptual understanding you have to have to do well, especially given the lack of practice questions and materials. That being said, Shiv is an amazing lecturer, and the subject itself is truly fascinating. You will learn so much! I am definitely glad I challenged myself, but wow it was a challenge.</comment>If you are interested in Medicine or Bioscience then you definitely should take this course! AMAZING!</comment>If you have any interest in the cellular basis of and pathways important to immunology, just take this course. It isn't particularly difficult, TFs post lecture notes, and Pillai is an excellent lecturer.  The only week to week work is reading a scientific paper for section, which is interesting, and super helpful if you don't have much experience in reading papers. Only 1 Pset the entire semester. What's not to love? The class is half grad students, but don't let that intimidate you. They don't bite.</comment>Immunology is an important subject to understand for anyone who is looking to join the medical field. There is no better teacher than Shiv to learn this information from.</comment>Probably the best immunology class ever taught. The course material is presented in a manner that people with a small biology background can still do well and understand the concepts.</comment>This is a great course. Lectures never failed to peak my curiosity and I found Shiv to be very engaging and funny. I would only suggest taking it if you're interested in a molecular and cellular approach to immunology. If you're not interested in approaching immunology from this angle, then you might get bogged down and irritated by detail. But, if you do find this sort of biology intriguing, by all means, sign up!</comment>Take this course if you want a good introduction to immunology and haven't been exposed to it in much detail.</comment>Great class with great lectures. The rest of the class is poorly organized with regards to materials showing up online in a timely fashion (so don't miss lecture I guess), and communication about homework assignments (was assigned a last-minute problem set worth 30% of the grade over Thanksgiving and reading period where solutions were not posted until the day before the final).</comment>Shiv is a great teacher and a wealth of knowledge, it is not too taxing but you will learn a lot.</comment>All I need to say is that this course is by far the best biology class I have taken.</comment>Absolutely fantastic class!! Take it!</comment>covers core of immunology</comment>if you are interested in immunology, even a little bit, prof pillai's class is the one to take</comment>Wouldnt hesitate to recommend this course. As an introductory immunology class, it goes above and beyond in a good way!!</comment>Dr. Pillai is absolutely incredible, and you are truly missing out if you do not take the opportunity to learn from him. Grace is an incredible TF.</comment>The material is interesting and Shiv makes the lectures a lot of fun... However, be warned - there are very few grades in this class, a lot of material and not too many resources to practice for the midterm/final so that can be a bit tricky...</comment></course>EXPOS 20.262: Writing the Environment</title>This class is meant to challenge you but it does more than this. It causes you to grow and when you look back at yourself as a writer, even a debater, after a few months, it is hard to recognize yourself because you have grown so much.</comment>Martin is frank with his advice but he really wants you to improve. However, most of the work will fall on you. It's often difficult to ask for help in writing because it's independent, so don't expect that everything is given to you.</comment>The readings look interesting yet they are not ideal texts for analysis. The feedback is extremely limited and vague. The response papers and the in-class activities are not successful in getting students ready to write an essay.</comment>If you like the type of material we read (i.e. if Silent Spring interests you), the class will be a ton of fun. Otherwise, prepare yourself to slog through a lot of course material that you won't enjoy at all. Martin's a very good critic of your writing but the class is often tough to sit through on weeks where you're not particularly doing anything but working through material. Many of your essay prompts will essentially be "read/watch this. write about it." If you're okay with that lack of direction, you'll love it. If that openness frustrates you, this may not be for you.</comment>Martin will definitely improve your writing, and he really cares about you and your writing. His feedback on response papers and essays is detailed and right on the mark. Also, the trip to Walden Pond is lovely. Some of the books (especially Walden) may be a bit dry, but they are classics of environmental literature. As with almost all Expos courses, it is by no means light on work during weeks with essays and revisions, but from talking with friends, this is definitely one of the better Expos courses.</comment>One thing I realized too late is that the work can be very helpful, even if it's not graded. Take as much as you can out of the extra assignments</comment>Do not take this course unless you are absolutely interested in nature and environment. Otherwise, it will be boring.</comment>This is a basic expository course with an environmental spin. The out of classroom activities, such as the visit to Walden pond and the viewing of two documentaries were the highlights of an otherwise very basis course.</comment>The preceptor is amazing, but my experience with the class itself and assignments were sub-par.</comment>It's ok but I wouldn't put it at the top of my list. The instructor is great though, so if he does another subject I would try that.</comment>I see this class as "practice" in that you can see some places where you may need improvement in your writing, but as far as actual improvement, this class offers limited help in academic writing.</comment></course>HEB 3200: Graduate Seminar in Human Evolutionary Biology</title>Think about the articles as you read them; question what methods are being used and what is really being said.</comment>it is useful to take and provides a good introduction to HEB.</comment></course>YORUBA 101ar: Reading in Yoruba</title>Advanced Yoruba takes the skills you've acquired from previous years and engages them as you get a better grip on the language. Be sure to prepare for Theater Night early.</comment></course>VES 142: Defining Vision: Creating a Photographic Project</title>SO many great things to say about this course. It makes me sad that David Hilliard is only staying for a year - he is a GEM. Definitely the best photography professor I've ever had. He's approachable, enthusiastic, and an amazing lecturer. Ryan, too, is so knowledgable and helpful and accessible. The class environment was always fun, funny, and supportive. Everyone was helpful in giving suggestions in feedback, but the course allowed for full creative control of a semester-long project. Absolutely nothing bad to say about this course.</comment>This class was probably my favorite I've taken here. I don't know if you can take it with the same instructors, but the structure of the course and the theme of creating a photographic project is extremely helpful for understanding how you want to go forward with your work to create something meaningful and (almost) complete.</comment>Take advantage of the film cameras offered. This might be your last chance to shoot medium format film ever! You need to be able to use a camera and be willing to spend a lot of time on this course.</comment>TAKE THIS CLASS TAKE THIS CLASS TAKE THIS CLASS TAKE THIS CLASS TAKE THIS CLASS.  David and Ryan are amazing. They care and push you to be the best artist you can be. Plus they take expose you to amazing new talent by bringing you to author talks. Take the class. Its one of my top 5 best classes at Harvard.</comment>it obviously varies according to who teaches it; David and Ryan are wonderful and if there is an opportunity to take this course with them teaching it again it's not to be missed.</comment>Great class if you are looking to take your photography beyond just the aesthetic component. If you want to bring meaning, thought and depth into photography, then take this class. If you are more into just how cool your pictures are going to look, this class will be a hard class to complete well.</comment></course>FRENCH 280: Lightness and Energy: the 21st Century French Fiction</title>This class was great. It definitely took a strong background in French, but I learned a lot. Professor Bouju was so wonderful - he was always willing and available to meet outside of class, and he was encouraging, helpful, and considerate. I really cannot say enough positive things about him. The class itself was hard, but it was rewarding. We read a lot, and some of the books I liked more than others, but I always appreciated the book following the class even if I didn't before.</comment>This was definitely one of my favorite classes I have taken at Harvard .the literature was so interesting, and the class style was what I dream all Harvard classes would be like- small, round table discussions with the professor and other passionate students. Definitely take notes when you are reading the books and even take notes all on a separate sheet of paper with page numbers written down of good excerpts so that during discussion you are quick to comment.</comment>The books will be a bit daunting at first, but the discussions about them will shed a lot of light!</comment>The class is great, especially if you're someone interested in but skeptical of contemporary literature; this class opens your eyes to its richness and accomplishments.</comment>This is a fabulous course that explores contemporary French literature; discussion is very engaging and the ideas are interesting. You should have an interest in doing close reading texts and interpretation.</comment></course>ENG-SCI 51: Computer-Aided Machine Design</title>cool class! It's all real. You apply what you learn</comment>good class and should get better with time</comment>This is a really fun course. You will get to use a CNC milling machine, a laser cutter, learn how to cut and drill holes in metal, how to design things on a 3-D design software, and 3-D print some of your designs. At the end of the course, you get to design and build a robot with which you will compete with other teams. It was amazing seeing all the pieces of the course coming together in this final project.   You do need to know some physics for this class, but it isn't something you can't easily pick up if you really haven't taken it before and have taken pre-calculus. I would ask the staff for a list of topics you should review before they apply these concepts in class so you know where people are getting the answers from.</comment>I would say it can be a lot of fun, but it depends on how good/nice your team is and you will have to do a lot on your own. Can be a time drain.</comment>I would stress to future students that this class provides a great introduction to the field of mechanical engineering and mechanical design, and provides a unique experience as it if often taken by students outside of the engineering concentrations.</comment>I feel the goal of this course is the final project, which was a lot of fun (but a lot of work as well). This course also gives you a good overview of the aspects in engineering design.</comment>Awesome class, you learn lots of important basic engineering things and get exposed to many machines. You also learn SolidWorks which is so useful, so make a point of learning it. The staff is amazing and its not incredibly time consuming.</comment>It's a solid class--may not be the most exciting, but as far as intro engineering requirements go, it's pretty decent. Not too much work, very manageable, and easy to do well as long as you care. Not a bad gen ed either.</comment>ES 51 is a great engineering course with excellent teaching staff and lots of hands-on lab work. The theory/lecture is well-taught and the teaching staff is available for office hours/willing to answer questions about problem sets and lab. You'll learn a lot in lab sections about how to operate the different machines in the undergraduate teaching labs and about designing parts/assemblies. Office hours are extremely helpful, and the undergraduate teaching lab staff is great.</comment>You'll definitely have lots of fun in the labs, learning great skills like laser cutting, drilling, CNC milling, and 3D printing.  Lectures will be a tad boring at times, but these are essential for the exams.  Be warned, although it is an engineering course there is a significant amount of qualitative work since this is more of a design class, while the quantitative aspect is quite dumbed down (perhaps a bit too much) to basic algebra.  Daniela and Donal are great, I think it's mainly just the class that's still in the process of improving (for instance, this was the first year they did Turf Wars as the final project, so things will probably change in the future).  Also, although the projects are done in teams, be sure to contribute your fair share, since a decent portion of the grade is based on individual performance.  Overall, class was all right, not amazing but not too bad.</comment>If you like making things or have an inclination towards math and science I recommend the class. The PSETs take a while, but the labs are basically arts and crafts that use math.</comment>This class is a good introduction to mechanical engineering and a good way to make sure that you want to do mechanical engineering.</comment>ES51 is an amazing, hands on crash course on what it is like to be an engineer in the real world. If you are undecided and curious about mechanical engineering, let this course decide for you. You will either fall in love with the subject and develop necessary skills for the rest of your life, or you will realize it is not for you and had an amazing semester working with other brilliant people and have a good overall understanding of the design process. Crucial for innovators and people looking to develop skills to fabricate ideas into reality. Intimately integrated with the undergraduate teaching labs to create a comprehensive engineering design experience. Machine shop and lab after hours access a plus.</comment>If you think you want to be a mechanical engineer, take this course, because by the end you'll know for sure either way</comment>This class is incredible simply because of the final project. The class itself isn't the best right now, and it will likely be improved in the future, but the enormous amount of time I spent on the project was extremely enjoyable and very valuable.</comment>The lectures and classes are not great but the design portion of the course is fun and interesting.</comment>Diffficulty: 3.5/5. It is a great class. A lot of work, but very worth it. Simple is the key in the final project.</comment>ES51 is a very time consuming class, but also a very fun one.</comment>ES51 is an excellent course for people who like to build things and have the math skills to handle in-depth calculations. I did poorly on the problem sets and exams because my math level simply wasn't where it needed to be, but I loved the final project and if you like to make things and mess around in the machine shop this class is worth a try.</comment>This course is aimed to be equally aimed at mechanical engineering concentrators and Humanities students taking it as an elective; it does the latter too well to be good for the former.  For engineers, if you don't take it freshman year it's not a good use of your time except for the labs; for everyone else, it could be a fun course.  If you have any background in robotics, manufacturing, or college-level physics, I wouldn't recommend this course.</comment>The final project is fun, but time consuming. Other than that you can get through pretty easily with the lecture slides and Psets, exams aren't too daunting.</comment></course>MUSIC 194r: Special Topics</title>one of the best cross-concentration classes you will take at Harvard. if only there were more...</comment>I know Shakespeare can seem intimidating at times, but to those I would recommend this course all the more. No matter the level at which you enter, you will leave with a much deeper understanding for and appreciation of Shakespeare and Verdi (among others). Do not worry if you specialize in either Shakespeare or music, but not both: one will more than suffice.</comment>This is possibly the most enjoyable course I've taken. Professor Albright is a unique genius and an inspiration. If you have any interest in Shakespeare or Verdi, TAKE THIS CLASS!!!</comment>great way to learn shakespeare through music</comment>A brilliant class with a brilliant professor on how music+text+drama interact. But a very flawed seminar. Prof Albright left far too much time of the course up to presentations from the students. Perhaps the format will change next time it's offered... Also, the level of the musical conversation was very low. But it is wonderful to engage with Prof Albright's ideas.</comment>This is one of those must-take courses at Harvard. If you are interested in Shakespeare, this is the best Shakespeare course you can possibly take. If you are interested in opera, this is a great way to study opera and learn a lot about Shakespeare and the adaptations of his plays into operas. It is a fun course, and by simply reading the plays (about 1 every 2 weeks), you will have a lot to contribute in lecture (which is small) and section.</comment>Dr. Albright is kind, brilliant, quirky, and hilarious! This course provides a fun/ unique way to analyze Shakespeare. Take this course!</comment>This class covers broad thematic strokes, and is dependent on the expertise of the students who enrol. There is the opportunity to have fascinating discussions about Berlioz, Verdi, Britten, and Shakespeare, but the preparation requires effort!  Study the music carefully with the score, and bring lots of ideas to seminar, where everyone will benefit form them
Albright takes a historical approach, lectures are packed with information.</comment>sometimes lecture parts of the class are a bit dull, but albright is brilliant and has a lot to share, and is also very nice.</comment></course>EXPOS 10.009: Introduction to Expository Writing</title>This course is a great way to improve your writing in a very friendly environment. The one on one work with the preceptor was fantastic and the close of community of fellow freshman around you really allowed for a helpful workshop atmosphere.</comment>If you feel that your writing requires structure or that you or coming into college with some reservations about your writing take the course. Do not think about what other people might think of you or whether they may judge you. It'll help you!</comment>Make the most of it and use it as a chance to explore writing.</comment>You should definitely take it before you take expos</comment></course>HIST-LIT 90ba: England After Empire</title>This is an excellent class and Tim is a great professor. The class providse a fabulous and in-depth look at modern English history. If you have a question about the exact instructions of an assignment, be sure to ask, Tim is great at giving guidance and feedback.</comment>This course has a really interesting syllabus. Quality of class discussion however is very dependent on your peers, perhaps more so than on the teacher.</comment>Really good class. Tim is great and picks good books to read.</comment>Great readings, interesting discussions</comment>This is a lovely course. The reading material is fun and interesting, and you get to dive into topics like punk subculture that are outside most other courses. Reading load is very manageable, and the historical sources are fascinating.</comment></course>HIST 1061: Civilization of the High Middle Ages</title>The Middle Ages are great, and everyone should learn about them! This course has its flaws, specifically in being a tad disorganized and uneven from week to week, but it's such a wonderful subject that this matters little.</comment>This class is great because there isn't a ton of reading, and you really don't have to do the reading to come out with an okay grade. But that being said, the class is not very well organized, you are never clear what your grade is, and Professor Barak is almost impossible to reach.</comment>This is a good class, it can be a bit disorganized but the Prof is cool and the topic is pretty broad. It is a good intro to this period in history.</comment>Great professor, interesting readings/material, and fun overall.</comment>Professor Barak is really nice, and easy to approach. She is going to be a very good teacher when she hones her lecture style. You should not take this class unless you REALLY are interested in the catholic church, which I am not. I was more interested in the courtly love/knights, universities and other less religious aspects of the syllabus. Overall a nice course, not hard, but gets tough to follow/listen to when it's just a lot of talk about catholicism.</comment>Great class, great teacher</comment>I loved everything about this course! The lectures, the sections, the readings, everything was interesting and exciting. I strongly recommend this course to everyone!</comment>This class is a great survey of the high middle ages. It covers a broad variety of themes and movements of the period.</comment>This is a fabulous class. Professor Barak loves the subject matter and generates enthusiasm for it. She is also just a cool professor. Its an insight into the medieval world, and into many different elements, food, court culture, the move from feudal world to towns, the growth of universities. If you want to understand the early modern or modern world, this class is a must. you will see connections you never knew of before and get a much better understanding of how our world evolved to be.</comment>Great class! Interesting readings, very well taught. Highly recommend not only to History students but to others as well!</comment></course>HIST 88b: Medieval History and Cinema</title>TAKE THIS COURSE! Professor Kafadar is immensely easy to talk to and intellectually sharp. The films are great and largely movies that should be watched at some point in one's life. Readings and response papers are largely painless, but still engaging. Discussions are multifaceted and tend to follow student interest in the material.  Be sure to start thinking about possible topics for the long paper early;so long as you like history and film (why else would you take the class?), writing it will be immensely enjoyable as you choose your own topic</comment>This did an excellent job of developing ideas and discussion around history, what makes history, and if we can consider modern film depictions of a historical past as valid lenses into it. If you're interested in films (especially mid to late 20th century ones) and/or history this is a fantastic course to take. Kafadar does an excellent job of facilitating discussion and it was a very intellectually stimulating seminar.</comment>Take this course if you love watching movies for homework! The films chosen may be old, silent, and colorless, but their plots and theme will draw you in nonetheless. As someone who is interested in filmmaking, the discussions tailored to historical accuracy were illuminating in that they showed how film and research can come together or fall apart. The assignments are simple response papers, and it's a joy debating the films with the charismatic Professor Kafadar.</comment>I enjoyed this course so much! It was a lot of fun to watch amazing movies about history, read about them, and then discuss them in class. The professor, the TF, and the course program are all absolutely wonderful, and I strongly recommend everyone to take this class.</comment>At first glance, the two topics of the seminar--film and medieval history--seem to be inherently at odds with one another, but Professor Kafadar does a marvelous job of intertwining the two. This is a deep-thinking course. It asks you to challenge not just the films or our representations of the past, but also the discipline of history itself. The result is a serious of fast-paced, and at times heated, debates about everything form the peasant life to the use of light in the same film. That said, the research paper is very much an independent endeavor, and there is not a lot of writing or research support built into the course, which can present quite a challenge at the end.</comment>The films are very esoteric. If you do not like art house films, that will make it difficult. It is also a lot of work because most movies are at least 2 hours long, and you have about 200 pages of a reading a week, so lots of time to feel prepared. Also make sure you like the other people who are taking it, because I ended up resenting most of the seminar by the end, with the exception of Akif and Prof. Kafadar. Final paper requires a lot of time, don't leave to the very end. Would be nice if there were a little more structure.</comment>You get to watch movies for a semester and learn why they might be the best way to present history! Definitely take this course if you get a chance.</comment></course>VES 162g: Water Musics--A Dialogue of Electroacoustic Music and Moving Images</title>This course was very interesting. Both professors are geniuses. However, I am recommending it with reservations, because I'm not sure it's the best way to learn about music or film. On the flip side, it's not the best way to advance your high understanding of music of film, which was my case – I didn't feel like I was pushed very hard. This basically requires extreme amounts of self-motivation; the course doesn't give you anything, but it has a lot of stuff, you must simply find it and use it. (Essentially a microcosmic example of Harvard.)</comment>great class, have some ideas for your projects going in. Also be prepared to spend a lot of time outside of class on your projects.</comment></course>CHEM 115: Advanced Organic Chemistry: Synthesis of Complex Molecules</title>The course is fantastic and well organized, but of course also time consuming. You won't get much out of it if you can't put aside enough time, so plan your schedule accordingly.</comment>Even if you've seen synthesis before, you haven't seen it like this.</comment>This is a challenging class, but very rewarding. If you are willing to put effort in to study the material, then you will get a lot out of the class.</comment>This class is undoubtedly the most difficult class I have ever taken, but it was also one of the most rewarding. Expect to spend 20+ hours per problem set, but struggling with these problems is the most effective way to become better at retrosynthetic analysis and planning asymmetric syntheses. Prof. Myers is a great lecturer, but be prepared to be put on the spot during class.</comment>It's important to know what you're trying to get out of this course before taking it. Unless you're interested in spending a large part of your life making small molecules, taking CHEM115 may just mean putting in a whole lot of effort to develop skills that you'll forget in a few months. But if you really want to understand organic synthetic chemistry as it's actually practiced, this course will prepare you about as well as you can hope for in a classroom setting. It's definitely a beast of a course, and you should be prepared to expend a lot of mental energy on problem sets and exams, but you will learn a lot over the course of this semester. Just make sure that you have a use for that knowledge -- as Myers says at the start of the semester, taking CHEM115 is similar to taking an upper-level foreign language course, and there aren't too many native speakers of organic synthesis.</comment>Anyone who wants to learn about organic synthesis should definitely take this class, as long as they can commit a substantial amount of time to it.</comment>It is one of the most difficult but most useful class you'll ever take, if you can make it all the way through. Only take it if you're committed to working hard.</comment>This course is absolutely outstanding.  It is also hard.  That being said, as long as you are willing to commit time to it and work hard at it, you will be fine and you will learn an enormous amount of chemistry.  It was one of the best classes I've taken.</comment></course>RUSS A: Elementary Russian</title>Quick but comfortable pace. You'll be so surprised by how much you will learn by the end of the semester. Such a cool language and such effective teaching staff.</comment>My reservations about recommending this course lie only in warning potential students that learning a new language in college is a serious undertaking and if you aren't willing to put a lot of time into this class, you won't get anything out of it, and you'll get a bad grade besides. This class consumed the majority of my time this semester, and I still didn't always finish my homework. However, I've found it really rewarding and the teaching staff is fantastic.</comment>This is a fantastic entry-level language class. I wanted a language that would both challenge and interest me, and Russian has lived up to and exceeded that expectation. It requires a decent amount of work, but the vocabulary and grammar is useful from day one. The teaching is great both in class and in section, and you'll find yourself speaking and writing Russian faster than you ever thought possible.</comment>This is an amazing course if you want to learn Russian. My favorite class this semester. Prof. Clancy and Natalia Georgivna are absolutely amazing. If they're involved with this class it will be awesome.</comment>This is a difficult course. They want you to succeed and will do their best to make sure you do succeed but you're going to have to put effort into it. It's not an easy course and the language is hard to learn but the instructors are very good and always there to help.</comment>It moves quickly, but instructors are helpful and understanding</comment>You will learn Russian in this class, with a moderate amount of homework and practice outside of class. And it will be fun! The rare language class that is very enjoyable and effective.</comment>Be prepared to be challenged unlike any romance language.</comment></course>SCRB 175: Glucose: From Molecule to Society</title>Rich is amazing</comment>This is a very interesting class--you'll learn a lot, especially from doing the group project!</comment>This course was amazing. Professor Lee is the nicest professor I have had at Harvard. The course went at a perfect pace. Everyone felt comfortable asking questions both in class and in section. The atmosphere was just wonderful. The material is not difficult, not easy either but really interesting which makes everything easy to remember. TAKE THIS CLASS! I wish I could take it again it was that great.</comment>This is a great class to take. Dr. Lee is fantastic and cares so much about his students. I learned a lot about diabetes, obesity, and approaching scientific research and medicine more generally. We had great guest speakers. It wasn't an overwhelming amount of work and the expectations were fair.</comment>This is one of the best classes that I've taken at Harvard. Rich Lee is a wonderful professor that really takes the time to get to know his students (grabbing a 1:1 meal or coffee with him is required in the semester!), while really bringing forth great breadth and depth of knowledge in biology, medicine, and innovation. The lab component is minimal, relevant, and enjoyable, and the exams were both very fair and actually a really great way to "tie up" the course. Be mindful that there is a semester-long project that will require a significant time commitment, but it's actually a lot of fun and you get to receive a lot of feedback from Rich.</comment>Really great class - content itself is quite interesting and not too stressful. The atmosphere during lecture is usually on a light, low-key note. Really interesting guest lectures and patient visits. I came away with a much deeper and nuanced understanding of medicine and diabetes.</comment>SCRB 10 at least.</comment>I love this class. Rich cares so much about you and what you are learning both as a student and as a young adult who is heading into the future. A+ class. Great for understanding science and medicine in different arenas: law, business, etc.</comment>This was a fantastic class with a great overview of a variety of fields that you would not learn otherwise.</comment>A great class with a professor who truly cares about his students – he'll even "require" you to get lunch with him once! This level of dedication is truly unprecedented. The course itself is great, lectures are engaging, you get to do two labs with mice, and here's some "kick-butt" guest lectures.</comment>This class gives a wide-ranging view on the subject of diabetes - it is very interesting, and Dr Lee is absolutely amazing!</comment>Rich is great! This course is super chill and very informative. The lecture slides are very helpful.</comment>Dr. Lee is someone you want to take a class with. He is one of those professors who genuinely cares about his students. The course material is also really interesting, you learn about glucose from a variety of different perspectives (medical, society, biotech, disease). With metabolic diseases like diabetes and obesity becoming more and more of a problem in our modern world, this course is a really foundational course, for pre-meds and non-pre-meds alike. There is also a lab where you get to work with mice! Would definitely recommend.</comment>Take it if you are interested in how the science of glucose works in the body, and how the way our society is structured affects health in ways relevant to glucose (ie: diabetes and obesity). It has a hard science component, and also a more public-health oriented lens if you are interested in that. The work load was manageable for me, and I was taking another SCRB class with this one, as well as applying to graduate school. The exams are really fair as well!</comment>This class is absolutely amazing. It is the best class I have taken at Harvard, and that is all because of Rich. He is an incredible person and professor and he is really there to help us succeed - he really just wants you to learn and do well. I can't put into words how much this class has changed me - I wish there were more classes and professors like this at Harvard.</comment>This course is great for both science and non-science concentrators. Rich is an incredibly knowledgable and supportive professor, who will introduce you to the fascinating world of glucose. This is an especially relevant course considering the global obesity epidemic occurring today.</comment>Terrific class!! Rich is so enthusiastic about the subject matter and really tries to get to know everyone. Also, it's just called "Glucose" but there are so many aspects that it covers - from the basic biology through drug development and patent law. It's crazy!</comment></course>COMPSCI 109: Data Science</title>Only take this if you are very comfortable with programming and statistics, it's honestly completely self-driven and you just have to figure it out for yourself. If you can do that, it's really easy.</comment>This class is good because it is really applicable and the classification/data analysis portion was actually very interesting. Drawbacks are that psets are graded very randomly and truly depends on your tf.</comment>Really interesting material. Psets are fairly straightforward to get done but can take a lot of time (difficult, but graded leniently so it balances out). No tests, just psets and final project, which is a great setup.</comment>I learned a lot of extremely useful material (python, data manipulation, pandas library, how to make a website for the final project). However, the class was extremely frustrating because up until the final problem set the questions on the problem sets were very unclear. I spent about 3/4 of my time trying to understand the questions, and only 1/4th of my time actually answering the questions.</comment>A very fun and easy class (depending on your background) that teaches you the basic steps in order to be a data scientist. I had taken several APMTH courses and CS50 and didn't find the course very difficult. That said, if you start the problem sets early, you'll run into some problems because the staff would continually email out changes to the assignments. Piazza will be your friend and the TFs really do try to help everyone out, so it you a stuck, the answer to your problems will most likely be on Piazza. Start the final projects early because the data collection will take the most amount of time!</comment>The professors who taught the course in my year were not engaging, motivating, inspiring. Lectures were very dull, and to be honest you do not need to go to any lecture to be able to do well in the HW assignments and final project. But the topic of the course is interesting, and if you're willing to teach yourself Python and explore things on your own, then you get the most out of it, without needing great, engaging professors.</comment>This class provides a good foundation for doing data science. I think the most valuable takeaway was the final project, which includes creation of a website which I plan to show to employers. If you want to do data science or even software engineering, it's good to start building your portfolio of projects, and this class will give you one to add to the list. Make sure you get a good team you can learn from. I recommend being the second-dumbest person on your team so you're not completely overwhelmed but you're learning from your peers.</comment>The psets were horribly done. The topics are cool but the psets are structured in a way that does not teach the material. Also lectures are pretty irrelevant.</comment>This is an excellent course for anyone trying to learn Python from scratch and combine it with statistical understanding, especially of predictions.</comment>This course is awesome!</comment>The material this course offers is extremely valuable. It’s a wonderful commitment device for learning data wrangling and python’s most useful libraries (numpy, scipy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib). That said, the problem sets were often unclear and unnecessarily tedious. They did get a bit better over the course of the term – the course heads were learning – but be ready to rely heavily on piazza for clarifications and additional direction. I’m extremely thankful that I took this course. I did not know python before it and now feel extremely comfortable.  I can do so much exploratory data analysis and apply machine learning algorithms from libraries without difficulty. I must say it’s one of the most useful courses I’ve ever taken.</comment>This course should be great. The subject matter is very interesting and it is great to be able to do actual data science on real data sets. However, it is poorly structured. The lectures were pointless and very poorly taught. The homework assignments were graded almost at random. And I didn't feel like I actually learned much. I wouldn't recommend this class unless you already know you wanted to do data science and even then just to have a class on your transcript named data science.</comment>This class is really interesting -- I definitely learned a lot about how to collect data from the web and how to use it for analysis. While you do need to know how to code (CS50 is enough) you don't need to have any python knowledge to do well. The lectures are not required, but are actually very interesting if you go and pay attention. The problem sets are only every other week (which is amazing!!) but are somewhat frustrating. It's not always clear what you're supposed to do, so piazza will be your best friend. The final project is also a ton of fun and a great way to apply what you've learned on something that matters to you!</comment>To be straight to the point:
1) Lecture is irrelevant and unnecessary. I attended one lecture 3 weeks before the semester ended and counted less than 5 undergrad.
2) Problem Sets are somewhat of a mess. For example, one pset was so poorly written that piazza essentially blew up. Instead of rewriting the pset, they gave a 3 day extension. I really don't understand who thought that would be an acceptable solution to the problem.
3) This class can best be summed up as "CS people don't really learn anything about Stat in this class, and Stat people don't really learn anything about CS in this class". Class was pretty easy overall once one figured out to use pandas and python. 
4) Office hours for this class are a disaster. 1 TF for >15 students, assuming the TF actually shows up (which didn't always happen)</comment>This course has very interesting subject matter, but the course components still need to be improved. Lectures were often not very engaging, and problem sets were unnecessarily confusing and unclear. It is a highly marketable class for interviews but I would not recommend it unless you have a very clear interest in data science.</comment>This class will improve your Python skills, so it might be worthwhile for that reason. Otherwise you won't get a ton out of it.</comment>This class is excellent from a practical perspective. You get out of it what you put into it, and if you put the work in to learn not only the computer science aspects but the intuition behind the statistics, you will be ably rewarded.</comment>If they want to learn about the basics of machine learning, how to use python and strengthen their statistical knowledge, then this is the course for them. Doing the problem set is the most helpful feature in this class.</comment>Spend time on the problem sets and you'll be fine</comment>it is not particularly organized and the lectures are not particularly engaging. moreover, the lectures do not relate fully to the coursework and the problem sets. the final project is very vague and abstract as well.</comment>The Fall 2014 offering of this course was mediocre at best. The assignments were very vague (except for the very last one). For the final project, I didn't feel like we were very well prepared to perform exploratory analysis or machine learning techniques. The intuition for each step of the final project came from prior experience and logic rather than stuff we learned in class. Overall, unless Blitzstein and Pfister teach this class again, I would recommend it with reservation.</comment>The topic is absolutely relevant, and depending on the instructors the course could be (and has been) done really well. Prospective students should see videos of the current year's instructors teaching, if possible, to see if it fits them.</comment>As long as you've taken the prerequisites, this class won't be difficult. However, it's terribly organized and the problem sets take forever because you have to spend hours on Piazza for each one tracking down corrections for all the typos and poorly worded questions in the pset specs. Seriously, all the problem sets would have taken half as long to complete if an English-speaking TF had bothered to proofread them before releasing them. Lecture is wildly uninformative and honestly not really worth attending. This is one of those classes you can forget about until a couple days before each biweekly problem set is due.</comment>Some interesting topics and problem sets, but organization and materials need a lot of work.</comment>It's a good intro to data analysis in Python, with some intro machine learning techniques thrown in as well. If you have prior experience with Python, it will be really easy. The problem sets were very unclear at times though, which was very frustrating. It seemed like the course staff didn't even bother to proof read the assignments, and just answered the floods of questions after the fact on Piazza.</comment>This class is about as community college as it gets at Harvard. Some of the skills you may pick up are useful (scraping, basic ML concepts).</comment>It's a very easy class, but you're unlikely to learn a great deal.</comment>I liked this class a lot. It was a bit disorganized and the psets were often not clear, but the instructors and TF's are really nice and helpful and I really enjoyed the material.</comment>The material is extremely interesting, but I think the department is still working out kinks on how its best taught. I'm sure that the course will keep evolving to be an even better class.</comment>work on interesting psets... don't really need to go to class though.  it is good for getting familiar with pandas and data science questions.</comment>Lectures were more useful than I thought they'd be for the problem sets. I really liked what the problem sets were trying to teach. However, they weren't well written and I felt like I spent way too much to trying to understand what the question was asking. It's an okay class that can definitely be improved a lot.</comment>This is a truly great class.  It's definitely work and very challenging especially if you don't have a lot of experience with programming languages.  It is so worth it though, because you gain a specific, interesting and important skill set.  Your grade is entirely based on homework and the final project which is nice.  The homework sets and lectures don't necessarily correlate a ton.  Most of the learning is done in doing the homework.  There's lots of TFs to help with the homework.  If you have a solid computer science background this class will be a breeze.  Otherwise, it will be a great challenging class.  Worth it.</comment>Pretty interesting intro to data science. If you've had CS before, this class won't be too time consuming, but it can be tough otherwise.</comment>Probably one of the most useful classes at Harvard. Learning Python and applied statistics will change your life.</comment>Take it if you're interested in Data Science. Also one of the only classes at Harvard that teaches something practical.</comment>This class was an absolutely abomination of bad planning. There was literally zero organization, the TFs were not accessible and honestly extremely confused. No one seemed to have any idea what was going on. The problem sets could have been interesting, but ended up being tedious rearranging of dataframes. The professors were ineffective lecturers and the material presented in lecture was pretty much irrelevant to everything else in the class.</comment>It would be possible to take this course without experience in Python (I did not have experience in Python), but it is extremely difficult, and will require using outside resources to learn.</comment>This is a very cool and practical class. The problem sets are all based off interesting real-life examples and are fun to complete. Having them due every other week (with plentiful late days) certainly does make the class more manageable. Lecture can seem simple, but go anyway - it's sometimes very cool. It's very manageable without CS50 experience - just be prepared to work hard to master python in the first few weeks.</comment>From what I heard, this class was really really good last year; however, with the changing of professors, its quality dipped... I would say that it's worthwhile to take this class to learn how to manipulate data in python, which is very applicable to other classes. That being said, it wasn't the best taught course and it required a LOT of self-learning. Also, the lectures were mostly irrelevant.</comment>CS109 was almost completely a waste of time. Other than learning how to generate plots and work with dataframes in python, you don't really get much out of the class. If you want to learn about data science, you should just take STAT139/149 and CS181. The psets were fairly easy, but mostly because they were pointless.

For the final project, having both a website and a video is total overkill.</comment>Think about it carefully if you do not have stats background. You can learn a lot from this course, but it will be hard.</comment>Okay, but assignments are really buggy and the course feels half-baked at times.</comment>This class has the potential to be very beneficial. Unfortunately, this was only it's second year, and both the original first year teachers were on sabbatical. The class felt grossly short of what I expected it to be and what I had heard from first year students. There was no reason to go to class, the assignments were unintelligible, and the material we learned was heavily based on Machine Learning, even though this class is not CS181. It is not hard to get good grades, but you could learn this class in a weekend from a Python for Data Analysis O'Reiley book.

Note that I took this class with the replacement teachers, so everything I say could change when the original professors come back and teach this class for the second time.</comment>Definitely approach this class at your own risk. The homework assignments sometimes required too much "clariifcaiton" and there are a wide range of skill levels. Nevertheless the grading for the homework was extremley fair.</comment>The stuff you do in this class is objectively very, very cool. We had problem sets that had us analyzing MLB players' salaries, looking at poll results (in order to predict the midterm elections, which we had a contest for), building a good/bad wine classifier, and more. It's not a very challenging class if you have basic stat knowledge (basically the equivalent of AP stat in high school) and coding experience. The lectures are kind of boring but like I said they're more than made up for with the problem sets in which you look at real data to draw conclusions and feel like a true data scientist. Highly recommended!</comment>Good class only if the problem sets are written with more care.</comment>Be prepared to learn on your own. Start problem sets early.</comment>Take it to practice your skills on the problem sets. Data science is really really important to science, finance, and a lot of other fields. That said, the course didn't seem to be very well organized. Lectures are a waste of time.</comment>This class has high aspirational intentions, but it does not really cut it. The lectures and the homework assignments barely tie together, if at all. The homework assignments were confusing to follow, and they don't really teach you how to apply methods in data science. However, the last assignment became a little bit closer to being comprehensible. The overall problem of the course might stem from the problem of making the class general enough that students without CS and/or stat background can take it, so that it breezes over both concepts without much depth.</comment>This is a great intro to data science and the different methods it employs. You'll also realize how useful statistics and algorithms are in solving really interesting real world problems! Psets can be very time-intensive at first if you're not familiar with python/pandas.</comment>this class is great for beginners who don't have perfectly advanced cs skills and who are interested in statistics. stat 100 is good enough preparation, although be prepared to look up a few things that are related to statistical algorithms. Course graders take into account cs background</comment>What you get out of this class depends entirely on the knowledge you have coming in and the amount of time you put into the course.

If you have minimal CS experience (e.g. just CS50) then be prepared to learn a lot of Python. This is actually a really good thing, and this class is a great way to get a handle on standard Python use. However, it will take a lot of time and I'd imagine it will be frustrating as well.

If you have a decent to large amount of programming knowledge, then this class will be easy but frustrating.

In short, take this class if you have a lot of CS experience and want to put in a few hours every two weeks for an easy class, or have a small amount of CS knowledge and are ok with putting in a lot of time to learn a lot of practical computing skills.</comment>The course this year was disorganized. The lectures were not useful and over half the TFs did not host any office hours. This is completely unacceptable because for many students office hours are essential to answer lasting questions and completing the PSETs. The PSETs were often riddled with vague problems which would require constant checking on Piazza to confirm one interpretation of the problem over another.

I am also not sure why Stephanie Hicks is listed as the head TF if she  does not perform any teaching duties. If "teaching" means administrative duties like checking if PSETs are submitted and sending them off for other TFs to grade, then I guess I may stand corrected.

The content of the PSETs and the applicability of this course to real world problems are the redeeming factors of this course. I really enjoyed how the course forces you to learn python very quickly in order to tackle predictions and problems such as predicting the result of the 2014 Senate Midterm Elections. 

Biweekly PSETs took about 15-20 hours for me to complete, but I think this time could have been shaved off if provided organized resources, access to the office hours of all TFs, and if we had more instructors who actually cared about making the learning experience a fruitful one. I am sure the professors were well intended, but unfortunately the result for students has not really reflected their well intentions.</comment>Be warned that this class is a lot of meticulous work that is not necessarily very satisfying. You'll spend hours searching how to correctly enter a single line of code. Too much of your time is spent on details, and too little of it actually understanding the concepts and strategies behind data science</comment>A fun course teaching very practical and applicable skills. It is good for learning how to wrangle and clean datasets, but the statistical material is covered in a somewhat superficial manner. I would have enjoyed a greater level of rigor. It might be worth taking this and then CS 181, for greater depth on the topics covered.</comment>Pretty easy, knowing python before is a plus.</comment>Expect the homework sets to take a long time, but the questions are usually interesting and real-world applicable.  Lectures aren't always the most useful but lab (which no one went to?) was great for practical tips on how to complete the homework.  You'll definitely get a working knowledge of how to use ipython notebooks for statistical models, which I hear is practical in the real world...</comment>This class has a lot of potential to be really cool, but it's definitely not there yet. The problem with this course is that it didn't really work to build on itself, but instead felt like a lot of unrelated topics and a lot of exercise in coding in python rather than learning techniques that data scientists should be using. The material is pretty cool, but it's easily lost in the mess that is cleaning up data, but then again I guess that is a big component of data science.</comment>A great course on data science, but the lectures are not very helpful or instructive. The homework is definitely stimulating and is the main thing that teaches you the material.</comment>I'm pretty sure this class didn't teach me a single thing.  I became more aware of data science terms and the tools that exist, but that's about it.</comment>This class is a great introduction to what data science is like. You'll be able to use Python by the end of the course to work with and analyze data.</comment>Take it if you're interested in data science. Taught poorly in my opinion this year, but the professors will be different next year.</comment>Never went to class. Psets are quite badly written. Maybe if you put more work into it, it would be more useful, but otherwise it's not the best taught class.</comment>This class will teach you a lot about practical and useful techniques in data science, but the lectures were often unsatisfactory and felt irrelevant to the matter at hand. But if you're willing to teach yourself Python, then it's a class worth taking.</comment>Good class. Prepare for the final project ahead of time.</comment>A decent course, but at this point in time potentially not worth the substantial time commitment it requires.</comment></course>MCB 293: Biochemistry, Chemical and Structural Biology</title>reservations being it is really challenging</comment>Be prepared to learn a lot, not understand everything, and spend a lot of time on the problem sets.</comment>I'd recommend this course if you have an unshakeable interest in the subject matter. Because your interests will be shaken thoroughly.</comment></course>CELTIC 114: Early Irish Historical Tales</title>This is a great course! The workload is very manageable, as long as you keep up with the readings and attend lecture. In addition, the readings are very interesting, so the work is enjoyable. I would recommend this course to someone who has an interest in Irish history and culture or in folklore/mythology in general.</comment>This is a great class. You can can gain knowledge on an interesting an unfamiliar culture. Because the workload is not bad, all the assigned work is manageable and can actually get done, leading to better learning.</comment>This class is interesting and very manageable if you are engaged during lectures.</comment>This is a great class to broaden your horizons on a subject you would not have otherwise.</comment>Good intro Celtic class. Not much concrete Irish history here, unfortunately, mostly folklore. Although that is the name of the class.</comment>This class has you read a lot of great stories and can be very interesting at times. Professor O Cathasaigh is a nice, but his lectures can seem a bit long at times. Do try to do all the readings as there isn't much, and it's easy to catch up if you fall behind one week. The stories are pure gold and really fun to chat with people not in the class about.</comment>Professor O is great.</comment></course>FRSEMR 30v: Mexico: Revolution, Authoritarianism and Democracy: 100 Years</title>Because the material is not tested, I would tell students to take their time with their readings and spend more time on the readings they enjoy most, for learning's sake.</comment>Make sure to thoroughly do all of the readings for the week and take notes on them. It helps a lot in section.</comment>If you want a good history class about a nearby country with an incredible professor, take this class.</comment>This class is an incredible opportunity to learn about Mexico from a professor who is such an expert on the country. His commentary is just as valuable if not even more vital than the readings themselves.</comment>Professor Dominguez is clearly a skilled teacher, in addition to being a smart and nice human being. He knows how to run a class, both with in-class discussions and a structured syllabus. But be warned, there is a fair amount of reading (assuming you plan to do all of it). Also the course has more of a political focus than I expected at the outset.</comment>If you are at all curious about Mexico, take this course. Though there is quite a bit of reading per week, you will get used to it by the middle of the semester. Also, because this class is SAT/UNS and a seminar, it's a great way to learn and meet other freshman. Furthermore, Professor Dominguez is a great guy to get to know; he is always willing to answer questions both about the course and adjusting to life at Harvard.</comment>"I loved this class. It is evident that Dominguez puts a lot of effort into making the class enjoyable and intellectually stimulating. He's also a very nice man who cares not just about the course work, but about his students well being and their causes.</comment></course>SCI-LIVSYS 11: Molecules of Life</title>it's a good class but the grading is tough on the exams</comment>Really interesting and not too challenging, definitely worth taking</comment>I really enjoyed the material from this class. Interesting concepts that explain how our bodies operate on a daily basis.</comment>Best SLS class. I've heard it might not be offered again, which is too bad for people who haven't had the chance to take this class. Great gen-ed: easy, interesting, and pretty fun.</comment>Great class, put in the work and you will see the results.</comment>A lot of work towards the end. 10 page paper + a final is no joke. The grading is not easy either, so although the course material can be alright, getting an A is very difficult.</comment>Though the lectures are very interesting, section can often feel dull to the section activities that are not particularly exciting. Furthermore, the p-sets do not really prepare you for the exams, which are much more difficult than the homework assignments.</comment>Great class for non-science people. It's unfortunate that this class won't be offered anymore.</comment>This class was interesting but difficult at times.</comment>Do the homework, show up to lecture, the tests are graded pretty tough</comment>Take it for literarily the easiest SLS class</comment>The course is great. One of the best I have taken at Harvard. If you need to fulfill the SLS Gen. Ed. requirement, this is one of the best options. I am a Gov. concentrator, and I found the material to be accessible and worth learning.</comment>Workload is light during the week. Exams grading is very nit-picky and at times unclear. Also, class is a clicker class so going to class is mandatory.</comment>Molecules of Life is a cool introduction to the science of medicine for non-science majors.</comment>The trifecta - you'll be interested, you'll learn a lot, and it is easy.</comment>This class is a good basic science class both for those interested in science and those uninterested. Lectures are engaging and cover a wide variety of material ranging from diabetes to cancer to stem cells, though generally one lecture is spent on each topic, so you never really get an in depth understanding of the topic, but you learn just enough to feel like you are better informed about major health issues. The work load for this class is minimal compared to other science courses. It is not necessary to take AP Chem or AP Bio prior to taking this course, but it would certainly give you an advantage.</comment>Go to Office Hours early to make sure you grasp the material. However I don't know if this course will be offered again.</comment>If you're looking to fulfill an SLS gen ed, this is a fantastic way to do it. Extremely manageable work, accessible TFs, interesting and funny lectures, and you get learn a lot about how drugs work!</comment>The TF and review materials are wonderful and approachable. The material presented in the lectures is incredibly fascinating, but often the exams tested on materials that were buried in the lectures, and they were far more difficult than the tone of the courses would at first suggest. Nonetheless, the topics are very important; once you learn how to study for the course, it isn't unmanageable, and the teaching staff really is great.</comment>This is an easy class and a perfect way to fulfill the SLS Gen Ed requirement. Even though it's easy, it's also very educational, and having read evaluations about how easy the course was, I didn't expect to  learn nearly as much as I did. It's a lot of fun and the activities in section are not to be missed. The p-sets aren't very difficult and only take 3-5 hours each week. I'm not interested at all in biology, but I was extremely interested in the material we covered in class. The toughest part of the class, in my opinion, is the final paper, primarily due its length (10-12 pages) rather than its topic (which is mostly up to the individual).</comment>If it's offered again, this is a prime, prime way to fulfill SLS -- you'll actually learn something, the lectures are engaging, and the work will not take you more than an hour a week. The final project is pretty inconvenient but the fair exams make up for that.</comment>Great gened.  You learn 5 weeks of science and then apply it to very useful and interesting topics.</comment>This is a great class to get a sense of what it would be like to study medicine/science in more depth.</comment>supposed to be super easy isn't that easy</comment>Molecules of Life is a great class and I hope it continues to be offered. Lectures are fun and you get a lot out of them (David and Jon are great at making the material exciting) and the week-by-week workload is manageable with one problem set a week. There is a final project and a final, but as long as you start the final project early and write on something you're actually interested in, you will get a lot out of it.</comment>That it's going to require work if you want to do well. Each day put in a little bit, so you aren't cramming the night before a midterm.</comment>While the subject matter is interesting most of the time, there can definitely be moments where it does feel like an introductory science class. The problem sets aren't too difficult if you look over the lecture slides. Overall the class is pretty good but I would only really recommend it to someone interested in medicine and the human body.</comment>Amongst the uninspiring selection of SLS gen-eds out there, this is one of the better ones. The material is kind of interesting, but you won't need to spend much time on any of the work. This makes for a good fifth or sixth class for someone trying to get through the SLS requirement.</comment>If this class is offered again TAKE IT. It is a very interesting class for the SLS requirement and even if you have already completed it and are looking for an interesting elective that won't take up a ton of your time, this is a great one!</comment>Interesting class that is a great course for people who aren't going to concentrate in a scientific field. The professors are great and are very accommodating!</comment>Great class, you should take it!</comment>It is a lot of work for a gen-ed</comment>Well sadly it's going away after this year, but man, talk about an accessible and enjoyable learning experience in an otherwise potentially daunting topic. The lecturers are super cool and the teaching staff is very thorough about making sure you learn the week's main concepts. Highly recommended.</comment>In this class you will learn a lot and have a new understanding on a lot of things you used to take for granted.  I am actually impressed with how much science we were able to learn this semester.  That being said this is definitely not an easy GenEd.  There are psets and section every week, two midterms, a final project (10-page paper), and a final exam.  The class is hard and grading can be harsh.  That being said, you will learn a lot.  Take this class if you want to gain an understanding of the world you live in not if you want an easy GenEd.</comment>The material and homeworks are pretty easy and manageable, but the tests ask you to apply the knowledge a lot more and are pretty difficult. If you only study one thing for the test, make it the practice problems and practice test and do them more than once.</comment>Amazing class, but test grading is awful</comment>You will definitely leave with a better understanding of the medical world and how our bodies function. The professors and TFs really explain everything from the ground up and touch on interesting and controversial topics whenever possible (stem cells, birth control, marijuana & opioids, etc). Also I had never even taken bio or chem in high school let alone college and I was able to follow the lessons. Great class, really strongly recommend.</comment></course>EXPOS 10.008: Introduction to Expository Writing</title>If you are not confident about your writing skills, then this course could potentially help you acquire a level of confidence. Of course, how beneficial this course becomes for you depends on a variety of factors including how engaged you become with the readings.</comment>It is a perfect starting point if one does not have a strong writing background or is not confident about their college writing skills.</comment>If you were placed into Expos 20, I advice you to go ahead and take Expos 20. Although this course is great for pupils with no writing experience, it is unnecessary for those that do.</comment>Take expos 10 before 20 - it's worth it!</comment>It's a good course if you're placed into it. My section was mostly composed by international students, who didn't have much exposure to writing essays.</comment></course>FRSEMR 33j: Temples and Museums: Politics of Display and the Arts of South and Southeast Asia</title>This class is fun and fascinating, especially if you don't have background in this field. Professor Kim is a great lecturer and the class discussions are really interesting. I would highly recommend this class to anyone who's willing to put in the time to do the reading.</comment>Take this seminar!!! I think this particular seminar is the epitome of what the freshmen seminar at Harvard is supposed to be like. The topic of the seminar has nothing to do with what I plan on concentrating in, however I do think it has taught me how to think more critically, not just about South and Southeast Asian Art but about almost anything. You will learn a lot from this course, but you will also have a lot of fun as well.</comment>This class is a hidden gem that turned out to be one of the most informative, interesting and fun classes I have ever taken.</comment>If you are interested in South Asian culture and religion or art, architecture, or art history in general, take this seminar!! I took this class after having taken AP Art History in high school, looking for something that was more Eastern focused, rather than the Western-centric AP curriculum. I could not be happier. Professor Kim is an expert, a true professional, and a wealth of knowledge and resources who has traveled multiple times to the sites we studied, so she gives an accurate, first-hand depiction. More importantly, her passion was infectious, and she was an awesome mentor and role model as we started our first year at Harvard. The field trips were undoubtedly the highlight of this course. Take this class if for nothing else to get off campus and see some of the vibrant culture in Boston/surrounding areas! Compared to other seminars, there was a lot of reading (~50 pages a week, plus a weekly response, 1 paper, and 1 final project), but it is nothing that you can’t handle, and it is so worth it. Professor Kim is also very flexible and understanding. Though I gave this class a moderate difficulty score, it is incredibly intellectually stimulating. You will learn so much about the specific topic (South and Southeast Asian Art) and also about generalities of art, museums, and temples that any cultured person would want to know for the rest of his life!</comment></course>SCRB 130: Biomedical Entrepreneuring: Turning Ideas into Medicine</title>I learned so much about the scientific world in this class. The access to speakers, the assignment to build a startup. All of these things are daunting but well worth it.</comment>this is one of the best classes to take if you are fascinated with biotech or pharma industries. you will get a good introduction and hands on experience regarding development of biotech companies</comment>Even though this class was at 9 am on a Friday, I really enjoyed interacting with the guest lecturers. Most of them were incredibly insightful and interesting, and made waking up on a Friday worth it. Overall I would recommend the class, but I would caution to take the final project very seriously because it turns out being a lot more work than you initially anticipate.</comment>I really enjoyed this course, although there wasn't much feedback on the midyear written assignment. This course is definitely a must before graduating for any bio student who doesn't want to just be a doctor; consulting, pharma, biotech, legal work, fda regulation, and more are covered in this class.</comment>This course is an introduction to founding companies and bringing science to clinics. It doesn't really get down into the nitty-gritty details of how to do this, but the guest lecturers are great and are the tops in their fields.</comment>This class is great! It is project-based, with no other assignments, so you have to be prepared to work intensively on one idea for the entire semester. The speakers are interesting and impressive leaders in the field. The workload is relatively low, as long as you make sure to stay on top of the project and not leave it until the very end. I definitely recommend this class!</comment>This class has great speakers and is a great opportunity to take a science course that is truly integrative and applicable to real life!</comment></course>MATH 23a: Linear Algebra and Real Analysis I</title>This is a challenging course but worthwhile, struggling through the psets is frustrating at times but figuring things out is very fulfilling.</comment>Just be aware of the high workload.</comment>While the material taught in this class is extremely valuable for applications in other subjects (for example economics and statistics), the way this class is taught is not too helpful in grasping all of the topics as too much material is crammed into one class.</comment>It's a far more demanding class than you might expect, especially since there's kind of an expectation that you've already learned the material on your own before coming to lecture, but worth it if you want to see what math is really like outside of the high school bubble.</comment>It is a huge time commitment and can often be frustrating. Having done further math and higher math in the IB was of very little significance to the course. If taken with less demanding courses, you should find an ability to grasp the material but even so, there is much room for improvement.</comment>I didn't really learn anything.  However, I was still able to get a pretty good grade, which shows there's something wrong with the course.  Lectures were basically useless, as you just watch Paul speed through a bunch of proofs and problems while you scribble notes furiously and process almost zero information.  Then you cram your proofs and psets in on the last day without really understanding anything, and somehow manage to memorize all of the proofs and sample problems so you get a good grade on the exams.</comment>Paul is a fun professor. He is accessible to students.</comment>Only take this class if you think you're seriously interested in math but don't have the time to commit to Math 25. I never meant for Math 23 to be my "main" class but it became that – it took me the most hours every week and caused me the most anxiety and frustration to really try to understand the material. This class requires a LOT more work than I realized to do the problem sets well and to try to grapple with the material.  The problem sets were reasonable for the most part but on top of that there are new proofs to memorize every week, and an exam every 4-5 weeks that requires a HUGE amount of time to study for. Exams required hours and hours of memorizing dozens of proofs and example problems in order to do well. I easily spent 10 or more hours on a typical week, and dozens of hours in the days leading up to exams. On the other hand, I did learn a lot of math.  If you take this class, know that you will spend many hours at office hours, but that the course staff is understanding and very helpful. Paul is also probably one of the kindest and most knowledgeable people at Harvard and really did everything he could to take student feedback into account. If you don't go to Paul's office hours at least once, you're missing out!</comment>This class provided a more comprehensive picture of math than I've ever had before without becoming too demanding. The course is very organized and the teaching staff is enthusiastic and genuinely cares about students' success. Lectures weren't always that engaging, however.</comment>The proof component of this course is very valuable and you will learn a lot thanks to it. However, I think the reliance on R scripts for lectures make the material very difficult to understand. Moreover, each Problem Set requires a LOT of work. I ended up spending my whole weekends on those having very little time for other courses. I would say: do take this class if you are into proving theorems and if you can calculate very quickly but do not combine it with too many courses with a heavy workload. Do not take that class if you are not too much into math.</comment>Please do not take this course.  The current format is extraordinarily flawed. If the course changes dramatically I might change my answer, but for right now the lectures are useless and ultimately you are teaching yourself.</comment>Don't be intimidated. Taking Math 23 over 21 was one of the best decisions I made during my freshman year, and I came in with only AP Calculus BC (in junior year, too, so I'd forgotten a lot!). The course is structured in a very logical way and it eases you into proof-based thinking, R, LaTeX, and all these other skills that are just generally useful moving forward. Problem sets can be tough, but they're perfectly doable if you go to office hours (and the CAs are pretty awesome). And quizzes are generally fair... you'll know exactly what to expect, and preparation is straightforward. You'll come out with a renewed sense of self-efficacy; you learn a lot in just one semester!</comment>Do you love math? Hoe much do you love math? A lot? A little? think carefully about these questions. This class is either for you or it's not. you probably don't want to be in it if it's not.</comment>Personally, I took this class to challenge myself while obtaining credit toward a technical concentration. I was sometimes frustrated with the proofs, and was always eager to move onward toward their applications. If you are someone who is particularly interested in theoretical math, then this class would probably be a good fit, but if you enjoy using math more as a tool to solve problems, maybe another course would be more suitable. However, Professor Bamberg was a great lecturer with some good jokes, so that aspect of the class was a plus.</comment>the r-scripts can be hard to follow, but the course material is legitimately very interesting and taught in such a way that one leaves the course having gained a profound understanding of the topics.</comment>What you get from this course really depends on the time and effort you put into your work. It is easy to get a good grade in this class if you 100% know how to do sample problems, group problems, and proofs.</comment>The "application" section of this course is not as extensive as it seems to be. Most of the mathematics in this course is theoretical, with light connections to other disciplines. Although the course may improve in preparing course material and other aspects since it was recently renovated, it should be noted that this is a moderate course in theoretical mathematics rather than a mixture of practical and theoretical mathematics.</comment>If you're looking for something more rigorous than Math 21 but only have a background in AP Calculus, this class is probably perfect for you. The first module (Linear Algebra) was a pretty big shift from high school calculus and was definitely the most difficult part of the course. However, there is a great community in the course and you will find a great group of people to study with, and when you have lots of people working together, finishing the psets isn't that bad - you really just have to sit down and do it and make time to go to office hours. Once you get used to the format of the class, learning real analysis and toplogy goes pretty smoothly (that's not to say it isn't still pretty difficult at times). One more thing - you have to be up for memorizing a LOT of proofs, especially in the real analysis module. If you want to learn how to use R and/or LaTeX, you will also be forced to learn those skills in this class!</comment>I have very mixed feelings about this course.  It's also difficult for me to judge, because this semester, the course was taught differently than usual.  Math 23a has so much potential to be great, but for me, it seemed I had to teach myself a lot of the stuff  In lecture, we would do R scripts and problems that we didn't yet understand because we hadn't learned the material.  Kate's lecture preview videos were good, but not so extensive that we could jump into the material without more of an intro.  This class definitely shows the theoretical as well as practical side of math.  Know that it is A LOT of work.  I never expected it to be that much work.  If Paul goes back to the traditional way of doing notes, it might be great.  Regardless, I don't have a big recommendation whether to take or not take this course.  I just hope that you have some idea of what you're signing up for, because I didn't.  We were the guinea pigs of a new format that did not work very well, but I've heard that his formats have worked in the past.  In terms of the order of content, the restructure worked beautifully, but for style of lectures and sections, it didn't work.</comment>Math 23a can be seen as a weird intermediary between 21 and 25, which does its job. Honestly, if there were Math 24 I would have taken it, but math 23 does a good job in integrating proof writing skills and problem solving skills. The exams may be lengthy and tedious, but it is do-able and you get a lot of preparation for it. The course material is essential in any math/science disciplines, and we learn what is useful and relevant without losing focus and depth. I would recommend this if you are not sure you want to be a math major, or are sure you want to pursue a major that uses mathematical tools.</comment>Hard, time-consuming,  you might not like the teacher that much</comment>This class is perfect if you are interested in theoretical math but proofs seem scary. This class will teach you how to do proofs without throwing you into the deep end like math 25. I would recommend reviewing sequences & series from BC calc if you have time. I didn't like Paul at first but he really grew on me. Lecture was hard to follow at first because he goes fast and there's a lot to listen to and look at but I got used to it and now I feel like I get a lot out of lecture.</comment>A difficult class, but you will learn so much math. You'll learn to love Bamberg.</comment>Lectures are not great, material is too hard to understand without good lectures.</comment>the structure of this class discouraged me from actually learning the math, as opposed to merely doing problems. i learned very little about using R for anything complex or writing proofs based on more than algebra, which were the two main things that drew me to this class</comment>Make use of the extensive course materials. They're incredibly well done. Paul is delightful also</comment>Work early and work often on P-sets and proofs. It will benefit you much in the long run.</comment>Time consuming</comment>Math 23A is a very challenging and time-consuming course. For students who aren't interested in concentrating in math but are still passionate about advanced mathematical theory, I would caution you from jumping into this course. Many times throughout the course of this semester, I considered dropping the course because it was so time and labor intensive. Problem sets take a very long time, although they are very edifying and rewarding upon completion. If you are willing to put in the hours though, this class is really not as bad as people may describe it to be. The course staff are all incredibly supportive and they will do whatever they can to help you understand the material.</comment>This class definitely requires some mental organization outside of class, figuring out how to handle the format of the class, but with friends in the class, it becomes reasonably enjoyable, and I feel like I definitely learned in the class and have more confidence dealing with proofs.</comment>You will cover a lot of material at a quick pace, but not super in depth. You will learn about many different topics, but sometimes they will seem disjointed. There is quite a bit of memorizing proofs and proof strategies, which many people tend to find difficult, especially if they haven't had experience with proofs.</comment>Take this class: it's hard work, but it's very rewarding. You'll come out thinking that you have learned a lot!</comment>very difficult, but there is a strong support system & definitely more online resources than comparable math courses (e.g. 25)</comment>If you just want to learn how to use multivariable calculus and linear algebra, I would suggest taking 21a/b. If you have a decent amount of experience with proofs, I would suggest taking 25a. Both of these courses are taught much more effectively than 23a, and I get the feeling from my peers that they understand the material much more thoroughly. It's not that the material covered in 23a is bad, it's just that it is presented very unsuccessfully (I found Paul's lectures unhelpful, especially due to his use of the programming language R to do in-class examples.) The class relies on a lot of memorization of proofs and recipes rather than requiring you to understand the concepts. I would only suggest 23a if you really want a basic introduction to proofs and are willing to forgo better teaching for that sake.</comment>It tries to provide a compromise between the rigorous proof of 25 and the mechanical computation of 21. In doing so, it shoots itself in the foot: you don't engage deeply with either proof or method. Having said that, you get out what you put in. If you put the work in, I'm sure you can learn a lot.</comment>It was a chill course without too much time commitment, but I did not particularly enjoy the structure of the class, and thus did not physically go to the class after the first week. I would have loved to take Math 25a if professor Gross was teaching; if you're contemplating between this and 25a, definitely go for 25a...</comment>The course may at times seem to be rather haphazard, but by the end of the term it has come together rather nicely.</comment>Abandon hope all ye who enter here</comment>The math concepts covered in this class are very interesting, but the way the course is organized is less exciting. Lectures cannot be understood unless you watch the preview videos first, and even those are quite brief. Lectures end up just being a chance for you to copy down notes to study later. One section is graded, but how this is done is extremely ambiguous. The up side is that if you have a good late section leader, you will receive excellent review of the past weeks material at the beginning of each week. Exams are quite manageable if you study the all the problems sans problem sets.</comment>This is a good class with a professor that understand what it's like to be a first year student. If you feel intimidated by the first day of class I would urge you to sit through the first week and try the first PSET. A lot of people started to feel a lot more comfortable with the pace and difficulty of the course as time went on.</comment>Read the book! By far the most helpful.</comment>Just take 21 or 25. The approach this course takes to teaching is absolutely terrible. Paul just does proofs and sample problems for the entire lecture with the assumption that you already understand the material. This would be fine if the class actually provided a way to learn the material. Instead, there are these useless "lecture preview" videos which consist of a TF reading the useless "executive summaries" that are poorly-written, confusing, and ineffective at developing intuition. There is almost no attempt made to achieve understanding of the topics, and indeed appears that even some of the TF's don't understand them (mine didn't know what a gradient was). The exams consists of rote memorization of proofs and computation strategies. Ultimately, there are serious flaws in this course's pedagogical approach that renders it entirely ineffective at what it advertises to teach. I cannot in good conscience recommend this course to anyone.</comment>I would only take this class if you are interested in proof-based mathematics but have never seen it before. Otherwise, I feel that math 21 would have been much more practical and math 25 would have been much more helpful.</comment>It's a lot of work and memorization. I definitely learned, but I'm not sure if it was worth all the effort.</comment>There are some eccentricities of Paul's teaching style and the way that the course is structured. I don't think Paul is an ineffective teacher, but I think significant changes in the way the lectures are structured really improve the class. That being said, 23 occupies a unique niche in the math department and I think there really are quite a number of students who have either seen most of the material covered in 21 but are reluctant to take 25. If you fall into this category and choose to take this class, go to office hours! Especially Kate's office hours. I often didn't feel like I had a good grasp of the material after attending lecture, but office hours really cleared up my understanding.</comment></comment>This class is time-consuming, and real analysis is just a difficult subject to wrap one's brain around.  The class can be frustrating at times, but if you're willing to put in the time, it can be pretty rewarding I guess.  Except presenting proofs, which will always and forever be terrible.</comment>If you're happy to teach yourself most or all of the material and concepts behind what we learn in class, this class would be a good fit. But, the pace of the class is very quick and the subject matter seemed random and incongruous at many times, making it difficult to feel the class was building on past knowledge. I was between taking 21 and 23 this year and wish I had taken 21 to save myself a lot of headaches over memorizing proofs and spending many many hours outside of class having to watch Khan academy videos and other professors on youtube to actually understand the material.</comment>Take Math 21a or 25a!</comment>The material in this class is extremely interesting.  Paul is a very nice man, but his voice put me straight to sleep in every single lecture.  It's not too bad if you watch him at 2x speed in the lecture videos, but be prepared to do that.  It was difficult, not so much because the material is inherently difficult, but because I had a hard time learning from Paul.  The TFs are great, though, and they are the only reason that I learned anything in this class.</comment>Paul is hilarious! If you are at all interested in knowing some of the theoretical aspects of math, or if you just want to have a very firm and comprehensive base, this class is fantastic. Paul is not a conventionally good teacher, but he is very bright and very helpful and wants to see every student succeed in his class. Don't get scared off by his first few lectures; Paul uses a lot of R scripts in his class and sometimes you might feel a little lost, but you will learn so much in this class! He goes through a ton of material and at a manageable pace. Kate's lecture are a fantastic supplement to lecture. If you are vacillating between 21/23/25, I would definitely recommend 23 as a great option; it is significantly more theoretical than 21, but provides a much lighter workload than 25, all while giving you most (if not all) of the math you would need to apply to any science or applied math concentration.</comment>I originally took this class after taking Math 25a. However, I ended up taking math 23a because there is much more in this course that supports your learning. Math 25a wasn't supported by sections and when I noticed the amount of time I would have to spend on pests (time I didn't have), I went to Math 23a. I think it was personally a smart choice because while I did still have to spend some time on HW, section reinforced learning and I was much more prepared and knowledgeable about the material after class than I was in math 25a. (Note: I have a lot of math background (calculus from a while back, lin al., diff eq,, and other classes). However, the material covered in my previous classes were done and over with in four weeks.) Harvard classes are much more in-depth, so be prepared. Also, brace yourself for real analysis…</comment>Math 23a is a really great class for getting a solid introduction to proof-based mathematics. This course is a great way to find out if you're interested in taking higher-level math; many students are enthralled and some students are turned away (though they still learn a lot from this specific course), but it's really nice to know whether this is something you're interested in before continuing too far along in the mathematics track. Students from a wide variety of mathematical backgrounds and interests take this class, so it's easy to find people to study and do psets with that are interested in the same things you are. This also means that you probably won't be at the top or bottom of this class, and you'll find people to help you when you're struggling or be able to help others when they're having difficulties. Math 23a is a great class to catch up to those who have taken higher-level or proof-based mathematics in high school, and it prepares you extremely well to continue on in any sort of math, science, or economic field you are interested in.</comment>I'll start of by saying that this course is not perfect.  It's at the kind of awkward intersection between applied math and theoretical math.  Some people like it and some people hate it.  As a result there is no general consensus of the course.  Personally I enjoyed the class.  I will tell you that it was hard and it was my heaviest workload.  But, I did feel like I learned a large amount of mathematics in the course of the semester.  In addition the course staff was very friendly and nice.  Some people may be complaining about Paul's teaching skills in this evaluation.  As most people can tell you, he has often been a very divisive lecturer at Harvard.  I really liked him and enjoyed his teaching largely due to the fact that I took the opportunity to ask him questions personally.  It is true that sometimes his explanations can be confusing because he often does not see the need to explain the thought process in between certain steps because he thinks those steps are trivial, but if you go after class or to his office hours to ask him a question about it he will gladly answer them.  Paul just really loves to teach and, unlike many other classes offered at Harvard that only give a certain amount of good grades a semester, really wants everyone to do well.  Bottom line: If you are anything like me and have taken MV calc and linear algebra in high school, but are not good enough at math to take math 25/55 than you don't have any other option besides this class.  Just get the most that you can out of it and try not to complain about what could have happened because this really was your best choice.</comment></course>SWAHILI A: Elementary Swahili</title>Awesome course, Mugane is a great teacher! Very doable with a few hours of work a week. The class is meant to teach you, not to be overly difficult. Thanks for everything!</comment>Great, low-intensity language. Professor Mugane is an awesome teacher.</comment>If you have no experience with African languages and will never take another, try Swahili. It's not that hard, and Prof. Mugane is a lot of fun. If you have any knowledge of another Bantu language, this course will be really slow and easy for you--but it will still be fun. Ask the course staff to push you and challenge you: I did, and it paid off.</comment>This Swahili class is a pretty fun (and relatively low-stress) way of learning a language! Professor Mugane is very fun to learn Swahili from- he's hilarious, but I think what really made the class great was the TF, Sarah. Professor Mugane can sometimes be unclear in lecture, but Sarah cleared up these confusions and put in so much extra effort to make sure that we understood all the concepts. She's the most hard-working TF I've ever had at Harvard! She and Professor Mugane meet often to talk about the class, and it's very clear that they both really care about the student's learning. If there's something that most of the class doesn't understand, then Sarah and Professor Mugane put the blame on themselves and then work to make sure that we understand it. I'm not sure if Sarah will be TF'ing again next fall semester- in the spring '15 semester, she's actually going to be TF'ing a different course.</comment>learn your vocab</comment>This is a really fun course that is extremely relaxed. You also learn A LOT which is a nice plus!</comment>Mugane is the man. He knows what he's doing and provides a fun and stimulating learning environment.</comment>The teaching staff is wonderful and makes you really want to learn the language. The homework and exams are directly correlated with what is going on in class, meaning no surprises. It's a great class!</comment>Swahili A with Mugane is really fun, a chill class, and a good way to familiarize yourself with East African languages. The class has very little structure - Mugane will just kinda talk and say some words in Swahili before you understand what he is actually trying to teach, but overall, the lessons are great. He also tries to teach a bit about East African/Bantu culture, which is great.</comment>It's a very fun language to learn, good for getting the language requirement out of the way.</comment></course>FRSEMR 39j: Dirty and Dangerous: Environmental Problems and Problem Environments in US History</title>Nothing that hasn't been published.</comment>It's a very interesting class, but make sure to understand it is history based (not science like I thought it would be...) Be ready to read every week and to speak up in class (which is not a bad thing, it's actually quite fun)</comment>It is an engaging and interesting seminar.</comment>It focuses on the historical view of environment. It'd be much easier/less burdensome for you to read the materials over a couple days, but Susanna is still awesome no matter what.</comment>Get ready, the class is great and the fieldtrip is fun!</comment>This course is a really great way to think deeply about the relationship between humans and their various environments throughout U.S. history. I would recommend taking this course if you like history and would like to attempt to study it through an environmental lens.</comment>This class is great for what it is - a seminar class that is graded sat/unsat - and you will take out perhaps more than you put in. If you have a general idea what you are talking about in class, you will find the discussions really thought provoking. Susanna does a marvelous job of facilitating discussions and helping unearth what you think about important issues discussed. She is definitely a left-leaning (politically) teacher, so if that bothers you be forewarned. It's possible not to lean that way and learn wonderful things though (my case)! :) She is wonderfully passionate about what she believes in!</comment></course>BIOSTAT 250: Probability Theory and Applications II</title>This course is tough but worthwhile to take. Even though I don't do very theoretical research, I found it useful to see the big picture and learn the topics presented in this class.</comment>The course is really tough, and there is a lot of class participation, so be prepared to make lots of mistakes.</comment>A strong background in analysis is necessary before taking this course.</comment>Lorenzo cold-calls people in class, which was terrifying at first but actually ended up being for the best. By the first week, every single person in the room said something that made no sense, which stripped away ego and really created a level of comfort in the class that allowed for learning. This material is very tough, and you should take advantage of Lorenzo's genuine willingness to recap things until you understand it more clearly.</comment>This is a rigorous course in measure theory involving fundamental concepts and results that are essential for understanding theoretical results in statistics.</comment></course>SPANSH Ab: Beginning Spanish II</title>This class is great, just make sure that you keep up with the vocab and grammar day by day.</comment>It was fine. Not too hard. Just kind of what you expect out of an introductory Spanish class.</comment>Great language course. Very reasonable time commitment, with fair (kinda easy) assessments.</comment>Maria is the bomb. Make jokes it makes the class more fun, and the teachers actually like it.</comment>Easy bridge between beginner spanish and a higher level. Easy review if you took a year off of spanish in high school</comment>The class is manageable and very helpful at slowly building up Spanish speaking, writing, and reading abilities. The activities about Latin American culture and history are informative and engaging.</comment>If the resources and material of this course is taken seriously, you can learn a substantial amount of spanish.  By the time this course terminated, I was able to comfortably speak in the present as well as the subjunctive, future, and conditional tenses.</comment>Spanish Ab is awesome! Even though I came into the class without having taken Spanish in high school, I quickly caught up to everyone else. Maria is an awesome teacher and taught me how to write, read, and speak Spanish with astounding fluency for only having taken one semester of it.</comment>Only take it if you have to and probably just do Spanish aa even if you know a lot of spanish.</comment>Make sure you show up to class everyday.</comment>Be prepared to attend class four days a week.</comment>Great for beginners or people who have taken spanish aa!</comment>I took like five years of spanish (middle school through like 10th grade) and forgot a lot of things, so this course was good refresher and i actually learned how to have a conversation. its a pretty chill class as long as you don't forget to do the online assignments. Also, I didn't buy the book, never ended up needing it</comment>The grammar is the most important part; Vocab is useful but if you want to do well on the exams, make an effort to study grammar.</comment>very fun and engaging, interesting as well</comment>This class will put you on the track to fluency as long as you put in the effort (speaking and actively listening in class). The teachers can grade harshly, especially the compositions, because the ultimate goal is to improve your writing (which you will). You get homework almost every night but it never feels like busy work because it adds to what you are already learning in class.</comment>The class is fairly straightforward. You will learn grammar and practice speaking in class. At times it is uninteresting, but at other times there are opportunities to talk about Latin American ideas or values which are more fun.</comment>If you need the language requirement and have some background in spanish, you won't find the course difficult. Though everyone will probably find it tedious. Definitely depends on your section leader. Maria was great</comment>This class is fine, but meeting everyday isn't great.</comment>Don't be discouraged even though there are many kids with a lot of Spanish knowledge in the class.</comment>Very fun class.  Definitely take if you are looking to enjoy your language experience.</comment>This class is pretty easy as long as you keep up with the online activities and study for the quizzes.</comment>There is a whole variety of students in the class, from those who are pretty fluent in Spanish to those who are beginners, from those who want to pursue a language citation to those who just want to fulfill the language requirement. This course is good for them all; I had four years of high school Spanish, and I felt it was a great review of all of the tenses/moods in Spanish, and I learned at least some new vocabulary. Looking forward to taking higher level courses, and hopefully I can have Celeste as a professor again- she is fantastic! Language courses are truly the best at Harvard!</comment>Its a nice and chill way to learn Spanish. Make sure that you really understand Spanish Aa's grammar though.</comment>Celeste is so nice and so good at facilitating class discussion. I really enjoyed this class and it made me want to continue studying spanish!</comment>Harder than Spanish Aa but still manageable and enjoyable. Overload of verb tenses and conjugations at the very end of the class, but overall material is well-taught and daily assignments force you to stay on top of it.</comment>For the Spanish speaker who can follow directions in Spanish, this class definitely strengthens your language skills. It is very thorough in its approach to grammar and vocabulary. Be comfortable with learning the vocabulary outside of class. Also be comfortable with speaking a great deal in class and writing a lot, as half of each quiz's grade is based on a composition. Grammar starts with the preterit and ends with the imperfect subjunctive. Overall, a very good class.</comment>This class is a very low-stress, easy class. There is constant work, but it is mostly busy work that can be done in about 30 minutes each night. If you took more than two years of Spanish in high school, I would recommend not taking this class, but rather Spanish C or another higher level course.</comment>Take this class! It is extremely easy and will really leave you with a true knowledge of the language.</comment>Spanish AB appears to directly continue Spanish AA (which I did not take).  The homework load is not bad, but it is lots of little assignments that you should write down to remember.  Marta (instructor) is the best.  She is really nice, funny, and genuinely cares for her students.  If you took a year off from Spanish before entering college, this is a great course to re-spark your memory and verb tenses.</comment>A great way to continue learning Spanish!</comment>This class will help you understand the Spanish language in a deeper way than you have before. You will be fully immersed in the language during class and you will be able to perceive a definite difference in your Spanish abilities after only a few weeks.</comment>More grammar than you'd expect, so lots of memorizing.</comment>Celeste Moreno is awesome! 

Now some advice:

~The class isn't bad at all. Just study the vocab, grammar, and pre-write your essays. Even with only knowing half the vocab, at least knowing the conjugation, and a general direction of an essay, you can score 90+ on the quizzes which I think each only counts for 1% of your grade. 

~Study for the midterm! If you don't study for the regular quizzes, the midterm will be harder. If you study for the regular quizzes, the midterm will be easy. This is mostly because the number of vocab words and grammar is a lot more for the midterm, and they are worth about half your grade.

~If you are taking a language just for the requirement, take the language proficiency exam before the class (summer or January)! Going into it, I thought college language would be more difficult than high school, and I would never pass the placement, so I might as well start as low as I could without taking the exam. If you have done AP Spanish, you will probably pass out of the language requirement. It will save you 4 hours a week in class and another 3 hours+ outside of class each week. Instead of getting up for a 9 am class four days a week, you might have your first class at noon or 1 in the afternoon with no classes on 2 of the 5 days of the week.

~Take this class if you want to learn Spanish or want a class without too much stress for your first semester of college. It is great at giving the basics, and will give you plenty of time to focus on other classes. Combine this with a seminar and you might only have 1 or 2 finals at the end of the semester. Once again, Celeste Moreno is awesome!</comment>Read the material that will be covered before you go to class. It will help A LOT as you wont be lost during class.</comment>Studying is essential, every night, even if only for half an hour. Stay in communication with your instructor and everything will be easy and straightforward.</comment>This course may be a little challenging at first if one is not comfortable speaking in spanish. However, as the year progresses each student will feel more comfortable with their spanish skills. I feel like I have learned so much in such a short period of time.</comment>this class is a really easy introduction to Spanish; take it if you want to learn basic Spanish or for your foreign language requirement.</comment>It's pretty easy. Just take it if you want to learn Spanish because as much as it is easy, it is also effective at teaching Spanish.</comment>Always check for homework online, and don't forget to make corrections after initial submissions.</comment></course>SCI-LIVSYS 26: The Toll of Infection: Understanding Disease in Scientific, Social, and Cultural Contexts</title>This was an amazing class. The teaching staff all work raelly hard to be engaging and to present the material in interesting ways. Sections were actually great and added to the class in a way that most sections don't. There was a ton of reading but I didn't do most of it and still got a lot out of the class.</comment>A great way to fulfill SLS! The teaching staff is some of the most enthusiastic you'll ever see, and the professors have a long line of experience in health fields. It's a great survey of all the major diseases and their impacts on society. Sometimes it can get a bit bogged down in the science (without much motivation to remember it since the basic science is only tested in open notebook quizzes) but usually the material is engaging and interesting. Plenty of guest lecturers too! Section is great and fun, the TF's are amazing, and you'll look forward to it! My only major complaint is that the reading assignments were extremely variable in length and sometimes felt unfocused or completely unnecessary.</comment>Hard to take the class seriously</comment>The teaching staff are AMAZING and you should definitely take this course!!!</comment>helpful to have science/medicine background but not necessary. you are expected to be engaged and interested in the material and participation is necessary</comment>Heads up for a lot more science than you might have thought</comment>This class was everything that a humanities concentrator would want out of a science class. At moments, I felt myself leaning towards premed again but was always well supported by the teaching staff for not being premed. They truly welcomed individuals from all backgrounds, concentrations, and points of view.</comment>This course has good material, but the teaching is hit-or-miss. Don's a good lecturer, but not everyone is quite so great.</comment>Despite being a fairly new course, this class is very well-structured, with a highly knowledgeable and accessible teaching staff and a well-chosen, though vast, set of readings and materials. Though occasionally quite challenging in the area of the science studied, this class is great at providing you with the support you need, and encouraging you to appreciate how amazing the material is. This class has a lot of guest lecturers, all of which who bring diverse and fascinating perspectives to the material; it was wonderful, for example, to listen to Dr. Richard Cash lecture on his experiences developing ORS in Bangladesh.</comment>The science portion of the course is great, but although the professors are very enthusiastic they have problems teaching the humanities/social science aspect of it. The science is also fairly difficult, not sure I would take it without some sort of background in science - I did not have any background and found it hard going for the first few weeks.</comment>really interesting, engaging, and fun. plus excellent teaching staff.</comment>This class was a little disorganized, which makes sense seeing as this was the first year. I still had a lot of fun, though. I think tailoring the objectives of the course to maybe include a little less science and more humanities or finding some way to construct the curriculum to establish a clearer pattern of how the scientific element affects the humanities element or vice versa would help the course immensely. Lots of cool roleplaying activities, which was fun, but I'm uncertain as to how some of the roleplaying contributed to the integration of science and the humanities in the context of epidemics.</comment>I learned to like this class by the end. It is more science-heavy than humanities. During lecture it was basically all about the science behind the disease, until the last few lectures where it was pretty integrative. I often wished section were longer because only during section did we discuss the humanities aspects of the class and one hour is not enough. The Professors are very passionate about the material, though the science can be confusing and sometimes pretty dry, and the TFs are great. It was a little disorganized, but it is the first time being taught.</comment>It's a good SLS class for those who are not scientifically inclined as it doesn't have weekly PSets or anything like that, but there is still a good amount of science, so be prepared to deal with that. The teaching staff is very enthusiastic and works hard to make the class interesting, and they have a ton of experience on the subject. Not the most difficult class, but switching between hard science and looking at plague art can be taxing.</comment>This is a fun and enjoyable Gen-Ed. Though the frequent small assignments are a bit of a bother, the teaching staff is amazing and fully dedicated to making the course work. You'll learn a ton about a variety of diseases both scientifically and otherwise. Whether your angle is art, ethics, development, history, or english this course has something to offer you.</comment>Class is pretty easy but can be interesting if you take advantage of all of the readings (which you don't actually ever have to do).</comment>This course provides a good science class for students who either think they are not "science people" or are not sure whether or not they are "science people." The professors and TFs make the class a great experience.</comment>Definitely take this because the professors are willing to work with you and help you learn.</comment>SLS26 is new class with great ideas. It needs a little fine tuning (the readings can be long, but you don't have to finish them all; the lectures were sometimes an awkward mix of discussion and lecture) but in general it is a fascinating class that is great for non-science-y people, bolstered by a great teaching staff who really care about you. The quizzes may be a little hard if you aren't science inclined, but make sure to use all the resources you're provided (open book). The professors, and especially the TFs, really care about how you're doing, and are proactive about reaching out to you. The exam is really fair, and just requires general knowledge on the readings. I learned a lot from the this class, and would especially recommend it now that it's going into its second year.</comment>The class effectively bridges science and the humanities, and the professors and TFs are really understanding and want you to do well. They care about you as people and not simply as students.</comment>This is a really interesting course and worth taking. The staff is very accessible and genuinely interested in making the course the best it can be. It's interdisciplinary, which means there will be a portion of the course you may not be too fond of. If you're nervous about your science background this is an easy way to fulfill SLS. The only times you're tested on science is at 4 take-home, open book exams. Don't be fooled, they're still pretty difficult but if you refer to the relevant readings and remember lecture (and get good at googling) you'll be set. The subject is really relevant and it's a pretty rare course for focusing on it.</comment></course>EXPOS 10.007: Introduction to Expository Writing</title>Gives you great practice and guidance into writing and makes you feel more confident</comment>Only take this class if you feel you REALLY need help writing, or struggle greatly with writing in English. I was placed into 20, but decided to take this class because I wanted to be a better writer (have never written papers longer than 2-3 pages, etc). I'm not sure if this class has met those expectations. I think that I learned to be a better writer, but it was basically the exact same thing that is done in expos 20, except much slower. The slow pace leads to boredom, and I regret that now I have to do the same thing all over again in 20. Also, in both expos 10 and 20 it is pretty hard to get a good grade, so that is another con.  TLDR: I did learn quite a bit about how to analyze claims made by authors, and how to approach writing a lens/case essay (the same kind given on the freshman writing test), but I do wish I had just taken 20 and been done with it.</comment>I had no writing background and this class helped me so much. Jane is an amazing person and I learned so much from her. I am now much mor confident to take expos 20</comment>This class was so helpful. It forced me to really analyze the words I put on the page. I can't imagine not taking it.</comment>Jane is the best! She made the class very enjoyable with her great personality.</comment></course>MUSIC 262r: Composition: Seminar</title>It is great</comment></course>HINDI-URDU 103ar: Advanced Hindi-Urdu</title>It's a big jump up from 102 so make sure you revise grammar and vocab in your own time. It would also be great to keep up your Urdu/ Hindi over the summer as I was rusty when I came back and had to catch up again.</comment></course>VES 52r: Introduction to Non Fiction Videomaking</title>This class is absolutely amazing, and if you get a chance to take it you are a fool not to. In my senior year, I was blown away by the experience and think VES 52r could be my favorite (or top 2-3) classes while at Harvard. I had no previous experience with video or film and I feel I grew tremendously.   That said, the course is a massive time commitment. You'll need to spend a lot of time shooting, editing, etc. However, I found myself only ever looking to spend even more time working on my project; and the work felt like a welcome break from my other classes (editing/shooting feels very different than studying or writing papers).   Alfred and Lucy are both amazing and will take care of you. The whole VES crew feels like a family. You'll grow and learn a lot. Anyone who gets the chance to take this class is incredibly lucky.</comment>If you would like to start your exploration of how non-fiction movies are made, this is the place to start. The teaching staff is amazing, but get prepared to put a lot of time into it. Some weeks I spent more than 12 hours outside of class on filming and editing. However, it is worth it. Especially being able to produce a short non-fiction movie by yourself is an amazing opportunity. I would highly encourage groupwork with another classmate as working in a pair can really help you get another perspective on your work continuously. Once you take this class, you will really start appreciating the hard work and the plethora of choices that directors put into their movies.</comment>This course was a phenomenal experience. Filming and editing your own short documentary is incredibly time-consuming, so don't take this class on a whim. That said, it was the highlight of my semester. I've never had so much fun or worked so hard for a class, but it was entirely worth it.</comment>It requires a TON of time but was incredibly interesting. It is not worth it if you are not going to put the time into it, but it's an incredible opportunity to be creative and learn about different things/people all around Boston.</comment>This is a great place to start with video-making, provided you like non-fiction. There's a great balance between individual focus/freedom and extensive feedback. The works by filmmakers that you view in and outside of class are also great.</comment></course>MATH 115: Methods of Analysis</title>This is a great course. You will learn a lot of useful math (working with complex numbers, neat integration techniques, differential equations, etc.) - and not just the applications, but also the underlying theoretical stuff - without having to work to hard. In my opinion every physics concentrator (and probably anyone else who's planning on using a lot a math for whatever it is they do) should take this course.</comment>Absolutely take it. By course's end, you'll actually know how to calculate things using complex analysis.</comment>Great class for physics or applied math people!</comment>Course, which covers variety of interesting and useful topics and which doesn't become too complicated. Lectures are enjoyable and intensive.</comment></course>MICROBI 214: Mechanisms of Bacterial Pathogenesis and Host Immune Response</title>You will learn a lot about how pathogens are clever and awesome, and it really challenges you to think about future projects in the area.</comment>This is a great class! The professors that run it are extremely knowledgeable, and the topics are extremely interesting.</comment>This is the best paper discussion course I have taken, and an excellent introduction of a range of topics concerning microbial pathogenesis, ranging from secretion systems to manipulation of the immune system and the microbiome. All of the professor are knowledgeable and approachable.</comment></course>CHEM 101: Organic Synthesis Towards a Genomic Medicine</title>If you are interested in biology / chemical biology research take this class! Professor Schreiber gives great lectures on really interesting topics. Writing the proposals is definitely challenging and time-consuming, but it was ultimately really rewarding and interesting.</comment>This class gave a great overview of the many methods currently used to do research at the interface of organic chemistry and genetics.</comment>This is an interesting class that will greatly improve your scientific writing</comment>I would highly recommend this course - it offers a platform in which you learn to generate new ideas and decide how you're going to test those ideas experimentally.</comment>Take this class with an open mind, be prepared to read A LOT, and get ready to think hard about grant proposals. Strong background in either biology or synthetic chemistry (or both) is probably best. You need a knowledge base in at least one of these to succeed and be prepared to branch out into areas of weakness.</comment>If you are interested in pursuing research, this is an excellent course to take. Do not underestimate the grants though. They are very, very difficult to write. However, the course overall is very manageable and actually very interesting. I would certainly recommend other Chemistry concentrators take this course.</comment>If you're interested in any intersection of chemistry and biology and want to be exposed to the cutting edge of what's out there in biomedical and genomic medicine research, this class is a must take. The lack of busy work is very refreshing and while the 3 R01 proposals are a substantial amount of work, you get something out of it and practice your abilities to create real and feasible research proposals, which few other classes will truly expose you to.</comment>Work hard on your proposals!  They make your experience in the course much more fulfilling and give you the chance to be creative.  This class allows you to take risks.</comment>It's really what you want it to be.</comment>This is a great class for anybody who is interested in using organic chemistry to benefit human health.  It covers a very broad range of topics from natural product total synthesis to histone biochemistry to cancer biology, which gives students an appreciation for the interdisciplinary nature and incredible breadth of modern chemical biology.  The structure of the course allows you to focus on whatever interests you the most, which is good in some regards, but bad in others.  Listening to Prof. Schreiber talk about science, however, is always a treat and I always looked forward to lecture.</comment>Like all of the other responses probably say, the proposals are massive and will take way more time than you expect. Get started on them super early. Also, you really shouldn't take this class unless you have a good amount of lab/research experience. I only took the required Orgo and Chem and felt behind compared to the graduate students that mostly comprise the class.</comment>Make sure to spend a lot of time working on your proposals. Coming up with good ideas on your mini-proposals is essential.</comment>This is one of those classes where you don't really learn anything per se, but are responsible for picking a couple of things you're interested in and following up on them.  There's two proposals you'll have to write and those will basically be all-nighters, but aside from that there isn't too much work for the class.  But if you have any interest in going into research, learning how to structure and write up a proposal is a great thing to learn.</comment>Take Chem 101!!! You will learn so much from the lectures, and with the broad array of topics covered, there is bound to be something that you will find very interesting. You learn a lot from the grant proposals that you write -- this is the main assignment in the course -- and you get great feedback that will help you think about and write about your own ideas in the future.</comment>It's a great graduate class! I learnt a lot about current research in chemical biology and really improved my research proposal writing skills.</comment>The class is enjoyable and rarely stressful.</comment>This course is super stressful right before the big proposals so give yourself plenty of time to work on them.</comment>Highly recommend this class if you are interested in learning about how chemistry and biology can come together to address disease. There are no exams, so that is nice, but the proposals do take quite a bit of time to complete and should not be put off until the last moment. If proper planning is put into the proposals (and the discussion section helps with this a lot), then the proposals are great for learning how to be comfortable writing a NIH style research proposal.</comment>Be aware that most students in the class are grad students. I essentially did nothing for the class each week, but then spent like 15 hours writing each of my essays (they're really hard to write if you don't go to lecture or have much background in genome stuff, but it's doable), and my grades were good.</comment></course>COMPSCI 105: Privacy and Technology</title>TAKE THIS CLASS</comment>Everyone needs to take one class with Prof. Waldo before graduating.</comment>It is a great class to learn on a high-level about policy and technological issues regarding privacy. It is super manageable in terms of work -- a paper assigned every Thursday and due every Sunday that alternates between being individual and group-written. It is great for people of all backgrounds -- people of technology backgrounds are likely to learn about the policy side and vice versa. It's also a great way to meet people, and the final projects are a super fun time where you can explore topics in depth or create a cool program. Just try for the lottery -- if you show interest and creativity, there's a high chance you'll get in! (And an even higher chance you'll get in the next year!)</comment>Take this class! One of the best I have taken at Harvard. The TFs are great and Professor Waldo is a rare kind of professor at Harvard: he really cares about his students and takes the time to get to know them.</comment>This class is absolutely incredible -- you get to talk about privacy issues with an amazing group of driven, smart people. Also, Jim Waldo and Latanya Sweeney are such interesting, sociable, fun people, and I feel like I grew as a person while taking this class. Recommend with enthusiasm x 100.</comment>This is really a gem of a course. The peers who you talk with and who clearly all have something to say about privacy issues are incredibly diverse in the backgrounds they come from, which I think is one of the strongest facets of this course. Waldo and Sweeney are among the brightest minds in this field, and are incredible just to hear, let alone interact and speak with (to which they are surprisingly accessible). Super great course -- if you get in, do it. If you're not sure about applying, apply.</comment>This is an amazing class! You will get as much out of it as you put in. There are a some readings for every class but not as much towards the end of the class. The final project is open ended and a great way to investigate something you are passionate about. Prof Waldo has a lot of resources and really makes an effort to make the material accessible, interesting, and hands-on.</comment>This was the best course I have taken at Harvard. It is one of those courses that every student should have to take as it opens our eyes to so many pertinent issues of today.</comment>This was an excellent course overall; if you're a CS secondary who is less comfortable with some of the more technical courses, and you can get into CS105, then take it. Workload is extremely minimal, Waldo is a fantastic professor, and discussions are genuinely engaging.</comment>When I took this class, I was a senior majoring in Social Studies looking to complete her Culture and Belief requirement with a well-reviewed class. Though I came from a non-tech background and was in my last year of college, this course was one of the best experiences of my time at Harvard and continuously impacted my perspective. I just had so much FUN in class. Prof. Waldo and the other students selected for the class never ceased to be engaging. The assignments were thought-provoking and interesting to write. I am now considering ways in which I can incorporate my newfound understanding of privacy and technology in the long-term.</comment>Even though the application might seem daunting, just do it. It's a great course with a reasonable courseload that covers a lot of interesting materials. It's also not very technical in nature.</comment>This class is great and teaches you so much on how to shape a world view in today's technology age.</comment>This class gets very hyped up, but it's honestly a bit of a let down. The wide range of skills in the class means that you can't really touch on any topic with depth. In the end it was actually very boring.</comment>CS 105 is a great class. Jim Waldo is extremely enthusiastic about the class and really devotes himself to the class and students.</comment>This class hugely improved my ability to think about difficulties in developing policy around technologies, and about the interactions of technology, society, and governance.</comment>This course is interesting, hilarious, insightful, engaging, very manageable, and changes your approach to technology regardless of your background. I love the interdisciplinary nature of the people accepted to this course and the issues we covered. This course inspired me to write a government thesis on the topics we covered in lecture. Professor Waldo is one-of-a-kind. Apply for this class (get creative, humor helps), and be ready for a class unlike most at Harvard.</comment>Definitely take this class if you can get in, there are multiple topics in this class that blew my mind, I thought previously that I was oversuspicious etc but this course objectively shows you how far into the Panopticon we have descended in the most subtle way. It also teaches you to write position papers very well and gets you to think in depth about real world policy/regulatory implications. Super interesting class, Professor Waldo is amazing</comment>Worth taking. Ideally it would more rigorously examine both the relevant technology and policy issues, but it's still a fun and interesting survey of the core problems with privacy and technology. Big, big bonus points for being directly applicable to students' everyday concerns and experiences (and kudos to the teaching staff for actively trying to keep the course relevant to these concerns and experiences).</comment>This is an incredible class, but don't sleep on it. It's a good amount of writing. I almost think of it more as a government/policy class than a computer science class, but as a cs person it really pushed me to grow. I've learned an incredible amount in this class.</comment>Think of this class as an HBS course. While this class generally does not use a case study method, the way you learn things is very much through discussing ideas then applying them to the world around you. It isn't often that you get this in the context of computer science, and it is a welcome shift. There is a reason this course is heavily lotteryed, but if you get in you're going to have a good time.</comment>EVERYONE should try and be in this class. Even though Professor Waldo would probably say that the class is half "techies" and half "policy kids," don't be deterred if you don't fit either of these description. As digital natives in today's day and age, anybody has the interest and skillset required for a class like this. The class forces you to consider questions of privacy and technology that you have probably dabbled over discussions before briefly, but haven't really considered in depth. By nature of the class size and the application process (which is super easy, even though you'd be surprised how many people this prevents from trying for the class), you get to know the people in the class and Professor Waldo (who is awesome). The class changes as events unfold which makes it even better (ie. email threat scandal), and Jim Waldo's position within the university gives a really interesting perspective on privacy in the context of Harvard. TAKE THIS CLASS, EVERYONE!</comment>The content of this course was really interesting. As someone with no tech background, I learnt a lot from it, and also developed a desire to learn more in the future. Professor Waldo was informative, enthusiastic, and understanding of the fact that the class had a wide variety of people with different interests and skills. The course structure could sometimes be a bit annoying: the bi-weekly group papers are a nightmare to coordinate, especially if you are travelling on the weekends. The readings are somewhat inconsequential and don't come up in class: some are interesting to read anyway, though plenty of them are not.</comment>Definitely take this class! I took it for the gen ed requirement and it's the only gen ed class I've taken that I think actually gave me useful information for daily life. Professor Waldo is great, it's not too much of a time commitment, and you get to cover some really interesting topics!</comment>This class is completely eye opening. You should absolutely take it, and be prepared to learn a lot of shocking things about privacy that you take for granted.</comment>This course was very enjoyable--one of my favorite courses I have taken here at Harvard. Professor Waldo is one of the best professors I've encountered. The course might have been better, had I had a little background in technology and computer science (there were some conversations in class in which I felt I wasn't fully equipped to participate in), but the environment of the class was such that no matter what type of background you came from, there was still much to learn and enjoy.</comment></course>ECON 2010a: Economic Theory</title>Be warned that this class is not a walk in the part by any means. The first part is taught by Ed Glaeser and TFed by Kirill. Glaeser's lectures are very fast-paced. He is a brilliant man and believes that he has a mission to teach his class. I loved his lectures. However, I believe that one thing that Professor Glaeser has to realize is that his classes has way too much material in it. Given that his class has way more material than my other classes, my question is: do I learn more in this class than in a class with the proper amount of material? I believe the result is ambiguous: there is an income and a substitution effect in this case. There is more material to learn than in other classes, so I have more things to go over and I am smarter by going through all of it. I am afraid to say, though, that the substitution effect, which says that I have limited time and cannot handle all of Glaeser's material and all my other classes, is very strong. What happens is that Laibson's class and any other class you take ends up suffering. Even Glaeser's class suffers from the huge amount of material we have in a 6-week period. One suggestion I would leave for the instructor is: "Sometimes less is more"   Green's part is much easier than Glaeser's. There are fewer problem sets and class is more relaxed. I just found his exam to be unfair to what we learnt in class.  A note about the TAs: Kirill is not the best TAs you will ever have. I felt discouraged by his sections and stopped going early in the semester. However, I was very diligent about reading the section notes at home. After I started skipping section, I improved my grade substantially because I felt better about learning the material.  Annie's sections were dull. I went twice and regret going both times. She also posted the solution to the problem sets less than two weeks before the exam. The last solution set was posted two days before the exam. How does the instructor expect me to not study last minute?</comment>This course is hard work, but give macro the time time it deserves as well or you will pay for it later in the semester. Also, try to do the verbal problems with time limits.</comment>Don't be overly scared by Glaeser's part and verbals or Kirill's obsession with supermodularity. You'll eventually survive.</comment>The Game Theory part with Professor Green was fun and interesting -- definitely worth your bang for the buck.   For the Price Theory part, I guess be willing to teach yourself everything because you won't get much help from the professor or TA if you haven't already learned this material. If you've already learned it, I suppose the class would be interesting.</comment>Glaeser's part takes an unbelievable amount of time. I felt like I hardly had time for any other classes. If you're a G1, you have to take it, but if you're an undergrad, definitely factor the heavy time commitment into your decision. Game theory is certainly nontrivial, but is much more manageable.</comment></course>ECON 1150: Data Analysis: A Project Class</title>Ec1150 is a great opportunity to apply knowledge of econometric and statistical techniques to solve real problems with large datasets. The course is very open-ended and self-defined, and you should be very comfortable with planning out and pacing your research throughout the term. The statistical knowledge you'll gain will be very specific to your project, but the general research and client management skills you come away with, although less tangible, are arguably more valuable than knowledge of any particular econometric technique.</comment>This is the coolest course I've taken. The teaching staff is phenomenal. You get a chance to work on really cool, real world issues, and you'll learn a ton</comment>Sendhil is excellent at creating courses with real-world applicability. This class is no exception. If he continues offering it, I highly recommend you take it. Sendhil and Pascal are a great tag team. Somehow they're able to allow for a massive variety of different projects and experiences while still creating a positive experience for everyone. Great course.</comment>Take this class!!! If you do so, I recommend that you (1) make sure the problem you're working on matters to you, and (2) if you can pick your group beforehand that would be ideal - you will be spending a lot of time with your group. With an interesting project and a good group this class would be a great experience.</comment>This class was pretty interesting. In giving us exposure to "data analysis in the real world"-- it did that. Did I learn anything about the data analysis methods- not really. Was group work hard?- Absolutely especially when people had different backgrounds. Was this an easy workload class? - Absolutely. Having 30 minute meetings each week made the class very easy in terms of deliverables.</comment>You will be assigned along with three other students to one client, and you will help that client with a data project. That's it: no lectures, no sections, just a brief weekly meeting. If you have a client with a cool project and clean data, you've got an easy, enjoyable, and unique semester ahead. If you get stuck with a bad project, things could go south fast.</comment>By far the most rewarding class at Harvard. The combination of potential for self-improvement while completing a task for a real-world client is unparalleled.</comment>Great opportunity to work on very cool projects with very cool companies/organizations, under the guidance of a great prof-TF team. Students selected for the course generally tend to be quite motivated so group work is generally a good experience (based on personal anecdotes and on talking to friends).</comment>Great course—Sendhil is a fantastic professor, and the class is very hands-on and allows you to take the initiative to learn.</comment>Take this course if you have a good group in mind walking in. The entire course is structured as a semester-long case worked on by a group of four people, so having friends who you know and trust in the course is a good idea. Be prepared to conduct fairly in-depth data cleaning, regressions, and more rigorous statistics techniques. It's fairly low work if your group is good, but can be stressful if you don't have the right people.</comment>It's a very hands off project and you're working with a group for the entire semester, so be wary and pick good people to work with if you can. The class involves a decent amount of statistical coding, so at least 1 or 2 people in a group should be extremely comfortable and strong in R or Stata. Overall, it was a great class -- you work with a real client and help them solve a data problem. There are some pros and cons to the lack of structure, but this class couldn't happen in any other way, and it's a great real life learning experience.</comment>This a great class that closes the gap between the academic world and the professional world when it comes to data analysis</comment>Despite the drawbacks of this course in terms of organization and guidance (I would guess that these issues will be fixed soon since this was the first offering of the class), this is an ENORMOUSLY helpful class that will challenge you and strengthen your skills considerably, whether you are applied math, econ or any other concentration.</comment>If you can get into this class, take it. Sendhil and Pascal are awesome -- you'll learn a ton.</comment>Very unstructured course. Can be a good fit for some, bad fit for others. Not bad for its first year, but could use some improvement.</comment>My friend liked to call this class "Consulting-101", which is pretty accurate. This class will give you hands on experience, working with a client to answer their question. If you're willing to put in the time, this class will be an incredible learning experience for you.</comment>I enjoyed the "real world" aspect of this class, in that you get to work with an actual company on an actual project, and a lot of the companies are really cool. However, some of the structural aspects of this class could be improved. For example, having a final presentation, an individual final paper, and a group final paper all due during reading period/finals is not something I really want to repeat. But hopefully the organization of the class will improve in future offerings.</comment>This has been my favorite experience here at Harvard, and I am pretty sure it will be the best class I take here.  This class is incredible-you are able to work with data that is normally extremely difficult to receive, engage with your team and client, and learn real-world skills for problem solving.  THIS CLASS IS AMAZING!! all ec concentrators should take it (if you make the big lottery!)</comment>group data projects are difficult and messy and take more time than you think, but if you get down and dirty in the data you can learn a lot</comment>Especially for this being the first year it was run, the course was quite good.  I think most likely the most common complain will be that people ran into issues with there data or things along those lines - this makes sense - it was the first time the course was run, and the instructors did not anticipate the full extent to which the other parties would delay in getting their data over.  I imagine that they will arrange things in a way so that this is less of an issue next year.  Moreover, the course is meant to introduce you to real-life data work, of which dealing with data issues is an aspect.</comment>This class is a really cool way to get involved with real world economics. It has been an incredible process to actually come up with economic answers that have actual implications for our group's client. The group component of this class is a bit hit or miss.</comment>This class would be perfect if it taught students to grow up and work with other people. Or let you officially work by yourself. As is, you're just exposed to the bad, the ugly, and the uglier in people. Welcome to the real world.</comment>This is a really great opportunity to apply Econometrics principles to real-world problems. Our client actually visited campus to hear our final presentation, and really appreciated the work we completed throughout the semester.</comment>Possibly best class I've taken. Basically just one big project - very fun to think about, and great not to have exams and the like. Good preparation for real world. Had a really fun problem (micro-finance for me) to work on, and enjoyed the whole experience immensely.</comment>It's not really a class, it's a project...a little more involvement would have been nice.</comment>Class is highly dependent on the project you get. Your very likely to get a great one. Some groups had a tough time with their clients and/or data however.</comment>This class is a challenge because the assignments are open-ended and you construct them yourself. But that's what's awesome. Someone actually reads your work and listens to your ideas. You get to have impact!</comment></course>ASTRON 251: Quantum Mechanics for Astrophysics</title>The course efficiently covers a huge amount of material in a relatively short amount of time.</comment>Good for fulfilling the physics requirement. Not much work, and gives insight into how atomic spectra are calculated.</comment>This is a solid course covering a range of basic (and some advanced) topics in quantum mechanics. Familiarity with the physical concepts and prior experience with the mathematical formalism is assumed.</comment></course>COMPSCI 227r: Topics in Cryptography and Privacy</title>Put in the time; see what the specific topic is.</comment>Mark</comment>The class material is definitely difficult, so please don't be hesitate to ask questions during lectures and during Office Hours.</comment></course>EXPOS 10.006: Introduction to Expository Writing</title>This course will make experienced writers feel more comfortable about their writing, and less experienced writers feel like they have the necessary tools to succeed in writing the American essay.</comment>Take it and you will like the materials you are assigned to read.</comment>The class is very helpful due to the very high availability of the teachers. In class, we go over how to edit papers and we revise them as a class. It may seem odd at first, but then you will get a feel of what other people think about how writing should be, which helps you become a better writer because you are conferencing directly with an audience.</comment>Expos 10 is a fantastic class and it is a great way to boost your writing skills before taking expos 20.</comment>This class is great for helping students transition their writing to what is expected in college.</comment></course>HIST 2400: Readings in Colonial and Revolutionary America: Proseminar</title>Professor Ulrich is an enthusiastic and engaging instructor, and she will introduce you to a number of important works and themes in Early American history. However, at times the structure of the course may be less than clear, as may be the reasons for certain reading selections.</comment>Make sure you have a baseline knowledge of the core events in early American history--I think you will get more out of the course with that background.</comment></course>MODMIDEAST 100: Approaches to Middle Eastern Studies</title>Engaging in the history of the Ottoman Empire, European influence and the current politics, this course really encompasses the history of the modern Middle East.</comment>Not a hard class, but it could benefit from some revision. It's more on North Africa than the Modern Middle East. That being said, some lectures and materials are relevant and interesting, and I feel that I've left the course with a basic understanding of some aspects of Middle Eastern history (mostly pertaining to Egypt and Tunisia.)</comment>Modern Middle East is overall a wonderful survey course that begins in during the Ottoman Empire and goes all the way through the Arab Spring and the subsequent transitions. If you do not know much about the Middle East other than what you have gleaned from various news sites or headlines, this is a great elective to take without overworking yourself. You should be aware though that there is a significant amount of historical buildup before actually delving into the Arab Spring and present day, some of which gets tedious.</comment>The class is not hard but it's very poorly taught. Lectures are pretty bad- Zeghal is smart but rambles on and deviates from her lesson. She does not seem to have any outline or structure for her lectures. Section does not cover much and does not facilitate participation. The class covers more of the facts of history but only in a superficial way and does not really analyze or question them.</comment>The professor herself was amazing and really had a strong understanding of the course material. She has a lot of experience in the field and is able to answer any questions about the field. This being said, our semester we focused more on the history and politics of North Africa (mainly Tunisia and Egypt). I do think I gained a good understanding of these regions, but I would have preferred to take a more holistic approach to the entire region and covered more countries and cases.</comment>This is a solid intro to the Middle East. If you want to understand a bit more about what is going on in the news, or to study more later on, this is probably a good option. If you can stay on top of the readings, they are very interesting, but not necessary for the course. That said, there may be other seminars or courses that are more thrilling.</comment>Take very good notes in class.</comment>If you're interested in learning about the Middle East in general (without getting hung up on minute details and dates) then this class is great. A wonderful overview of the past couple of centuries. Lays a foundation for further exploration in the field. Definitely relevant to today's conflicts in the Middle East.</comment>This is a fantastic course and I would highly recommend it as an easy elective for non-concentrators.  the material is fascinating and timely and the teaching staff really cares about you and wants you to succeed.  This class is very easy, so it's tempting to not take it seriously. But if you devote time to it you will gain a whole new perspective on the Middle East.</comment>This class provides useful background for students of the Middle East at all levels of study.</comment>this class is cool and relevant</comment>Mary the TF is the best.</comment>I had never taken a class on the Middle East and was so happy I took this. This is a great class with themes very relevant to current events in the Middle East and North Africa. You talk about the Ottoman Empire and then move forward to political Islam, authoritarianism, and Arab Spring. I was able to talk about news of ISIS and Iran much more intelligently. However, I will say that lectures can sometimes be confusing. It is hard to know how some of the things that Professor Zeghal says connect to each other. That being said, I would still take this class. The periodic quizzes ensure that you keep up with the themes, so I felt like I would learn despite my confusion. At the end of the class, I realized how much I knew about the Middle East so it was worth it! Mary is a great TF and she and Professor Zeghal were very approachable.</comment>This course offers a great introduction to the history of the modern Middle East, from the Ottoman Empire to the Arab Spring with a general focus on the North Africa region in particular Tunisia and Egypt.</comment>This is a great class! Everyone who is taking it is truly interested in the material, and Professor Zhegal and Mary are a great duo who share a wealth of knowledge. They also really encourage participation. One downside is the highlighted focus on Tunisia and Egypt, and negligence of some other situations. Still, a lot can be derived from the two places to explain other situations. Take the class!</comment>This is a great survey course and helpful for anyone interested in Middle Eastern studies. Malika is super nice and an interesting lecturer. She does a great job of picking guests lecturers as well. Come to class as everything you need to know will be mentioned!!</comment></course>EXPOS 20.230: Slave Narratives</title>its a lot of fun</comment>Reading assignments for the class were fair and beneficial. Writing essays was a completely different story. You pretty much learn nothing over the course of this class, and the comments you receive are not helpful whatsoever. Even the writing center did not know what to make of some of the comments I received from this class. My friends in other expos classes did not have this problem at all; they had very responsive and helpful preceptors. I would say the only motive to writing essays in this class is to please the prof, but even then virtually no one in the class knows what he wants most of the time. You are almost guaranteed to completely start over for all or most of your essays in this class. If feedback is important for you, I would NOT(!!) recommend this class at all. I do have to say though that this prof is more reasonable about reading assignments than others. It is definitely possible to read everything, although it was pretty hard to finish Beloved. Some students had the advantage of reading it before, so I would recommend trying to read it in advance, if possible. Otherwise, you'll end up like me and have to sit for hours on end trying to read it and make sense of it all.</comment>If you are interested in learning about the traditional slave narrative and how that changed throughout time, or if you are interested in a expos class that requires reading only three books and watching two films, try out this class!</comment>This class is challenging. Dr. Becker presents to you and encourages you to write in a new way. I had never done "close reading" before this class, and it was difficult to adjust to this new style of tearing apart a paragraph in a text to find deeper meaning. I definitely strengthened my writing skills after this class; there was a remarkable different from my first essay and my research paper. You should try to meet with Dr. Becker as much as possible to discuss your essays and how to improve them--I found that this was the most effective way to improve my writing.</comment>Dr. Becker is a great Professor! Really articulates reasoning well. You will read literature and films much more closely than before and understand what it means to write an arguable thesis. He also brings in coffee and cookies on your birthday! Really nice guy.</comment>Make sure that you realize this is NOT a class where you talk about the impacts of slavery on today's world. You will learn more about the authors of the books than the Underground Railroad. In this class you will analyze diction, style, why authors wrote things a certain way. So its great if you are interested in the reading list but this is not a course to solely learn about slavery.</comment>Take this class! You won't regret it!</comment>This course is like any expository writing course in that it has 3 papers you must write, and they are difficult to get As on, especially that last one, as it is a research paper. But Professor Becker teaches well and is a great resource, always readily available to students, so that makes the class more manageable.</comment>One of the best expos 20 classes offered. If you have any interest in the subject (which you probably should) take this class. Becker teaches you a whole lot about writing and close reading.</comment>If you're looking to improve your writing, this most likely is not the course for you. If you enjoy analyzing literature and are okay with your current writing skills, sign on up.</comment>If you are interested in Slave Narratives you won't be disappointed</comment></course>ARABIC 242ar: Arabic Five</title>This class is amazing.</comment>That the readings are worthy and relevant but that the management of the class is unpredictable.</comment>This class is definitely a good way to practice your Arabic reading and writing, but be prepared for the workload.</comment>This really was the most important course I have taken in my time studying Arabic at Harvard. I took this course after three years of MSA and went into it expecting it to be very challenging, which it definitely was, but it was also extremely useful in terms of language acquisition. You will be required to write a response paper in high-register academic Arabic each fortnight, and you will be shocked by the improvement you see in each paper. Professor al-Ghadeer's comments on the papers were invariably incisive and extremely useful. The language component aside, what really makes this course is the content. You will read an awesome selection of modern novels and view them through the lens of important philosophical and psychoanalytical writings including those of Kant, Lacan, Freud and Derrida. As you will learn to appreciate, the current moment in the Arabic literary movement, as observed through the 21st century novel, is one facet of a much larger intellectual discourse which you will read about in the philosophical/psychonanalytical texts in the course. Overall, I recommend the course most enthusiastically, it really is a gem of the department and Prof. al-Ghadeer is a formidable mentor that all students should take advantage of.</comment></course>APCOMP 274: Computational Modeling of Fluids and Soft Matter</title>Sauro really knows his stuff and clearly cares about tailoring the class to the abilities and interests of his students. The material can be challenging depending on your background in physics and computation, but the workload was pretty low. Be prepared to be called up to the board!</comment>I believe this class is great if you are pursuing excellence in fluid mechanics and soft matter. The class let you explore a topic of interest with the guidance of high-level teaching staff.</comment></course>SOCIOL 248: Race, Politics, and Social Inequality: Seminar</title>This course requires in depth engagement with the sociological literature on race; set aside plenty of time to read all material in depth</comment>This class is purely discussion-based, and thus it is important that you do the reading. (This is taken care of, however, through the weekly reading responses.) The weekly reading responses do make the class take a decent amount of time during the week, but they really help you formulate ideas about the overall picture of the course and the subject for that week. Overall, I really enjoyed this course, especially with the mixed-methods approach and the professor's emphasis on big-picture arguments.</comment>This is a great class. The weekly reading responses are really annoying, but discussions are always interesting and Bobo is a great discussion leader. It was definitely worth it.</comment>Very comprehensive and stimulating course!</comment>Everyone should have to take this course--at Harvard and everywhere. It dispels any nonsense myths about the status quo of race relations in America being better than they actually are, and brings both quantitative and qualitative insights to bear on important questions dealing with race, politics, and inequality in the U.S.</comment>You will need to be aggressive about connecting with Prof. Bobo. He is not very responsive over email.</comment>This is a great class! Be prepared for a lot of reading and writing, but if you work hard on it you'll get a lot out of the class discussions. Professor Bobo is great and it's a wonderful opportunity to learn from a leader in the field.</comment>If you are interested in relations between blacks and whites in America, take the course. This course is not so relevant to other racial groups, or to other places.</comment></course>COMPLIT 270: Urban Imaginary and Visual Culture</title>A great inspiration for creative research.</comment>The readings are hard. You will not get everything, but it is still worth it.</comment></course>STAT 210a: Probability Theory</title>This is a course for the deep theory of useful probability knowledge.</comment>If you are an undergrad statistics concentrator I highly recommend this class to you! I am an undergrad who took the class junior year, one year after taking stat 110/111. I think it's definitely very doable if you are self-motivated and did well in 110. You will gain a very deep understanding of all the concepts behind stat 110 and enhance your understanding of probability in a very big way. Jun and Carl are good lecturers, but it's Joe and Carl's book that really shines. Read the book, do the pencil problems, and try the exercises, and you will come out with a great understanding of the material. The examples, problem sets, and exams in the class are all well-motivated and you will even gain some insights into techniques used in other stat classes. Overall this class will give you a solid theoretical foundation for all your other stat classes. It was an absolute joy taking this class. Highly recommended.   difficulty: moderate. 3.5/5 8-10 hours of studying outside of class.</comment>This course does a great job of going over essential material for probability theory, and in particular goes over many important theorems that likely many statistics students have heard of (such as the Central Limit Theorem), but likely many students are not familiar with on a deep level. However, students will have to teach themselves most of the material. Often they will find the lectures and textbook are not enough to fully understand the material, and will have to rely on outside textbooks and lectures to truly learn the material.</comment>Humph!</comment>This was an interesting class. It builds nicely upon Stat 110, but is significantly harder. Be prepared to put in a lot of work. The professors were really nice, but lecture often seemed like a waste of time since it was significantly less clear than the book. However, Blitzstein will also be back next year, so I don't know how that will change things.</comment>This class was the hardest I have ever taken. Professor Liu was the worst lecturer I have ever encountered. He frequently trailed off in class, lost his train of thought, and struggled to communicate in clear English. 

Professor Morris, on the other hand, was generally helpful and available for extra help. 

But then again, this was Blitzstein's off year.</comment>210a had one of the best textbooks and some of the worst lectures of any course I've taken at Harvard.</comment>Maybe avoid this class unless you really have to take it.  It may be much better with different instructors.</comment></course>HIST 2050: Medieval Societies and Cultures: Proseminar</title>I can't recommend this class enough. It will change how you think about your work and your field, no matter what it is.</comment>Excellent introduction to medieval historiography</comment>Dan provokes lively discussions, gives helpful assignments, generates thought-provoking questions, and encourages reflection on your own work and on work in the field more widely. This is a fantastic class.</comment>An excellent and innovative introduction to the contemporary practice of medieval historiography.</comment></course>SOCIOL 165: Inequalities in Health Care</title>This class started off strong for me with lectures about healthcare policy ranging from the ACA to Medicare and Medicaid. I loved learning that stuff, but after you learn the basics of the American health care system, the class goes in an entirely different direction. You start talking in vague terms about vulnerable groups and biases that are obviously important, but very low in actual substance. I ended up finding the 75% of the class's content pretty uninteresting. I don't recommend taking this class unless you're sure you like the kind of sociological investigations that involve this content-less, loosey-goosey stuff. Some people like the class, I definitely didn't, because I wanted something different out of it. If you're hoping to learn about health care in a real way for a whole semester than this isn't for you.</comment>This class is applicable to everybody and it teaches you a lot about the healthcare system and how everything works. Professor Ruggie is fantastic, but sometimes sections feels useless.</comment>It gives you insight on the health care system in America but the assignments may be more confusing than expected and participation is graded harshly.</comment>This is a very low workload, chill class that will allow you to learn the inns and outs of Medicare, Medicaid and the ACA (useful knowledge for all!). It will also open your eyes up to some of the injustices in the health care system and change the way you view the provision of care to the nation's poorest populations. Exams are relatively predictable, and the take-homes were especially easy to prepare for. You do not need to complete all the readings week to week.</comment>TAKE THIS COURSE YOU WILL LEARN SO MUCH AND ITS SO INTERESTING AND PROFESSOR RUGGIE IS AMAZING.</comment>If you're looking for a chill class, this is not the one. But if you're really curious about healthcare in the US (Obamacare, how poverty affects healthcare outcomes, etc), it's a solid class</comment>This class has a very low workload, but gives you a broad overview of key topics within the healthcare system, such as various types of insurance and the Affordable Care Act, which you spend a whole month on. Then you discuss vulnerable groups and the health challenges they face. Over the course of the semester, the exams focused more on policy analysis / recommendations which I enjoyed. Overall, a decent, not too difficult class that allows you to become more familiar with the healthcare system. However, the TF really emphasized section participation and had an overly strict method of grading it. But the TF may change for next year.</comment>I would like to tell future students that this course is extremely rewarding and will beautifully open your eyes to the rampant disparities that still persist in healthcare in America. It's so easy to think of health issues in other countries, but the United States has a lot of problems when it comes to treating disease and preventing illness. This class will help you become an informed, caring, and intellectual citizen.</comment>I loved everything I learned in this class! I don't think my grades always reflected the amount of work I put into the class, but at the end of the day, I'm glad I took it for the enriching information I learned about the US healthcare system.</comment>This is a really interesting course for students like me who have a strong interest in US healthcare policy. I wouldn't recommend taking this class if you don't have interest in that because you will find the readings very boring and long. However, this is an amazing class if you are curious about the ACA and what the US healthcare landscape looks like right now. There are way too many readings but you can also get by without doing them all.</comment>I would not recommend the course due to the TFs grading policy</comment>Don't take this course unless you have knowledge of the health care system and of the expectations in the sociology discipline</comment>I think all premeds can strongly benefit from this course. Everything that is discussed is crucial for future physicians to know because really do premeds learn about the social side of health care. You learn a lot about private and public health insurance, which is again important for premeds, but also for all of us college age students who can be under our parents' health insurance until 26 (something good that came with Obamacare!). We will all need to be aware of at least some of these details in life. Why not learn it now?

More specifically, I suggest taking notes when reading and outlining everything you know about each topic for the exams. Take the exams seriously because specific details are needed.</comment>This course was interesting and well taught. I took this class because it sounded cool but by the end, this actually made me interested in Global Health and Health Policy as a secondary.</comment></course>AFRAMER 90r.q: Zulu</title>It may seem like a small amounts of work on the surface, but before tests and quizzes it will require a lot of time for you to go over course material.</comment>This is a moderate course that you can really enjoy taking.</comment>It is a great class that teaches you a lot about Zulu Culture while you learn an interesting language.</comment>Take this class!! Ntuli is an amazing instructor, and you'll really be surprised by how much you end up learning by the end of the semester. Great intro to Zulu.</comment>It is a great class and the instructor is very passionate about the class.</comment>its a great environment to learn an awesome language</comment>Really cool professor that is a pleasure to know. Sometimes class can be confusing, but between other students and just asking what she meant after class everything can be resolved.</comment>This class is fun and interactive.</comment>Very fun class, can be confusing at times but that can be expected with any language. highly recommend if trying to fill language requirement.</comment></course>THI 102a: Intermediate Thai I</title>Amazing class!!!! You'll not only learn the language but also so much of Thai's culture.</comment></course>EXPOS 10.005: Introduction to Expository Writing</title>If you have any hesitations about your writing, definitely take this class. I was a little bit worried that they type of writing required of me in high school (mainly just timed AP essays) would not be up to par with what was expected at Harvard, and I was right. That being said, this class was not incredibly difficult and I feel that I am walking away a much better writer. Since I am likely to concentrate in the humanities, I also decided that having a strong foundation in writing could only help me later on in my college career. The class is small, so you get a lot of really good feedback and get to know everyone pretty well. I highly recommend it!</comment>I took this class even though I was placed in Expos 20 because I though it will help me be more prepared for Expos 20. Even though the class did help me a lot, I was not completely satisfied with it. The assignments took me a lot of time to complete and I was very overwhelming sometimes. Moreover some of these writing assignments were not completely useful to write the final version of your essay. One good thing about the class though, is that if you had not had any previous experience with writing, it will help you learn how to write at an academic level. In that sense it does gives you some experience so you do not walk into Expos 20 without a clue of how to approach a writing prompt.</comment>This introductory course is very beneficial to giving you a foundation of college writing, more specifically the Harvard standard of writing. The assignments are very helpful, and the feedback that you receive from each assignment is beneficial to making you a much better writer than before.</comment>Take only if you have the desire to improve your writing or else this is just another writing class. In my opinion I shouldn't have taken it since I didn't take this class seriously enough so I didn't think this class was all that helpful, but expos10 keeps getting rave reviews so perhaps it is a very good class if you are willing to put in the effort.</comment>It is a great class for anyone who feels like they didn't receive a really strong background in writing academic papers in high school. Even if AP English classes were taken, this class opens up students to a whole new kind of writing at a good pace.</comment>It's the best! Take it, it's awesome!</comment>Take this course if you have any doubts in your writing abilities</comment>It's incredible</comment>Really helpful, especially if you feel a bit self-conscious about your writing.</comment></course>MUSIC 193r: Topics in Music from 1800 to the Present: Proseminar</title>The subject matter is thoroughly repulsive, but studying it is ultimately rewarding. We have an ethical obligation to recognize this aspect of our culture.</comment>It was an intellectually challenging and enlightening class for me, and I highly recommend it.</comment>Emotionally/psychologically loaded, but makes you see U.S. race relations in a new light.</comment></course>MATH 233a: Theory of Schemes I</title>It is always hard to leave comments for higher-level math courses, as the quality of the course depends significantly on the instructor. Scheme theory itself is very important in mathematics, so it is important to learn the material well with a good instructor. I would only recommend this course if the instructor has a good reputation for lecture ability; otherwise, the lecturer can ruin your perception of scheme theory. Unfortunately, I was not wise enough to follow my own advise and my own intuition, and as a result, I had to sit through what is by far the worst class I have taken at Harvard. Sit through the first two lectures during shopping week; if your intuition tells you that you aren't going to enjoy the class, don't take it!</comment>Easily the hardest assignments of any math class I've ever taken</comment>Schemes is an extremely beautiful subject, as well as quite fundamental in modern mathematics. I recommend it highly. Beware, it may be a lot of work.</comment></course>PHIL 13: Morality and Its Critics</title>This course was a really great introductory course to philosophy. The readings can be a bit tough (Kant...ugh). But the professor is super animated and engaging. Papers are fairly simple and straightforward. I would recommend this course for anyone who wants to learn about different basic moral arguments.</comment>Be active in discussions to argue the morality of these different subjects.</comment>Really nice intro to philosophy - low workload, interesting discussion topics, and clear guidance on how to write a philosophy paper.</comment>Take this class if you have already have an interest in philosophy or ethics. This class will probably not make you fall in love with philosophy. The workload is not bad, just two papers +final/paper. There are two short readings a week.</comment>Great course and Prof. Bagley has been my favorite so far, but the reading can be dense and difficult. A moderately large time commitment.</comment>I found this course to be a great introduction to morality and philosophy in general. I learned how to write a philosophy paper (pro tip: you don't need to have an epiphany) and how to read philosophy. The way the course is structured makes the material digestible and you improve your philosophy reading skill so by the time you read Kant and Bernard Williams, they are not as difficult as you might imagine them to be. You should be committed to doing the reading, but besides that the workload is not too difficult. There are only 2 graded papers and a final paper. The class discussion is also good when everyone participates, so hopefully you will be interested in the material and participate.</comment>I loved this class! It was so interesting! If you're looking for a solid intro to philosophy class, I would highly recommend it.</comment>You get what you put in. That being said, this is a very thought provoking class. You begin to analyze situations in ways that you never thought you would or could be able to. The professor and section leader are both very nice. No homework assignments just readings and essays. I would highly recommend this class to anyone who wants to take a intro to morality class</comment>Take it pass fail. It gives a lot of good background to well known philosophers constantly being referenced in other courses. The work is basically optional, but so helpful to know these things.</comment></course>SOC-WORLD 43: Japan's Samurai Revolution</title>This class is great! You learn so much about history and Japan's history in particular. Prof. Miller is a much more engaging instructor than Prof. Howell, but you come to love both of them. It's also a great class to tell people that you're taking. I strongly recommend taking this class.</comment>The class itself is awesome. Plan ahead for finals though</comment>Only take this class if you're really into history and are used to the amount of reading associated with real history classes (not gen-eds) at this school. I took it as a science concentrator and even though I enjoyed the material (I love history, and this happens to be a cool topic), I really didn't appreciate the fact that it's treated as far more than a gen-ed in terms of what is expected from you. Don't expect to be able to get away without doing the reading; I think it worked for some people but it requires being a serious veteran of catching up on reading before the exams, which require textual knowledge. Also note that this class is not entirely on samurai; it's on the samurai-led Meiji revolution (1868), so although the first half of the semester is about Tokugawa samurai and the factors leading up to the shogunate's fall, the second half barely mentions samurai at all except for the Satsuma rebellion of 1877. So it's not as much a class on the samurai as of societal change in Japan over the 18th and (mostly) 19th centuries. You're not expected to know information before the class; it's very inclusive. Do, however, check the syllabus and make sure you know what you're getting yourself into with regard to assignments; we had a take-home midterm right after we handed in our in-class midterm, which was a bummer to say the least, and this class has a final paper AND exam. Shop this class, definitely, because it's very interesting, but if you're just looking for a gen-ed to fulfill SW and don't have a strong interest in this topic, definitely do another class.</comment>Professors Howell and Miller are fantastic and enthusiastic about the material. They work very hard to get to know their students and to improve the course based on the feedback of students. Without a doubt they made the material fun - I can't say that I was really bored at any point during lectures, even though the material could have been very dry. Hannah was terrific and went out of her way to be helpful and accessible - and to sort through any thorny topics from lecture.  Some readings were incredible, others...not so much… The final project/final exam combination was a bit excessive and a TON of work out of nowhere at the end of the semester, much in contrast to the light workload of the rest of the semester. That being said, Professors Howell and Miller both said that they are working to revamp the course in future offerings.  Definitely take this course if you are interested in the evolution of Japanese culture and the modernization of Japan. If you aren't, you might want to approach this course with the understanding that it is VERY backloaded and that readings might get tedious</comment>Take it! Professors Howell and Miller are truly knowledgable, witty, and care about how well you do in the class. Head TF Hannah Shepherd went above her requirements in helping us in section and in office hours. One of the best General Education classes I've taken, and now I am seriously considering a secondary in East Asian Studies!</comment>If you're looking for a Gen Ed to fill out your schedule, definitely take this course. The professors are fantastic and genuinely care about the students, especially with the small class size. Hannah was an awesome TF: always available whenever you needed her and willing to help out with just about anything. You'll learn a lot about not only Japanese history but also how to think like a historian. Great class overall.</comment>If you want a small lecture class and small section with plenty of student-faculty interaction, this the class for you!</comment>This class is pretty fun and would probably be a great precursor to taking the Imperial Japan course.</comment>This course is awesome and educational.</comment>If you have any interest in Japan and how its transformation from the shogunate to the nation-state happened, definitely take this course! If you have no interest in Japan but would be willing to take a class, this would again be perfect because it neither requires you to know anything about Japan nor assumes you do!</comment>This is a good class to take if you have a passion for history and/or if you have an appreciation for Japanese culture and tradition.</comment>The course is fairly fast-paced, and the reading load is moderate - definitely something you have to dedicate time to. That being said, the course is very interesting, and doing work and writings for the class is a great pleasure. There is both a final paper and a final exam, which can, depending on your schedule, make exams period a tad tricky.</comment>If you think you have even a vague interest in Japan and its history and culture or if you'd just like to take a fascinating humanities course, take this class. There is a lot of reading, and doing this course the right way demands that you be engaged with the texts, but the readings are tailored to the topics touched on in class and are really indispensable to your general understanding of the history covered in this course. If you pay attention in lecture and find subjects that interest you for the assignments, you'll get something out of it.</comment>I came into college saying that I would take at least a course about Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and South America. This course definitely fulfilled my self-imposed requirement while also teaching me about the study of history both in terms of techniques and source materials. If you want a classic history course to fulfill your SW gen-ed I would definitely recommend it. I feel that I cam out of the course with an impressive array of new knowledge. I found the exams to be very manageable and while the final research project was a challenge I think you get as much out of it as you put in.</comment>Although this is a gen ed, it still requires that materials be bought.</comment>A very good introduction to Japanese modernity. For grad students almost a bit too easy.</comment>A great class! I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is looking to fulfill this gen-ed. This class does require a final paper and final exam so I would just take that into consideration when choosing classes that might have a difficult exam period.</comment></course>MUSIC 4: Introduction to Composition</title>This class is great for people who don't have any background in composing, and don't have any background in theory. Although, I wish the class was a little more open to people who do have some theory knowledge, it was still a great way to start composing and has really made me appreciate the value of composition in improving you as a musician in the future</comment>Definitely give this course a try. It has its flaws, like the unnecessary coursebook and requirement that every composition be handwritten. However, it's ultimately worth it - especially hearing what you write brought to life by professional musicians. The work load is moderate to light, until the final project, when it's considerably heavy.</comment>Take this course if you have even the slightest interest in composition. Take this course if you don't care for composition, have never composed before, or even know what composition means. It will change your life, let alone your harvard undergraduate experience.</comment>If you are interested in composition or songwriting but don't have much formal experience with it, then I would wholeheartedly recommend this course. Dr. Netzer is a phenomenal teacher and is incredibly passionate about music of all types. Some of the music you study in this course may seem a bit strange at first, especially if you aren't familiar with contemporary classical music, but it is relevant to understanding how to best express your own musical ideas.</comment>BEWARE OF THIS CLASS IF YOU ARE A BEGINNER OR THINK THIS WILL BE A NICE FUN ELECTIVE. I took this class as someone who has 12+ years of classical piano experience, and still found the assignments extremely challenging and the last assignment (writing an entire 5 minute string quartet) was absolutely impossible. However, composing your own pieces and having a recording of them forever is a great feeling, despite challenges that lead to the final product. The grading is nice and overall it is a very safe learning environment for beginners, but Dr. Netzer can be extremely harsh and critical, which especially mortifying when your piece is played in front of the whole class. I repeat, this is NOT a class for beginners, even though it is promoted as so. DO NOT TAKE if you are wishing for an easy elective or even think you have a little music experience.</comment>A truly great class, a lot of work but it is worth it</comment>This was hands down the best course I've ever taken at Harvard. It does exactly what it's designed to do - to introduce students with minimal background in music and theory to writing music. But do beware that the course does not cover any musical theory. Despite that fact, the course does a great job of teaching every other aspect of writing music, and for someone who has never written any music prior to this course, I am now confident in my writing abilities. It was one of the most wonderful experiences in my life to hear the music I've written come to life, as it was played by several professional musicians who were invited by the teaching staff to play our music. Professor Netzer and Manuela are extremely passionate about what they do and are so helpful. I'd highly recommend this course to anyone interested in learning how to write music, even if you have never written a single note in your life before.</comment>This class allows you to explore writing music, which is awesome. The class started in a more advanced place than expected and the final project was to write a string quartet. I definitely wasn't thinking we would do anything so advanced, but it has been beneficial for me as someone who wants to write music. If you like music, this is a cool elective but it isn't as easy as it appears. If you don't like music, maybe you shouldn't take this course...</comment>This is a fun class where your compositions can be performed by experts. Many basic concepts such as using common tones are covered on how to write a good composition.</comment></course>VES 32v: Volume: Sculpture Course</title>Everyone should take a sculpture class during their time at Harvard. While I wish that I walked away with more technical expertise, I came out of this class with a newfound appreciation for sculpture and manipulation of materials. Overall a really great course!</comment></course>BBS 230: Analysis of the Biological Literature</title>It's a pretty big time commitment but quite valuable. I expected this class to be some sort of "how to read papers" pedantry, but in fact, it proved to be a deep dissection of methods and historical context of a lot of important biology, and was engaging every week.</comment>It isn't necessary to understand every tiny detail of the paper and its method. Don't be afraid to ask questions or try to clear up points of confusion in the faculty session--it is a valid way to participate in the discussion.</comment>Painful but useful learning experience in developing your critical thinking</comment>Very useful and helps develop skills you'll definitely need as a scientist</comment>Read any reviews that include the paper and were released around when the paper was published because they will be helpful in aiding you to understand the paper.</comment>Be thorough in your preparation, it is worth it.</comment>anyone who had prior research experience should not be mandated to take this course</comment>It is a great class to develop skills to better analyze and interpret research articles in biology. It gives you the toolbox with which one can focus more on important aspects of analyzing articles.</comment>It is challenging and frustrating when you aren't interested in the paper topic, but you learn a lot about different parts of biology and become A LOT better at reading papers and interpreting data.</comment>Don't stress out about it. Things will be okay.</comment>Read reviews related to the paper assigned in addition to the paper itself.</comment>Budget tons and tons of time.</comment>I would tell them to not be intimidated by the instructor sessions.</comment>Great way to learn to challenge the literature.</comment>To read a lot of background and discuss well with classmates before attending either of the sections. Be prepared to ask questions.</comment>Take the Tuesday section seriously. I think it is a good outlet to express questions or concerns that will make the Thursday section better.</comment>It's a good class, and you can get as little or as much out of it as you want, depending on what you put in</comment>Please read the papers for Tuesday section and actually come prepared. You don't have to spend 10 hours on each paper, but it's a good idea to try and understand the methods.</comment>This course is all dependent on the faculty that you have and the students who are in your class.</comment>Helps you develop skills to critically apraise literature in a discussion-based manner, which was very effective; also exposes you to a wide variety of literature which is very useful in the future when reading these papers</comment>This is a required course for the BBS program, and is useful in advancing your ability to read the biological literature critically. I think that what you take away from the course is proportional to the amount of effort you put in. Read the papers, look briefly at background material, reviews and accompanying comments and think about the limitations of the paper, techniques and study design if you'd like to fully benefit from the course.

The (Thursday) sessions with faculty are more engaging, as people would have read the papers by then (in addition to participation in these sessions being 50% of the course grade). The Tuesday sessions with the teaching fellows were less productive in terms of the breadth and depth of discussion.

Coursework-wise: there are no weekly assignments - only take-home mid-term and final examinations - these were useful exercises in critical writing on specific papers, though more feedback on these exams would have been beneficial in enhancing the value of the course.</comment>Read papers. It's like vitamins for your brain.</comment>This class teaches you how to read scientific papers critically and talk about science effectively with colleagues.  Both of which are incredibly important skills for a scientist.</comment>Paper-reading is an extremely valuable skill, and so is the ability to introduce yourself to a field. This is a great class for learning these skills, and you also learn a lot of biology.</comment></course>MODGRK A: Elementary Modern Greek</title>The best language class out there.</comment>There's a reason this class consistently keeps receiving good q-guide scores. Such a good language course and Vassiliki is the sweetest!! Really flexible with assignments and makes learning Greek fun. I would highly recommend taking Greek if you're looking for a language or a fun elective.</comment>This is a great class! It is warm, flexible, low stress, and interesting. It is heavily speech-based, with the classes being held mostly in Greek, with little English. Vassiliki is lovely. The only thing to be prepared for is to take initiative yourself for keeping track of assignments etc. because there is some ambiguity about what is due when.</comment>Very good for learning Greek, but is slightly disorganized at times. Make sure you save every single one of your assignments, as you have to turn in a portfolio of all of your work throughout the semester at the end.</comment>This class will give you a great intro to Modern Greek. Professor Rapti is enthusiastic about the course and you practice the vocab you learn a lot so that you retain it.</comment>I would tell anyone interested in learning modern Greek that this class is a great way to begin and introduces a number of different methods of learning (skit dialogues, songs, etc).</comment>This is a great course! It could be a little bit more organized but it's great regardless. Professor Rapti is wonderful and cares about all of her students succeeding.</comment>great course; not much required work, and lenient grading</comment></course>EXPOS 10.004: Introduction to Expository Writing</title>Expos 10 is a great way to improve your writing, providing you with an opportunity to practice different writing techniques with the support of the preceptor.</comment>Expos 10 is a great class for stregnthing your writing skills.</comment>Students should not wait until the day an assignment is done to start working on it.</comment>The professor is amazing. You will not regret taking this class. Your writing improves tremendously as well.</comment>If you are not sure about your writing skills, take this class. Even if you are solid in your writing, take it anyway if you want to fulfill a pre-med requirement by taking Expos 10 and then Expos 20.</comment></course>PHIL 139: Later Heidegger</title>If you're at all interested in Heidegger, you need to take this class.</comment>This class does't only tell you what is the later philosophy of Heidegger, but to teach you think freely with Heidegger, with no constrain of the pre-defined philosophical tradition.</comment>Professor Kelly and Paul the TF were both very genial and approachable. The lectures were fantastic, probably some of the more mindbending sets of lectures I've had as an undergraduate. You'll tackle truth, art, meaning, history, technology and even thinking itself in a way you're most certainly not acclimated too unless you've read Heidegger before. Heidegger is not the sort of system builder or analyst that you've studied in your previous philosophy class. Derivations from some declared "axioms" are really not his thing.  Go to office hours, you'll be able to have some great discussions there.</comment>This is a challenging and wonderful class, and a delightful change-up from the more typical courses offered in our philosophy department.</comment>Heidegger is a scintillating writer and the course subject is hard to wrap your mind around, but ultimately you get to understand one of the great thinkers of the western world.</comment>Heidegger's later writing can seem pretty vague and incomprehensible. But it's worth a read. Professor Kelly is also an excellent lecturer and is so good at making the material more accessible.</comment>Not only is this course a terrific introduction to later Heidegger, it is a good entryway into the history of philosophy--- Professor Kelly does a good job of elucidating Heidegger's place in intellectual history, without getting bogged down or unfairly representing the philosophers Heidegger is building off of.</comment>This course will change your perspective of philosophy! Sean Kelly is a great professor, very friendly and easy to talk to. I loved the course, but it is an advanced course. If you are not very interested in philosophy, this course will be hard to understand and perhaps boring.</comment>Heidegger is magnificent. He will challenge you and madden you, but the insights you glean are well worth it. I have never encountered writing so applicable to living and thinking, in spite of its extreme complexity. Heidegger is indeed transformative. Finally, Professor Kelly is excellent and very willing to work through the texts.</comment>Heidegger is hard, but Prof. Kelly is good at making sense of him. If you would like to learn about Heidegger, you should take this course.</comment></course>CULTR&BLF 53: Sacred and Secular Poetry</title>This is an extremely interesting class on a topic of surprising urgency and relevance. Professor Ryan is an engaging, entertaining, and insightful teacher, and the readings for this class are light (as they're mostly poetry) but deep and well-selected. This class changed the way I think about religion, and introduced me to some pretty great poetry along the way.</comment>I learnt more from this class than any other poetry class I've taken at Harvard. A great introduction to a plethora of new philosophical, religious and literary ideas and movements, but with awesome instructors and without the stress of a hardcore theoretical class.</comment>The poetry in this course is fascinating, and Professor Ryan gives great lectures! I highly recommend it, if you are interested in all forms of spiritual poetry.</comment>I think this class fulfills the role of "general education" pretty well. I learned about cultures/religions and read poems that I otherwise would not have studied. The material was more interesting some weeks than others, but overall I feel the readings were varied and interesting. Exams were reasonable and essays were fairly enjoyable to write.</comment>This course's materials are very interesting, but they are further enlivened by Professor Ryan's lectures. She is obviously very knowledgeable about poetry (especially German poetry) but is still able to convey her knowledge in an engaging manner and in understandable terms to the layman. I learned so much!</comment>interesting but doesn't reach the subject potential</comment></course>ECON 2150: Big Data</title>This is a very interesting course on how to apply machine learning techniques profitably to the social sciences. As the course syllabus states clearly, this is not a technical introduction to machine learning. For that, the best bet is the intro ML classes in the Comp Si dept. Nevertheless, this course is extremely useful. Sendhil gives thought-provoking lectures on ML in the social sciences that I found to be most helpful and, indeed, inspiring. I would enthusiastically recommend this course to anyone in the social sciences who has a good stats background and who wants to apply ML techniques in their research. In the F2014 iteration of this course, the TF (Jann) also gave section lectures that I would heartily recommend as well.</comment>This class is fantastic for thinking outside of the paradigm of current economics methodological thinking. However, it is very much a work in progress. Expect great ideas and interesting methods. Don't expect it to be taught in a structured or coherent way.</comment>This course helps develop a conceptual understanding of big data. Lots of cool research is discussed. Sendhil is fun to listen to, and Jann is a very helpful TF.</comment>The class is new and felt a bit scattered, but it presented useful material and I'm very glad I took it.</comment>Great class if you want a fresh view on econometrics and be exposed to big data problems</comment></course>ENG-SCI 153: Laboratory Electronics</title>Very fast-paced class with lots of material, some of which can be difficult. It's necessary to keep up with the readings because of the fast pace. In terms of material, it is one of the most immediately practical classes I have taken. Covers both analog and digital electronics, which make up all of electronics. Extremely important for any experimental physicist and engineer. It is one of those classes where you get out of it what you put in - labs aren't graded (except small participation grade) and there are no lab write-ups, but they help immensely with your understanding of the electronics. Plus, electronics debugging is a very useful skill.</comment>Take this class. Tom is incredible. Be prepared to spend long hours in lab, but this is by far the best lab you've ever taken. Everyone does the labs not because they're required to, but because that's the only way to learn the material.</comment></course>MATH 229x: Introduction to Analytic Number Theory</title>Analytic number theory is extremely interesting and Arul is a fantastic professor.</comment>It's such an exciting topic, and even if you're more interested in the algebraic stuff (which I currently am), it's still a good gateway into the more abstract stuff (like zeta functions for curves and algebraic analogs of the problems in class) to get your hands dirty with the classical tools and gadgets.</comment>If Arul teaches the class, take it. He is a great lecturer, generates incredible enthusiasm in his students, and he is a preeminent mathematician in the field of Analytic Number Theory. It is absolutely inspiring to take a class with Arul. He is very understanding to students' schedule constraints, and he gives extensions whenever it is necessary. He also makes himself available in his office whenever you need to meet with him. You will learn a lot of modern analytic number theory in this course.</comment></course>VES 115: Printed Matters: Studio Course</title>a super fun, intellectually engaging course!</comment>take it if you're at all interested in studio arts, or just in thinking about what images are especially in the time of the laser printer. 6 hour class is a challenge, but fosters a great community -- I made a number of good friends through this course. Matt is great - go to his office hours and seek him out one-on-one.</comment>Come into this class ready to be creative! Matt is wonderful (and Sally was an incredible TF) and they helped both with technical elements of the course and pushing ourselves to grow. You don't need to have art experience for this class, however you absolutely should not think this course doesn't allow artistic skills to grow!</comment>Fantastic course that should not be overlooked. The amazing introduction to a wide range of printmaking techniques, the opportunity to work with a new range of media and materials, and with the wonderful Matt Saunders, all make this course perfect for those with any interest in art. I came away with a huge amount of new knowledge of prints--what different types of prints actually are, how they are made, and how to look about them, as well as a new conceptual understanding of the function of "printed matter" in the world, and specific artmaking skills. So much fun, so interesting, and so many open-ended opportunities to experiment and pursue what you are interested in!</comment>Matt teaches you both the technical aspect of printing and the conceptual motivations behind it. He does a great job of tying everything in and making the class feel like a whole body of knowledge.</comment>This class was amazing, and one of the best things I've done at Harvard. I'm not an art person my any means, but I loved the course. We got to do pretty much anything we were interested in for the final project, which was really exciting. Matt is wonderful, and gives great and constructive critiques on even awful art. We went to NYC for an art fair, and it was amazing to see what good artists can do with the techniques we were learning in class. Printmaking is an awesome art form, Matt is the best, so definitely take the class. And if Sally is still TFing, you would be the luckiest, because she is the most on top of her stuff, and so helpful and kind.</comment>This class is amazing. I could not recommend it with more enthusiasm. Its a lot of work but the results are rewarding! As long as you dont go into a project intending to fudge your way through, you will do great!</comment>This course is a lot of fun! You get to try so many different printing techniques, including lithography, intaglio, letterpress, and digital prints. It is very open-ended, which can be challenging at times because you have so much flexibility that it's sometimes hard to think of solid projects to pursue. Matt and Sally are great teachers and I really appreciated their feedback. I felt like I learned a lot, and am glad I took it as an elective. However, it is a huge time commitment, especially at the end of the semester because of the final project. All in all, a wonderful class and should be taken by anyone even if you're not VES!</comment></course>PORTUG Ac: Beginning Portuguese for Spanish Speakers I</title>This class was very Brazilian - great people and super fun, but also super disorganized.</comment>If you speak Spanish and want to learn another Romance language, TAKE THIS COURSE. You won't find a better stepping stone into another foreign language.</comment>This is a great course! If you want to learn Portuguese and have a Spanish background definitely take this over Port Aa. You don't need to be an amazing Spanish speaker just knowing the grammatical structure of romance languages will help. If anything knowing Spanish pronunciations make it a bit harder to learnt the Portuguese ones. GREAT class and Viviane is an amazing teacher I highly recommend it.</comment>I would tell them to supplement the in-class portion of this course with exposure to the language outside of class.</comment>The course with Prof. Legg is excellent. You will learn and enjoy at the same time. It will take around 2-3 hours of your week for doing the assignments but is worthy.</comment>Great class for learning Portuguese.</comment>Make sure you and your classmates are on the same page with assignments</comment>This was a great class that gave me a solid introduction to the similarities, and more importantly, the differences between Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese. The activities all had a clear purpose and contributed toward skill development in the class. Exams can be difficult so prepare accordingly.</comment>I took this class for a fun elective.  If that's why you want to take this class, I wouldn't recommend it.  Our preceptor did a good job of engaging the class and making you feel comfortable participating, but the organization of the class was crippling.  The hardest part of the homework was figuring out what we had to do on the iSite, which shouldn't be the case.  Assignments would be in random places on the site or not on there at all.  It was also unclear what was actually being graded.  "Oral tasks," for example, made up a large portion of your grade (according to the syllabus), but I did not receive a grade on a single one out of about seven tasks.  In-class activities, too, could be difficult to decipher.  We would get about one minute to complete some task, and I would spend all or most of it trying to figure out what to do, which resulted in a lot less time practicing Portuguese.
We politely alerted the course head (also our teacher) that the iSite was a mess, and she got annoyed and defensive, essentially refusing to fix it.  I found this to be unprofessional.  The course did have its exciting moments and I did learn some Portuguese, but in its current state, it brought more unneeded stress than it was worth.</comment>If you take this class, you will basically get what you put in. You will not be pushed to learned the language as the assignments and tests are doable even without knowing everything or studying too much. If you really want to learn the language though you will have to do some self study. Overall, I think is a fun class and if you get involved in all of the outside activities you will definitely acquire the language faster.</comment>This class is somewhat disorganized and doesn't go exactly by the syllabus. I had to do a lot of outside work to feel comfortable with the material - the pace seemed frenetic most classes. The utilization of iSites was below average, and it wasn't always clear what assignments were due when. 

Overall, this course wasn't the best introduction to Portuguese I think I could've had, but you learn a lot in any case. I think that this has potential to be an amazing class, just a little more organized and it'd be great. I would still strongly recommend if you're interested in Portuguese because Viviane is truly dedicated.</comment>Great class. Took it as an elective and feel like I can converse in portuguese after a semester.</comment>This class has a perfect balance of workload and enough engagement to really get you learning the language.</comment>Do not take this as a relaxing course and to just learn the language. The course take more time and there is a lot of busy work.</comment>Not the pleasant learning experience that I had hoped for. Needlessly stressful and time consuming. Extremely disorganized; last minute assignments and inconvenient final project. Assignments were returned very late. Costs may outweigh the benefits in taking Ac over Aa. 
Despite these frustrations, this course has tremendous potential. I am hopeful that it will be restructured significantly and make for a better learning experience next year.</comment>TAKE THIS COURSE!!! (Workload ~ 3 hours outside class/week) I knew going into it that my Spanish wasn't at the level of the other students but that didn't stop me. This class is super manageable, and despite the high workload ratings, it isn't tedious like other languages might be, and doesn't really seem like work. Furthermore, you CAN ACTUALLY BE CONVERSATIONAL WITH NATIVE SPEAKERS if you try hard enough- you get out what you put in.</comment>best language class i've ever taken, hands down.</comment>Benedict Cruz is one of the coolest people youll meet here.</comment>All of the TF's are very supportive; I really recommend learning Portuguese because it opens you up to an incredible culture, including a very friendly group at Harvard.</comment>I would recommend the course because it was great and has issues that can be easily fixed.</comment>It's very good, dynamic and fun. It is also more work than you would expect for a language class</comment>More work and harder than I thought the class would be. Viviane was fun and caring, but at times I got frustrated with all of the work and lack of organization.</comment>The professor is enthusiastic and makes class exciting, but the course lacks organization. This may change, however, as the professor fine-tunes her course design.</comment>It's a good class. You'll get even more out of it if you put in the time to understand and study the material outside of class, particularly the vocab.</comment></course>ARABIC 131a: Upper-Level Modern Arabic l</title>Definitely take this class!!!! It's amazing. Nevenka is the best Arabic teacher you'll ever have. The class focuses on current events and controversial issues. It teaches you how to have meaningful conversations on complex issues. Grammar and vocab are woven into class. I also learned more about the Middle East and current issues than I did in my class on the Middle East.</comment>Take it, it's great.</comment>Ustaza Nevenka is probably one of the best teachers I've had at Harvard. She genuinely cares about all her students, and even if you're not the most confident in your Arabic ability, she always there to support and encourage you. Although there's a good amount of work every day, it's pretty manageable and even enjoyable a lot of the time. If you're on the fence about taking this class, I would definitely recommend going for it!</comment>If you want to learn Arabic, take this course. Ustaaza Nevenka is fabulous, she generates true enthusiasm for the subject matter, she is excellent at explaining difficult grammar concepts, and she is very easy-going and willing to help if there is a problem.</comment>This class really felt like the point where things started to "pay off" after investing as much in Arabic as I (and presumably you) had two years in. Lots of interesting and very manageable readings, meaningful discussions, and a real sense that we were actively using the language. Nevenka is a phenomenal professor who explains things clearly and carefully and is also one of the nicest people I have ever met. Great, great course--you should be excited to take it after Arabic A and B.</comment>I think it's a good course to take if you want to learn more vocabulary that you might see in news articles or that might pertain to world affairs. However, there is a good amount of work one has to put in outside of class.</comment>Nevenka is amazing and very helpful, regardless of your level of fluency.</comment>This Arabic is a breath of FRESH AIR coming from second-year Arabic. There's no constant inculcation of grammar concepts and nitpicking on every case ending as was in Arabic 2. Instead, you come to class and have discussions all the time. Your speaking will improve tremendously if you make any effort and tests are much easier than last year. They are focused more on incorporating vocabulary rather than grammar rules.</comment>This class will make you feel so good about how much you've learned already. It is super helpful at improving your ability to actually use the language rather than drilling certain grammar concepts. And the enthusiasm of the teaching staff is contagious. Class is FUN.</comment>Push yourself and really make the effort to be in Nevenka's class.</comment>that even though taking Arabic at Harvard is daunting, getting to the third year is worth it</comment>Take third year Arabic with Nevenka!</comment>This course is much more interesting than Arabic B. The course materials are interesting, relevant, and not from the 1980s (unlike Al Kitaab). Ustaadha Navenka is a great teacher, with a wide knowledge not just of the language, but also about all the topics that came up in our class discussions. She has a great ability to precisely define words, and knows when a translation isn't quite perfect.</comment>OMG THIS CLASS IS THE BEST. ITS EMPHASIS ON CURRENT EVENTS IS A REFRESHING CHANGE FROM ARABIC B AND MAKES YOUR ARABIC FUNCTIONAL FOR DAY-TO-DAY USE. PLUS IF YOU GRADUATE FROM HARVARD ARABIC WITHOUT MEETING NAVENKA YOU ARE DOING YOURSELF A DISSERVICE. SHE IS THE LIFE OF THE COURSE AND HER METICULOUSLY PLANNED COURSE IS SUCH A PLEASURE.</comment>Nevenca is probably one of my favorite professors I have had at Harvard. Not only is she super engaging, but also she cares about everyone one of her students, and is very conscious about when they are feeling overwhelmed. The class if fully in arabic, which scared me at first, but helped me advance even further in my studies of arabic. If you are considering dropping Arabic after Arabic Bb, at least give this class a shot in the first semester, you won't regret it! One Caveat: lots of work, be prepared for that.</comment>The class is really interesting and you get to form your own opinions about lots of controversial modern issues. Nevenka is SO kind and supportive. However, if you are taking this as your 5th semester of Arabic and have never studied abroad or gone to Arabic language camp you WILL be below average. Many graduate students take this class who speak Arabic proficiently.</comment>It's hard work, but it's very worth it:  Dr. Nevenka will make your Arabic immeasurably better.</comment></course>PSY 2570r: Intergroup Relations: Research Seminar</title>Very repetitive but always have to be on your toes when you're doing it.</comment></course>MCB 291: Genetics, Genomics and Evolutionary Biology</title>This is a good course, but it will be confusing, and one should go in with some knowledge of genetics, and expect to have to use outside resources/meet with the professors to understand the lecture material.</comment>It's more like a survey of everything mildly related to genetics/evolution, including history of the field so if you want to learn very in depth things about modern genetics take a different upper level course</comment>This is a great course to gain expertise with a modern perspective literally from Darwin to Next Generation Sequencing. I got a solid foundation for experimental design and clear utility of modern techniques as applied to answering fundamental questions. Workload is mainly problem sets and journal article readings for section and otherwise, definitely doable. Problem sets always involve quantitative approach to genetics, encouraging a strong fundamental understanding.</comment>If you do not have a good genetics background, you may be exposed to a lot of material in this course, but mastery in any parts of the course is unlikely to happen due to the pace and depth of teaching</comment></course>PHYSICS 95: Topics in Current Research</title>It is a great, relaxed class. IF you are considering grad school for physics or you just want to get a better understanding of actual topics currently being researched this is a great class for you.</comment>A must-take class for all physics concentrators. I learned a lot of physics!! This class was a great way to learn about the different fields of physics and get a sense of what physics research is like. This class is very little work, and is a great fourth (or fifth) class (although this could depend on the professor). You'll get more out of this if you've taken 143a.</comment>This class is absolutely perfect. You learn about the cutting edge of a huge variety of fields, get a sense of what sort of work people do at Harvard, hone your presentation skills, hang out in small groups with lots of faculty, and get lots of free food. You legitimately learn a lot every week, and even though the weeks of presentations are a bit stressful, I really liked those ones because I felt like I understood the material much better than in other weeks. Highly recommend for juniors especially.</comment></course>FRENCH 40: Upper-level French I: The Contemporary Francophone World Through Cinema</title>This course is good if you want to get accustomed to HEARING French, but it may not necessarily be one that pushes you into the realm of fluency if that's what you're looking for. You have to be willing to speak up in class in order to practice your own speaking as well as be able to organize the grammatical concepts in your own mind so when it comes time for exams, you are not trying to learn everything on the spot. In regards to pacing yourself, you should be doing that with the work in this course as well; it's not difficult, but you should supplement the movie watching and assignments with reading French articles on your own and listening to radio so that you become more comfortable with it. In one sentence, I would say that in order to succeed in this class, you have to take your learning into your own hands and go about meeting your own personal goals as opposed to focusing on the levels of other students in the class.</comment>I would say to not take the course in the morning. It was a bit tough to get through.</comment>Get to know your class and get involved in the discussions.</comment>The class was great, and definitely one of the lightest on my schedule, but I found myself often bored with the assignments and the conversation. If you think you can handle anything more difficult, take 55 or something higher. Dr. Chevant is incredible, and I'd highly recommend her for any other course, but this one in particular was more valuable for the films we watched than for what we 'learned.'</comment>Make sure you watch the films!</comment>It's a great class if, like me, your high school French classes were not that great and especially if you have had little exposure to writing or speaking in French. The movies are great, the professor is great, and although there is a lot of small work to do constantly, it's a relatively low-stress class. I feel that French 40 prepared me well to take my next steps in learning French.</comment>This class is more interesting and less work than most other french classes at Harvard.</comment>Great class!!!! Dr. Chevant was amazing.  Led a really fun class with good group discussions.  Assignments are completely fair and it is very clear what is expected of you for each assignment.  Tests are fair and she will give you as much help with the papers as you need as long as you seek it out!  The group projects can be a little tedious, but really helped bond our class and make for a fun class overall.</comment>The class does little to advance spoken French, although you do learn written structures.</comment>This is a fun class to take but it is not really a lot about film. Perhaps I was mistaken thinking there would be a lot of film study but this is really simply french language through film.</comment>A good class to take to fulfill french requirements</comment>Dr. Chevant is an amazing professor. Definitely try to get into her section for the class because she is very helpful and truly wants to help her students succeed. Always take your compositions to her before they're due and she'll help you out with grammar. Basically a really fun class with not too much work. Highly recommend.</comment>The class itself requires a lot of work, especially writing in French. It quickly and greatly improved both my oral and written French, and the grammar is definitely a welcome refresher. There are some movies I really enjoyed and others that I did not enjoy as much, but overall it is a wonderful class.</comment>This is an interesting class, especially if you like the French cinema and like to analyze French films while discussing important contemporary French issues regarding art, politics, family life etc.  However, be aware that this class has a lot of homework and a moderately heavy work load, so you need to spend a lot of time on it. However, it is totally worth it as your listening, writing and speaking abilities in French will definitely improve.</comment></course>SPANSH 201: Historia de la lengua espanola</title>Professor Giron Negron is one of the most genuine and smartest professors I have ever had. You can tell how much he loves what he is teaching and it's amazing to be able to learn from him. Make sure to do the readings as it will help reinforce the concepts learned in class.</comment>There's a lot you need to know to start this class, Spanish, maybe Latin, but the class itself isn't too hard. And it's so much fun!</comment>That they'll learn a lot but that they have to motivate themselves very much because there are no tests or assignments holding an axe over their heads.</comment>Low workload, interesting topic, excellent professor</comment></course>ASTRON 98: Research Tutorial in Astrophysics</title>If you are interested in astronomy and are a concentrator or secondary, then lucky you--this class is the department's present to you. The discussions at lunch are genuinely some of the best experiences I've had at Harvard, with amazing conversations on all manner of subjects. Plus, if you're new to research this is a really helpful way to get you started in a relatively low-pressure way where there's a lot of support available. And if you have done research before then you can make this as serious of a project as you want. Really an incredible class.</comment>This is a great course for anyone interested in astronomy research. The best advice I can give is to choose a project that 1) you think is interesting and 2) is going to be supervised by someone you get along well with. It's so vital that you and your supervisor communicate well with one another. Because there are a lot of different projects to choose from, recognize that some projects are significantly harder than others and you only really have a very limited amount of time to work on them!</comment>Be careful who you choose to be your advisor</comment>This is a great introduction to astronomy research and the field in general. Definitely take it to develop necessary skills and to see what research is like.</comment>This was one of the better courses I've taken at Harvard. I really enjoyed the weekly lunches with different professors in the department. In terms of the research project, it really is up to you to stay on top of your work. It helps to have an advisor that's engaged and available to meet frequently. If you manage your time well, the course is extremely manageable.</comment></course>HISTSCI 298v: Media, Method, and Practice</title>Even without the practice component, which is what you make of it, a really comprehensive guide to media theory and the digital humanities debate. And you can do amazing things in the practice component.</comment></course>PSY 2436r: Social Neuroscience and Psychopathology Laboratory</title>If you're looking to write a thesis, there are probably better Principal Investigators to work with. If you are looking to simply gain more research experience, this is a great lab. A little disorganized but you get a good sense of what research is like. Definitely ask before starting what your responsibilities as an undergraduate research assistant would be since it varies dramatically based on what stage they are at in their projects (e.g. recruitment may involve calling and screening families, running subjects may involve a lot of working with subjects and administering questionnaires, but if the project is over data analysis might not be your cup of tea).</comment></course>ENGLISH 90bc: Black Global Cities: Seminar</title>Marina's really great, the readings are amazing.</comment>I had never taken an English class, so understandably I was a bit nervous about what this would entail. All in all a wonderful class! Readings were great, assignments were actually enjoyable, class discussions were always fun, and instructor was wonderful: very helpful and just a genuinely great person. I would definitely recommend taking this class, or anything else Marina teaches!</comment></course>MUSIC 97c: Music History and Repertory: Music in Cross-Cultural Perspective</title>This class challenged me to look closely at music that I perhaps might not have been exposed to. I really enjoyed this class because it gave me a lot of new music to explore and taught me a method of close listening that I can apply to all of the music I love and my future research methods.</comment>Overall, the course is great but a little fragmented because its such a broad field. You only cover three regions of the world, which is understandable. It does well for what it is: an introduction to ethnomusicology. As for homework, you'll have weekly listening guides which are totally doable and fair. Two of the three meetings a week are generally very small sections, which is nice and invites subtle pressure to always be prepared--as you can get through lectures without reading/listening. Lectures and sections have nice multimedia components.</comment>Professor Shelemay is amazing.</comment>From what I've heard (and from my own perception) 97c is the best it's been in years. It really helped me to realize that I'm a ethnomusicology person, and not many other courses in the dept allow you to do that kind of exploration. It's also just a great break/adventure from Western classical theory. The staff and Prof. Shelemay are all experts in some field, so that sort of exposure and opportunity is great.</comment>it's important to see music beyond the basic Western musical tradition, and this class does a great job of establishing some traditions to look at from a different perspective.</comment>Don't put your listening guides off to the last minute.</comment>this was a really fun class, and will expand your appreciation and listening of music across the board. Professor Shelemay is at the top in her field, and she is a great lecturer and person. Definitely take the time to get to know her. The TFs are also great, and each brought their own musical perspective to offer to the class.</comment>This course was a lot of work (I imagine you'll get the gist of that from the other comments), and a lot of the work seemed to be a bit needless. With that said, however, I think it's important to say that the course as a whole—lectures, sections, videos, etc.—was rewarding. The TFs and Professor Shelemay were extremely knowledgeable and well-informed, and the discussions in the course were refreshingly engaging and relevant. If you already have a tough course schedule, then maybe avoid this class, but if you're prepared for the workload, you will enjoy it. From my experience, it is definitely better overall than the other 97s.</comment>It is literally the most amazing class at Harvard.  Professor Shellemay creates a syllabus that provides the students with unforgettable experiences.  If you are at all interested in music, this is definitely a class to take.</comment>Eye-opening course into a different body of music - Ethiopian chant, Balinese gamelan, and Middle Eastern song. The assignments could be improved significantly through a more structured introduction to the different components of each musical culture. But the trips are really enjoyable and Professor Shelemay is a fantastic resource and an enthusiastic lecturer.</comment></course>FRSEMR 24q: Biology of Symbiosis: Living Together Can Be Fun!</title>This is the coolest freshman seminar! I learned a lot and had a great time. The field trips were very fun, and since the class size was small, we all formed a nice community. Professor Cavanaugh is very, very nice and caring, and she makes sure you understand what is being taught. She also had snacks for us, all the time—pizza, guac, chips, celery—and used a lot of didactic materials that were fun to observe and use!</comment>Professor Cavanaugh is incredible- extremely personable, helpful, and intelligent. By far my favorite and most rewarding class of freshman fall. Large amounts of reading concerning microbial symbioses so a interest in the subject material is necessary. Her enthusiasm with the subject material has influenced my thoughts on future career path in science.</comment>If you are looking for an interesting seminar with an amazing professor, this is it! Professor Cavanaugh is great, and will teach you a lot about microbiology!</comment>Awesome seminar, awesome professor! If you have an interest in biology, I would definitely recommend it!</comment>You will enjoy this class if you are interested in essentially any field of biology and have some innate curiosity about how life works.</comment>Choosing to take this course was perhaps the best decision when it came to deciding to take a seminar. It was fun (especially the field trips to the BHI, Aquarium, and Broad Institute), informative, and engaging. Perhaps most importantly it introduced me to some of my closest friends on campus and through this course I got to know one of the most intelligent and friendly professors on campus.</comment>Definitely take this course! Professor Cavanaugh is so enthusiastic about this course. She has done so much, you'll be amazed. Like, the day after our papers were do, she was going to the White House for a meeting...like how crazy is that! She makes class fun, but definitely make sure you do all the readings and take notes...that's what the basis of the class discussions are on, and since class only meets once a week, you don't wanna be left out.</comment>Professor Cavanaugh is an amazing teacher and really, really cares about the material she teaches and her students.  I am so glad she was able to start this freshman seminar.  I was already interested in the material to begin with, but I have delved more into symbioses and learned more about these relationships in an incredibly fun way.  
Professor Cavanaugh is incredibly accomplished in her field, and she truly enjoys what she teaches- it comes through in the class.  She incorporates fun trips and interesting talks into the curriculum as well.</comment>It is very fun, not stressful, and incredibly interesting.  Dr. Cavanaugh is a joy to learn from, not to mention a brilliant scientist, and you will learn a lot from the readings, lectures, and just being around her!</comment></course>ENG-SCI 95r: Startup R & D</title>Paul Bottino is amazing. He has helped encourage so many students to pursur their entrepreneurial dreams.</comment>This is a great class. While it might not offer all of the concrete backing you might be looking for to help guide the creation of your startup, it will provide you with an environment to solidify your ideas and talk with like minded people. Overall this is a great class if you want to pursue a startup of any kind.</comment>It is a great experience but only do this class if you are actually going to work on your start-up. Try to take step forwards and listen to the feedback from Mr. Bottino because it is very helpful.</comment>Startup R&D is a great opportunity to work on a start-up and get great advice.</comment>Take class if you need the extra time to work on a project</comment>Gave me the mental space to dedicate more time to my start up and make some real progress this semester.  I spent a huge number of hours a week working on "this course" but what that really means is that I was working on my start up. All the work for this class were things that I needed to be doing for my business anyway (e.g. putting together a pitch). It was also really exciting to be in a class with other students working on start ups who could relate to the thoughts/feelings/emotions I was going through.</comment>This is a fantastic class if you have a startup idea and want to have a structured space and time to let it take off</comment>This course is a good for giving you time to work on a startup. You sacrifice 2 hours a week to useless activities in the classroom, but get to work on your startup otherwise.</comment>If you are pursuing or wish to pursue a startup idea, this is a wonderful forum to do so.  Professor Bottino is a really awesome professor and he really cares about you and your startup.  For me, ES95 was a great class because I was already doing all the work needed for the class before taking it.  Highly recommended to anyone interested in pursuing their own idea.</comment>If you have a startup, its nice that this course takes up an academic to work on it.</comment>Bottino is amazing and will provide the guidance and advice you need when things are going smoothly or not quite so smoothly</comment>An easy class, yes, with absolutely no assignments. But an incredibly valuable one too.</comment>If you are passionate about starting a company and very self driven then this is the perfect class for you.</comment>Awesome opportunity, but you have to really care about your idea. You'll get out what you put in. Work hard ~ at least ten hours a week, and you'll do well.</comment>If you've got a startup that you're truly serious about working on, this is the class for you! You'll get excellent advice from both your peers and Mr. Bottino, and the class has pretty much no workload so you'll get extra time to work on your startup!</comment>This is the best course I've ever taken at Harvard, hands-down and bar none. The fact that it exists is a testament to the excellence of Paul Bottino as an instructor and mentor, and every student with even the slightest inclination toward entrepreneurship should seriously consider joining Startup R&D. It's more than a class-- it's an unparalleled opportunity to do something incredible with your undergraduate education. If you're in doubt, go for it.</comment>1.  If you want to work on a startup while at Harvard, take this course.

3.  If you followed 2, then refer to 1.</comment>thought some of the meetings were not super productive and kind of a waste of time, but it was nice talking with other students who were facing similar problems with their ventures.</comment></course>E-PSCI 239: The Consequences of Energy Systems</title>Do go in with an open mind to discussion anything and everything.</comment>Good course that imparts wide knowledge on climate change, and how various energy systems affect the environment</comment>great for fulfilling a requirement. limited course-work and only one graded assignment. for those hoping to gain an in-depth scientific understanding (graduate level) of climate change should look elsewhere. However, if you put in a lot of time and effort into the final project, you'll learn a TON about energy technologies and energy resources.</comment>Excellent overview of climate system, climate change, and energy systems. Good starting point if you're interested in those issues. Not too much work except for final paper.</comment>Take seriously the final assignment. The exercise is truly transformative.</comment>Excellent overview of many aspects of the climate problem. Does not go into much depth.</comment></course>ENGLISH 177: American Law, Race, and Narrative</title>I do not think courses like this are offered enough at Harvard. This kind of thinking--about constructions of race in US society--should be required of all students.</comment>Prof. Bilbija lucidly discusses and. Working with her you'll learn how to express yourself clearly and concisely both in essays and in discussion; you'll also be exposed to a whole slew of scholarly debates about the texts that were relevant pre-Civil War and are still relevant now. The class definitely leans literary, with not so many legal texts, and the readings can often be difficult to get through simply because they're sort of old literary works. All in all, though, this course thoroughly covers a lot of literature that's overlooked or underappreciated. Would recommend!</comment>Great class for hist & lit students looking to fulfill the multicultural lit requirement or anyone who is interested in literature that deals with race & freedom in the US. It was a great exercise in close-reading texts and discussing them in an intimate setting. Marina is very knowledgeable and approachable; though the writing assignments are rigorous, there are many opportunities to seek feedback on drafts which will improve your writing (and grade) overall. Be prepared to do a significant amount of reading.</comment></course>GOV 94jb: Secrecy and Transparency</title>This is probably the best course I've taken at Harvard. It is a very interesting topic that is relevant to today's current issues of government secrecy and transparency. Jonathan does a great job of keeping everyone engaged by having us do fun debates, bringing in visiting professors to talk, and talking in small groups.</comment>Take this class! Take it take it take!!! It is so much fun, and Jonathan is absolutely amazing. You will walk out having learned so much more about the government and the direction in which the world is heading at the moment. Moreover, the readings are fun and the subject is very interesting and relevant!!!</comment>A very interesting class that has to do with real and current events and problems within the US Government.</comment>Jonathan is a sweetheart and very encouraging. The topic is also extremely relevant to current day problems in the US government. I think it's a really important class to take for everyone who may be interested in being in the government but also who may be interested in reform. This class demonstrates that there are serious complexities to using just "transparency" or "national security" as a response to anything and perhaps, everything.</comment></course>PSY 1352: Foundations of Cognitive Neuroscience Research</title>The readings were interesting and provided good background knowledge for the discussion meetings. Taking a closer look into methodology was interesting to me and something I hadn't thought very much about previously. Professor Buckner is very knowledgable on the topics, encourages questions/discussion, and was very approachable regarding the course materials and other related questions in general. I really liked the structure of the discussions, and found Professor Buckner engaging and approachable.</comment></course>SOCIOL 243: Economic Sociology</title>I would recommend this course with reservations. Because economic sociology is such a vast field, it is likely that the course taker would have to read materials which is not really her substantive interests. But I would recommend it if my peer is interested in learning traditional concepts frequently used in sociology.</comment>It is a very informative course and good introduction to economic sociology.</comment></course>SANSKRIT 200ar: Advanced Poetic Sanskrit</title>If you love poetry and are interested what precolonial India had to say about poetics, then this course will be an ocean of bliss! "The Joy of the Waterlily" of Apayya is exactly for curious children like us.</comment></course>SCI-LIVSYS 22: Human Influence on Life in the Sea</title>The laboratory reports are quite an amount of work. Be prepared. But then again, there are only three.</comment>This is a good class, the topic is important and while not all lectures are super interesting some are. There is no weekly reading and the assignments are graded pretty easily so I'd say its a good SLS gen ed.</comment>It's not easy, but if you like the material you will love the class.</comment>This is a great class. It requires very little of you except to show up and pay attention, and the content is fascinating if you do choose to engage during lectures. Would recommend.</comment>Terrible class and not at all the easy, interesting science GenEd that I was hoping for. Was miserable the entire time: not only were the assignments tediously graded but also just totally worthless feeling and a waste of my time. It was infuriating to spend so many hours on the lab reports, not knowing what I was shooting for, and then to get a bad grade.</comment>If you're passionate about environmentalism and the oceans, this class is a great introduction to the subject matter.  The professors are both talented and accessible, and the workload is relatively manageable.  Be prepared to sift through a large volume of material when preparing for tests, however; the course covers a lot of seemingly random subjects and it can be difficult to determine what you'll be expected to know.  Make sure to attend review sessions, because Shelbi (the TF) does a great job of dissecting lectures and getting to the concepts that really matter. In general, the course really emphasizes applying knowledge to real world problems, which is great for those interested in climate issues but also requires a decent amount of preparation.  Overall, though, it's not difficult to do well in this course if you utilize the resources available, and you'll come away with a much better understanding of climate science and policy!</comment>There is no homework and the subject matter is interesting but it is hard to study for the test from just slides and your class notes.  It is hard to tell what information they give you is important and what is not important.</comment>This was a very interesting course, with cool labs and sections. I enjoyed the material, but the way it was presented in lecture was a little difficult to understand sometimes, so in order to be successful you need to take full advantage of asking questions.</comment>This course was a great introduction to the global ocean systems and how humans are changing them. Lectures cover a wide range of topics, and provide interesting case studies. Some topics are certainly more interesting than others, but overall a good understanding of the basics of the oceans and their relationship to climate change is provided.</comment>This class is a real gem.  If you are interested in the marine realm at all definitely take this class.  The work load is not demanding at all as it offers the perfect amount of work that is necessary to qualify this class as a Gen Ed.  Also the lectures are very interesting and this is due to the extensive experience that both professors have in the field.</comment>This is a good GenEd to take for SLS if you want to avoid math/chem and are interested in the effects of climate change. It will take quite a bit of studying outside of class, but the TF and the professors are always willing to explain the material outside of class if you need help. The assignments are definitely do-able, and the labs are often shorter than the two-hour blocks allotted for them.</comment></course>WELSH 225a: Medieval Welsh Language and Literature</title>Even though this is a Graduate-level seminar, interested undergraduates should feel free to contact Prof. McKenna to take the class. It was a great group of people, and I learned a lot about, not just Medieval Welsh, but life outside our Harvard bubble.</comment></course>PLSH A: Elementary Polish</title>This course is fair and rewarding, but if you take it as a heritage student, Pani Baranczak expects a lot more of you. You will definitely learn a lot.</comment></course>MATH 231a: Algebraic Topology</title>Professor Hopkins is one of the best algebraic topologist in the world. His insight on how to see the homology and cohomology group really helps you to gain a solid understanding of the subject. His design on problem set, though easy, is often extremely thoughtful and worth some exploration. I would highly recommend this class to anyone who is interested in topology.</comment>Be sure to read the corresponding part in the textbook in order to follow the class.</comment>Hopkins is a rock star topologist, so taking this course from him was awesome. Don't miss a chance to learn topology from him.</comment>pretty standard first semester algebraic topology course, from an exceptional professor. mike hopkins is a legend</comment>Mike clearly knows a lot about the subject, but on the other hand he doesn't give the cleanest presentation of the material, so be prepared to clarify some stuff on you own / go to OHs</comment>This course provides a decent introduction to algebraic topology. Mike Hopkins is a very nice guy, and he's absolutely hilarious during lecture. Nevertheless, he is a poor lecturer and often comes to class unprepared. He's disorganized when he teaches, and he rambles on about topics that either aren't related or are related but he never explains why. His problem sets are long, hard, and often riddled with mistakes. Take this class at your own risk.</comment>Hopkins' math 231a is quite fun.  To learn the material, I had to basically read Hatcher on my own, as Hopkins' lectures tend to be rather disorganized, but the lectures were mighty fun nonetheless.</comment>If you want to actually learn the material well and keep up, you should be prepared to do a lot of work on your own.</comment>Prof. Hopkins is a great lecturer, though appeared somewhat disorganized. Nevertheless I would recommend the class. There is a fair amount of work due to the length of the problem sets, but it's generally not terrible.</comment>Take it. Algebraic topology is just wicked cool. Hopkins is a bit disorganized, but still great. Very funny, and he knows the subject better than anyone. It's the kind of thing where, if I become a math professor years from now, I will name drop and say "I got to take algebraic topology with Mike Hopkins".</comment>Algebraic topology is a fascinating subject and its ability to produce easy and elegant proofs to difficult claims seems somewhat magical. It really puts the material from your point-set topology in context, which can often be dry when learned on its own. That said, algebraic topology take a while to get the hang of. The first few weeks just seem like arbitrary constructions, and only a few weeks in does the theory of homology start coming together and making sense. Mike Hopkins is a great guy and very amusing to listen to. However, he seemed a lot more focused on his research this semester and frequently came to class unprepared, which made lectures quite disorganized.</comment>If you are considering taking a graduate math class, reviews probably will not sway you much either way. But I can say that Hopkins is both an informative and hilarious lecturer, and I enjoyed his problem sets.</comment>The second half of this course depends heavily on who is teaching it.  In the first half, we derive fundamental results in algebraic topology in a methodical manner, but the professor has much more freedom in the second half to study topics he finds interesting.  This course also provides a good introduction to category theory and some aspects of homological algebra.</comment>Mike is a great lecturer, this is a great class, and algebraic topology is very cool.</comment>I think Professor Hopkins made this course a bit easier than it could have been, which might be a good thing, but I also think that as a result, I don't understand the material as well as I could have. As is usual for graduate classes, you'll get out exactly what you put into it.</comment></course>PORTUG Aa: Beginning Portuguese I</title>As a student who had taken 6 years of Latin from middle to high school, I was at a slight disadvantage from the onset of this class. I originally shopped Spanish Aa and French Aa, but I found that the students in those classes had taken those respective languages for as long as I'd taken Latin, which is completely unfair and shouldn't be allowed. Portuguese, I figured, is a class not offered very often at the high school level, so the students in it would all be starting at the same point. That said, those students who had taken Spanish (which was 6 out of 8 people in my class) had a definite advantage over me. Still, it was a great class, and I'm definitely glad I took it.</comment>This was definitely one of my favorite classes. The Portuguese department is a great community that'll provide you with opportunities to travel to Brazil or a Thursday night workshop in samba dancing. This class was challenging but not stressful. The assignments aren't too difficult but you may get more than one each night. It seems like busywork but the continual practice keeps you from forgetting material. If you're serious about learning Portuguese it provides a great foundation in only a few months. I came in with zero knowledge of Portuguese but now I'm able to have simple conversations and I feel confident about traveling to Brazil this J-term.</comment>It's a great class and the teacher is excellent! The workload is not spaced out that evenly throughout the term, but it's not unmanageable, and for the most part is very fun.</comment>This class is a great intro to Portuguese class. It's very accessible and allows you to learn a new language almost seamlessly.</comment>This is an AMAZING class. Bené is wonderful, and you learn so much! The tests are reasonable and infrequent, and the final project is lots of fun.</comment></course>ENGLISH Chcr: Advanced Poetry: Workshop</title>one of the best classes you will take at Harvard, period.</comment>The best class I've taken at Harvard. Josh is amazing and his feedback is always super helpful. It's just a must take class if you are at all serious about developing your poetry even more.</comment>One of my favorite classes I've taken at Harvard. Josh is incredibly approachable, helpful, and intelligent.</comment>This course rocks. If you want to be surrounded by very smart and extraordinarily talented peers in a compassionate and creative environment, take this class! Josh is a laid back but profoundly smart workshop leader who heads the charge with commentary that is critical while also sensitive and extremely respectful of the intent of the work. Take it!</comment>If you can take it, take it. Josh will make you believe in your poetry, not in an unrealistic candyland way but in a realistic, hard-won-triumphs way. Come sharpen your verbal sword. Or no, wield that sword, and learn to do it confidently.</comment></course>SOCIOL 98Wc: Sports and Society</title>The material was extremely interesting and relevant to anyone with an interest in sports. I walked away from each week's class with a more comprehensive understanding of the way different students viewed issues related to sports on campus, largely due to their background and tendencies of their particular sport. While the final project was a lot of work, I walked away feeling like I was able to explore a topic I was truly passionate about and had applied the material discussed in class.</comment>One of the most interesting class I have taken at harvard</comment></course>ENGLISH 168d: Postwar American and British Fiction</title>If you are an English concentrator or a student who just wants to learn more about the subject, it is a great option</comment>This is a wonderful course!! Although it doesn't quite feel like a course. It feels more like a wonderful book club with James Wood where we just read books that he likes. It is also very low time commitment. It is not necessary to read every text every week and Wood does not even really expect you too. However, you are missing out if you don't read them since they are all fantastic books. My section was also a lot of fun actually because it was made up of people who loved talking about books and were very invested in the material. This is a good class to take as a laid back elective.</comment>Wonderful reading list, very doable. I took a lot from this course in terms of how to read critically.</comment>Do the reading.</comment>Very relaxed class. James will teach you how to respect authors and style.</comment>It is excellent, relaxing, engaging, educative, and stimulating for aspiring writers. It's a treat to be in Professor Wood's class.</comment>James Wood is AMAZING! Absolutely take this class. You will walk away from every lecture with a new way to look at the world.</comment>This class is so fun and so chill. The reading is not only manageable but pleasant - 1 novel a week. You can write whatever you want on your essays, which are the only assignments besides reading for section. Professor Wood's almost conversational lectures will make you a better reader, because he teaches you to actually appreciate what you're reading.</comment>This class is an excellent review of books James Wood likes. The professor is intelligent and laid-back; the class is kind of just like his own personal book club. Work-load is very light, all the books a pretty short and you only have to write two papers. The class is fun and easy, but not exactly an exciting challenge. Still, if you're interested in reading some cool books for credit, it's a safe bet.</comment>Professor Wood is an incredible teacher. The reading list consists of excellent books - this class is effectively book club - that you may have heard of but likely wouldn't have read on your own. Furthermore, the assignments are entirely open-ended, so you can write about whatever book and subject you like.</comment>Absolutely take this course. Professor Wood is a superb professor who understands not only the craft of fiction but also the psychology of his student. Each book is delightful and brief, making this course incredibly manageable. As Professor Wood jokes at the beginning of the semester, this class is rather more like a book club than a traditional English course. The focus is always on the pleasure of reading and reading better. Lectures often consist of dramatic readings of pleasant passages, with a few brilliant remarks on the themes and diction. This is a marvelous, enjoyable course. I cannot recommend this course enough. If you like literature at all, you must take a course with Professor Wood. He is a true gem.</comment>Great course.  It's like a book club where you write two papers.</comment>James Wood is da bomb. He loves the books he's teaching, and is friendly, welcoming and engaging. His lectures are mind-blowing, and the tfs care about the class a ton. The reading is very manageable too - the longest book is like 200 pages.</comment>James Wood is a fantastic lecturer, and the books we read are very good. Wood's focus is definitely on enjoying the works rather than plowing through them and finishing them, which is evident from the time he takes to read out wonderful passages and quotes in class. He wants his students to appreciate the language and style that these authors had which made them so unique. I feel like this course made me a better reader and appreciator of language. I loved it.</comment>Relaxed, great English class. It's not going to be life-changing, but it is going to be solid and enjoyable throughout the whole semester. Professor wood gives fun and interesting lectures and leads relaxed discussion of the books (which are great) and section is more of the same. The only requirements are a midterm and final essay, for which you are free to do as you please.</comment>This course was great because, as James Wood himself said, if you really weren't interested in a book, you could potentially skip it, and hopefully concentrate that much more on the ones you did like. Postwar gives you the chance for some breathing room in your work, and moreover, the books are all varied and of good enough quality that you'll want to read them regardless. James Wood makes his lectures a comfortable, almost conversational atmosphere brimming with his fascinating thoughts and opinions.</comment>It's very little work and you really don't even need to read the books you aren't going to write about; however, the two assignments are just general "argument papers" and it's incredibly difficult to formulate theses.</comment>This course should be renamed "Book Club with James Wood." Although the reading list is wonderful and Professor Wood always makes insightful and interesting analysis, I didn't feel very invested in the course. There were too few assignments and too little structure.</comment>This course is a lot of fun if you take the time to read the books. Professor Wood is enthusiastic about the material and likes to get feedback from his students. It's easy to avoid doing the reading but you really won't get anything from the class if you do this. Lecture is structured loosely but Professor Wood has a lot of interesting things to say about the books and I definitely am able to look at books differently now than I did before.</comment>It's literally a book club.</comment>James Wood is always a delight. Take whatever class he's teaching.</comment>Take this class. It has a fantastic syllabus and a manageable assignment load (so you can actually read the syllabus). Lectures are interesting, but can be a bit disjointed. Trisha is a great TF.</comment>This class is incredible!  If you love reading and love listening to an editor of the New Yorker who knows EVERYTHING that could possibly be known about tremendously great books TAKE THIS CLASS.  One of my favorite classes at Harvard.  Do the reading, participate in section and class, and this will be one of the best experiences at Harvard.  I highly recommend this class to students who want to be writers or students who just enjoy reading good books and feel like they don't have enough time outside of class.</comment>this class is a gem. only two major assignments the whole year, and you have the option to rewrite the midterm paper. Felt like a good way to balance out a busy schedule filled with physics/orgo, and sometimes I forgot I was even enrolled in the class.</comment>james wood is godly. seriously, take this course and your appreciation for delightful prose and attentiveness to reading will grow tremendously</comment>This course is what you make of it.  It is possible to go through the course doing very little work, or if you wanted to you could get a ton out of Prof. Woods' instruction and syllabus.  If you have a hard courseload, you may find this class taking a back seat to others in your schedule.</comment>Lectures can be frustrating because they often are unrelated to one another and do not allow you to discuss and analyze the book in as much detail as one would like. Sections are better for this. The reading list is pretty great--there a some gems of novels that await you!</comment>This class is fabulous! A great way to read and learn about important books along with one of the most brilliant literary critics of our time. It's essentially a book club with James Wood.</comment>This is a course that allows a lot of freedom in approaching recent texts. If it feels a little like book club with James Wood, that's because it is, and it's wonderful.</comment>Perhaps one of the best English classes I have taken. Lectures are incredible and they really teach on how fiction works in literature and what rhetorical conventions contribute to its function. Also shows the vast range of writing styles. Class focuses on the complex nature of Realism.</comment>This is a pretty good course, it's just half of what it could be. A lot of the lectures have no trajectory whatsoever, and most consist of close reading passages. Wood is clearly brilliant, and so his interpretations can be very interesting, but it can also feel frustrating to never get a bigger picture look at what we're studying. The title, Postwar American and British Fiction, is a decent description of the syllabus, but in reality the focus of the class is on close reading and considering literature in a more metafictional way. It definitely helps you think about literature differently, but more focus and a feeling of some sort of trajectory or cohesion would greatly improve this course.</comment>Read all of the novels, and work hard on the papers because there are only two. Besides that, just enjoy.</comment>This is a great course. Relaxed, but you still have to do your work. The assignments consist of two essays, one 5-6 pages and one 7-8 pages. You might not be in love with all of the books at first, but Professor Wood will help you understand at least what is striking about each novel. Professor Wood is very personable.</comment>Take it!</comment>Students often call this class "James Wood's Book Club," a comment which sometimes has a derisive tone.  However, I found this class, and Professor Wood himself, entirely magical.  The class is very relaxed, but Professor Wood and the teaching staff are passionately engaged with the material, which makes for an incredible learning environment.</comment></course>MOD-HEB 130a: Advanced Modern Hebrew I</title>I would definitely recommend this class. It's fun, not too challenging, and you learn a lot. It's easy not to put your most into it, though, and that will leave you learning less than you would like, since it's very much a class in which you get out what you put in.</comment>Great class, one of the best I've taken at Harvard. Osnat is really nice and extremely helpful. She's always happy to help with questions outside of class, and also very flexible with due dates and etc. I learned a lot and my Hebrew really improved as well.</comment>The Hebrew Department at Harvard is unparalleled. The small nature of the department allows for so much individual attention, so that the teachers become mentors and you develop real relationships with your classmates as well. My hebrew drastically improved over the semester, and 130a is definitely a substantial step up from 120. Yet, I could not be more happy that I took the class.</comment>Tours of Israel, Israeli songs and literature, and minimal grammar. The course material was enjoyable. The final project was not hard, but quite tedious.</comment>Osnat is a wonderful teacher. She is patient and focuses on helping you to improve from wherever you're at. (So you don't need to worry if you feel behind the other students at the beginning of the semester.)</comment>It is fun and not too stressful. There are long writing assignments but not too many and the actual content isn't too difficult.</comment></course>SPANSH 61n: Advanced Spanish Language and Culture: The Ethics of Business</title>I would tell students that there are a lot of assignments, and they're not always easy, but ultimately it's a rewarding course.</comment>I think this class really gave me true knowledge about Latin American business practices in terms of outside and inside corruption. It taught me about real-world events that other spanish classes haven't really taught me. I really enjoyed this class, it was my favorite spanish class here, and I highly recommend it.</comment>Before taking the course and arriving at Harvard, I wasn't sure I'd be an RLL concentrator, but now I know it is what I want to do!</comment>This course is great! You'll learn about business through the lens of journalists' reports, literature by acclaimed authors, and movies. The presentations, especially the one on the business you choose, help you to practice public Spanish speaking as well as look into a business that interests you. Spanish language practice, learning about businesses and their potential dark sides, and expanding your knowledge of Spanish written works and movies- what more could you ask for?</comment>I loved this class! The only minor criticism would be to use literary sources less, and to instead focus on contemporary issues through policy, politics, etc.</comment>There's a wide variety of readings—be prepared to spend a lot of time on then. It's fun, overall.</comment>The professor is very intelligent and very flexible with deadlines if you need it. Plus you'll learn a lot.</comment>This class is great - Profesora is really sweet and a great teacher, and the course matter itself is really interesting. My Spanish definitely improved because class time is almost entirely discussion.</comment>This class covers a lot of really interesting topics and isn't too much work. However, the literature is often difficult and most of the section forgoes reading it, leading to awkward classes. Profesora is lovely, but she makes it clear if she likes you or not, and sometimes that can be offputting.</comment></course>EXPOS 10.003: Introduction to Expository Writing</title>This is class is very helpful. Make sure you use all the recourses available.</comment>KAREN IS AWESOME. She's really accessible and so happy to help. She had a positive attitude and really engaged the class.</comment>I would say that the preceptor was very dedicated to her students, and the course prepares students for Expos 20.</comment>It's a class that you will never regret taking!</comment>It really helps students with or without prior writing skills. It gives the basics to writing, which are actually the most important skills one needs.</comment></course>CLASSIC 98: Tutorial - Junior Year</title>This is a great class! I knew nothing about Greek or Roman law going into this class, but that has certainly changed now. Just make sure to always have a presentation prepared and do the readings to make this class a good experience for yourself.</comment>This course was somewhat pointless. We learned a fair amount about ancient law, but as a course that is meant to help us prepare and think about our thesis, I didn't get much out of it.</comment>These classes vary greatly each year depending on the TFs in charge. That said, Roman and Greek law is a very interesting subject with a lot of interesting themes, so by all means take it if that's where your interests lie!</comment></course>HISTSCI 206r: "It's Only a Hypothesis"</title>If you ever see a class on offer from Professor Schiefsky and Professor Mazur of this kind, seize the opportunity at once. Classes couldn't get much better than this.</comment></course>PSY 2160r: Laboratory for Affective and Developmental Neuroscience</title>Joining the Somerville lab has been by far one of my best experiences at Harvard. Professor Somerville and all lab members are extremely supportive and always willing to help out and share their knowledge and experience. They're a very young, lively group of people with a passion for developmental cognitive neuroscience - there's so much to learn from them!</comment>Everyone in the AN&D lab is amazing- sweet, dedicated, and welcoming. Also, Leah is phenomenal, and the work that she carries out throughout the semester is very interesting</comment></course>ECON 980u: Immigration Economics</title>Awesome if you like microeconomics and immigration</comment>This had been my favorite class at Harvard. You learn from an amazing professor that is very knowledgeable about the subject. If you are interested in labor economics or immigration economics, I would really recommend this class</comment>This class is a great opportunity to learn about and discuss a topic with an academic who is right at the top of his field. Take it! Some of what you'll learn is intellectually depressing: it's very hard to come up with robust answers to knotty empirical questions, and sensible people can come to very different conclusions. With controversial topics like immigration, this effect is magnified. But overall a very fun course. Borjas is cool!</comment>Prof. Borjas is an expert in this field. If you have ever been curious about why people move, who moves, and the impact of movers then take this class! Prof Borjas cares about the students and is very available outside of class. Take his seminar!</comment>Professor Borjas is an incredibly caring professor, get to know him and you will gain so much more from the course! He is truly the expert on this... I mean, he's written the textbook...</comment></course>PSY 3340: Research Seminar in Cognition, Brain, and Behavior</title>This is an interesting way to learn about the field. Lunch is provided.</comment></course>YORUBA B: Intermediate Yoruba</title>Very enjoyable classroom setting and usually small class so close personal interaction with the professor really helps when trying to learn the language.</comment></course>ANTHRO 1130: Archaeology of Harvard Yard</title>Very unique opportunity to do archeology as an undergraduate. Would highly recommend it to anyone remotely interested in Archeology.</comment>this class is amazing. even when it is cold and rainy everyone is just so EXCITED to be digging and discovering history first hand</comment>This course is fantastic. I mean, what other course lets you dig up Harvard yard? I learned a lot about the practical aspects of archaeology, as well as the history of Harvard. The professors are extremely knowledgeable but also very accessible and kind. Easily one of the best courses I have taken here.</comment>This class was one of my favorites at Harvard. There are very few opportunities to be involved in an archaeological dig if you're not an archaeologist - this class was so fun but I also learned a lot about Harvard's past and public archaeology.</comment>This class was one of the most enjoyable experiences of my first semester, and something I brag to friends both at Harvard and from home about. It is truly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to participate in a real archaeological dig. I had the chance to hold a pipe in my hands that hadn't been held since 1680. If that means something to you, TAKE THIS COURSE. You will not regret it.</comment>The class is as much work as you put into it but putting in more hours will yield to a much better and more interactive outdoors dig. Very hands-on and the learning curve for archeology is pretty steep.</comment>Take it! This is one of the best classes I have taken at Harvard! It's so different from any other course, and reminds us how much we can learn outside of the classroom!</comment>The Archaeology of Harvard Yard was a once in a lifetime learning experience that truly enhanced my freshman year.</comment>You do actual archaeology in the field which is incredible. Everyone is really supportive so there's no need to worry if you have no digging experience. You can get away with not doing the readings and the assignments are really easy.</comment>This was an awesome class! The dig is fun -- even if its raining, less so if its freezing cold. In this class you put a lot of hard work in during class but the workload outside of class is minimal. Diana and Trish are awesome and it is a lot of fun being able to work with them.</comment>This will be one of the best classes you take at Harvard. You get a chance to excavate Harvard Yard and find things that were left behind over 300 years ago.</comment>SO much fun! You will look forward to this course every week. Recognize that you will dig rain or shine, but you will have an amazing time and actually discover real 17th/18th century artifacts.</comment></course>BE 160: Chemical Kinetics and Reactor Design</title>Prepare yourself for the most Odyssean experience of Harvard. There is no guidance along the way; not even divine intervention could help you. Often times, I wished a car would hit me on my way to class to diffuse the pain this course caused; facing scylla and charybdis would have been an easier task than surviving this course.</comment>Literally the best engineering course I've taken at Harvard.  Both Needleman and Mooney are great lecturers and AWESOME people in general.  The material itself is extremely enjoyable. Very applicable, and actually fun to go through. The textbook is almost as good as the lectures, which really set the bar high. The psets were the right level of challenging, which is uncommon for SEAS. Overall, do take this course if you have even the slightest interest in chemical engineering. BE160 was literally the highlight of my semester.</comment>There is little I can offer in terms of advice for this class, as this was the first time it was offered and I'm not sure what changes they will implement. This has the potential to be a good course, if more people (20+, as opposed to 5) enrolled and if it was taught with a real section component and office hours.</comment></course>ENG-SCI 29: Introduction to Computational Design</title>Although the course is for students without any pre-knowledge in coding, it defintely help to have some.</comment></course>FRSEMR 24p: Getting to Know Charles Darwin</title>This seminar is fantastic. I was very surprised to find that only 4 students were enrolled this semester. Although this class meets for 4 hours, which is rather long for a freshman seminar, this is only because we went on amazing field trips every week! We had great opportunities to visit places both within Harvard and off-campus. There is a fair amount of work, with readings and a 1 page reaction paper due every week, but this is comparable to most other seminars. Ned is a great professor, with so much enthusiasm clearly evident for this subject. I also found Jose to be a wonderful TF. I would absolutely recommend this seminar to anybody. All of the students in our seminar were primarily interested in the sciences, but I do not think this is necessary to enjoy the course. You will get to know a lot about Charles Darwin in an intimate way, not only relating to his theory of evolution, and you will not regret taking this seminar!</comment>This class s the best class I took this fall. After every class I was left with thoughts about Charles Darwin and Evolution... Ned and Jose are like the A team when it comes to class. They finish each other´s sentences and make this class enjoyable. We were offered tea and coffee, saw pigeons, did experiments, touched Darwin´original letters and had a little bus that would take us around...</comment>It's probably one of the coolest Freshman Seminar. There are several field trips, which is uncommon in college, and they're all really fun and informative. This class is not meant to directly teach you about Darwin's work, but to show you Darwin, the person, which will inevitably draw in his work. Professor Friedman is super nice and just a happy guy in general.</comment></course>ENG-SCI 53: Quantitative Physiology as a Basis for Bioengineering</title>This class is extremely difficult but required for the Biomedical Engineering concentration. Make sure to use your TFs as they will be the only way to get through this course.</comment>The class is poorly organized and appears to have been for years. It's a absolute shame that nobody has made an effort to structure this course effectively, and nobody seems to want to. Teaming up with peers and holding your breath tell it's over is the only way to get through.</comment>The only reason you should take this class is as a Biomed requirement. It is so incredibly unorganized, unnecessarily difficult, and poorly taught that otherwise it is nowhere close to worth it. If you do have to take it, it's going to be rough for the first month or so, but then it gets easier for a while. Don't stress too much about the grade because it is a train wreck for everyone.</comment>This class was incredibly interesting and I learned a great deal. It was also a lot of work when Maurice was teaching. We had both problem sets and labs every week, and the labs were often long, repetitive, and time consuming. The one advantage of this is that I got to know my lab partners very well. The problem sets could also be quite long and difficult. The class requires sharp problem solving skills and you really have to synthesize all of the information you have learned. I would be weary about taking this class with several other hard or time consuming classes, but I would definitely recommend it.</comment>I mean you have to take it so take it. But get ready for some frustration.</comment>Unless you're interested in concentrating in biomedical engineering (whether or A.B. or S.B.), I highly won't suggest taking this course. Yeah, the material is interesting. Yeah, there are some interesting labs. But the level of disorganization just takes away too much from the course. Prof. Smith makes things too hard and moves too quickly; Prof. Bhatia teaches things a bit too slowly (though she does try to make sure we get her material very well). There really isn't a balance. Problem sets range from 50 to 200 points (and also difficulty levels vary too), so the imbalance can be very taxing. If the course had a bit more organization and better support, it would be an awesome course to take. But at this point, it's too disorientating and you come out feeling that all the time you put into it was to waste.</comment>This is a difficult class and not very well organized. The material is interesting.</comment>Do this only if you are seriously considering bioengineering--otherwise a lot of work.</comment>I kind of hated this class.  In the beginning of the semester, I would spend hours working on impossible problems on the psets--those kinds of problem where you read them and wonder if you ever even learned how to do that, since you have no idea where to begin.  On the first midterm I felt the same way, and so did everyone else since we all failed it.  I almost switched from BME because of this class.  However, after the first half, it really eased up and I was able to enjoy the material without stressing out so much about a heavy workload.  And, believe it or not, the material is actually incredibly interesting when you're not super frustrated by the psets.  My advice to future students is just to wait it out, since it does get easier.</comment>This class, overall, is very difficult. It is a lot of MATlab at the beginning of the course, which can be intimidating. Be ready for Problem sets that will take a minimum of four hours a week to complete. Quizzes are difficult. The class definitely keeps you on your feet. With that said, the teaching staff and TFs really care and help as much as they can. Would definitely recommend, if you are interested in BME and can handle a heavy course load.</comment>This class will be one of the most difficult classes you take, but will likely be worth it. The benefits of this class are that it introduces you to the fascinating quantitative side of physiology, which no other discipline can teach. Unlike many other physiology classes, there is no emphasis on memorization. Instead, the class emphasizes understanding of how systems work, and how dysfunction arises, which makes the material very interesting and exciting to learn. 

However, the complete lack of organization makes this class a battle, so be prepared. To get the most out of the class, it's best to start your work early and find a good pset group. Dr. Smith's psets are extremely challenging, particularly the first few ones, but don't let that discourage you. As long as you attend most of the TFs' office hours, its possible to get through the psets. Find a group of people to work with, and check answers with them, as this will make things a lot easier. Dr. Smith holds office hours, which can be helpful, especially for difficult problem sets (like the visual system pset) so go to office hours. Don't worry if the workload in the first few weeks seems overwhelming, you learn to adapt to it, and when Dr. Bhatia starts teaching, the workload drastically decreases. Understanding MATLAB is important for the labs and psets throughout the semester, so make sure you understand the tutorials assigned at the start of the course. 

Exams in this class can be extremely demoralizing, particularly Dr. Smith's questions, because they can be very challenging. It's important to go into the course recognizing that you wont get high 80 or low 90% on exams, but understanding that a lower score does not mean that you don't understand the material. Don't be discouraged by a low score on the first midterm, because Dr. Bhatia puts questions on the second midterm to make it easier. 

Overall, this course was challenging but extremely interesting. Being in office hours for multiple hours a week, you'll definitely make friends, and the BME community is very close. Don't be scared off by the high amount of work in the beginning, as you will learn to cope with it. Good luck!</comment>If you are concentrating in Biomedical Engineering, you have to take this course, so... If you can, try to make sure that you have a strong background in CS, math, physics, chemistry, and biology before you take this class. It's difficult, but you'll learn so much from this class and you'll come out stronger and smarter! I've personally learned so much about myself from going through the experience of taking this class, and I've personally really enjoyed the material taught despite the challenges. Overall, I'm glad I took this class, even though it has been the most difficult class I've taken at Harvard.</comment>This course is very time consuming and slightly disorganized, and it can be difficult to manage problem sets on top of laboratory reports.  However, the class support is great, and you quickly learn to work collaboratively with your peers.  The material that you learn is extremely exciting and useful, and Dr. Smith and Dr. Bhatia are excellent lecturers.  You will enjoy the class, but be prepared to devote a lot of time to it!</comment>This course felt like a roller coaster ride. There were times when I was fully engaged in the material and felt comfortable with what we were doing in class and others where I couldn't tell you what we had done for the past three lectures. The fact that the course is split between two professors means that there is massive shift in the way the material is taught and tested when going from one to the other, but it doesn't necessarily have to be this way if the professors actually communicated with each other and with the class. The labs in this class were pretty interesting, but it often felt like they had only a little bit to do with the material in class.</comment>The class' material is very interesting, but if you're looking to just explore medicine, this definitely isn't the class to take. The Psets and labs are very difficult and can feel tedious and painful-- definitely make use of as many office hour sessions as you can. The general disorganization makes getting a grasp on already hard subject matter even more trying.</comment>This class is brutal. The MATLAB assignments will drive you crazy, the psets will occasionally drive you insane. A reasonable way to think of it s that you are taught the alphabet and expected to write a novel for homework. Your mind will be blown by the awesomeness of the content but be warned, if you don't enjoy anatomy/biology, stay away.</comment>I can not express in words how horrible this class was. The professors were clearly intelligent and seemed to care about the material, but neither of them cared about the class. This is easily the most disorganized classes at Harvard and you should only take it if you need to concentrate in Bioengineering and if you have 20+ hours a week to do homework.</comment>Not very well organized, but the material is very interesting! Go to the professors' office hours because they care a lot about you learning the material even if that sense does not come across in class.</comment>If you take this course, be prepared for a somewhat disorganized class and a lot of work. Overall, however, the content you learn in this class is really really interesting and definitely worth all the trouble that this class may bring.</comment>This class is a necessary evil as a biomedical engineering concentrator. Don't take it unless you're absolutely sure or pretty sure that BME is the concentration for you, but do not take the class with the idea that it's representative of the rest of the department or the rest of the experience as a BME concentrator. Be ready to hit the ground running the first few weeks, because the work is pretty front heavy in terms of psets and labs and learning how to make Matlab work. But on the bright side, everyone else who takes the class with you is also on the struggle bus, and your classmates become like a mini family</comment>Go to help sessions/office hours.</comment>This was the most rewarding and interesting class that I took this semester, but go into it with some things in mind. The first half of the course will take over your entire life. I was consistently staying up until 2/3am at office hours to finish problem sets, and I was not procrastinating at all. People would start the problem sets the day we got them, attend office hours every time, and still be working on them the night before. They're hard. Do not wait to go to office hours, and do not wait to find friends in the class to study with. Both Maurice's and Sujata's office hours and helpful, so make an effort to attend both. The class is definitely frontloaded, so if you can make it through the first midterm, you can definitely handle the second half of the course. The class is plagued with disorganization and bad communication, so be prepared to be frustrated and to reach out to Maurice and Sujata when they've left you in the dark. Despite all of the flaws, the material is great, and you will truly feel like you're learning useful stuff. Even though some of the problem sets absolutely sucked in terms of workload and difficulty, I always turned it in feeling proud of what I'd learned and what I knew how to do. You will learn REALLY cool stuff.</comment>Only take if required for your concentration. Very tough and demanding</comment>The material is interesting, but by the end I considered dropping BME. The teaching staff seems like they're trying, but the teaching itself is still lacking. Sujata focuses a lot on the content and Maurice focuses a lot on application, which is hard to get used to. Maurice mumbles a lot and Sujata is usually unavailable outside of class. The class in general.. really made me want to transfer to MIT.</comment>This course is very intensive - the lab and homework components are extremely laborious. On a positive note, the subject matter is extremely interesting and you will be rewarded for all your hard work during the semester.</comment>This course is hard, you will struggle, but if you stay with it you will be happy you did. The material is interesting and everyone becomes good friends with each other by the end of the year through the mutual struggle of doing psets and preparing for labs and tests. You learn so much, not just material but methods of studying and testing as well as new ways to think.</comment>Some parts of the class are really unstructured</comment>It can be a pretty frustrating class at times, and it will consume your life at the beginning of the summer.  Nevertheless, it is super interesting material.</comment>The class is very unorganized overall. Don't get discouraged by Maurice's psets and quiz. They're much harder than Sujata's and it is possible to do well in the course even it seems like it is too difficult.</comment>It is a great introduction to the world of physiology and systems using mathematical models.</comment></course>APCOMP 209: Data Science</title>Good to work on, important to learn</comment>This is a very "practical" class. After taking this class, you will learn how to actually work with data and do statistics and machine learning properly. After taking this class and working through the psets, I feel prepared to do any kind of data science job, so definitely take this class if you're interested in something like that. I also recommend people from other concentrations, like biology or social sciences, to check this class out because you will likely be working with data in your research, and this class can really teach you how to get it done. That being said, the class wasn't very organized this year. The lectures were insipid and not very interesting, and the professor was not very good at explaining things mathematically. He was hand-wavy at times. Additionally, the course suffered some lack of communication with the students and posted poorly worded problem sets, requiring lots of Piazza posts to clarify.   As for difficulty: The more experience you have with programming (especially Python) and statistics, the easier this class will be. The psets are bi-weekly and take around 6-8 hours to finish. I would definitely recommend going into this class with some experience because there is a lot of coding involved. Otherwise you will literally have to Google everything and the first few psets will be tough, but in the end you will get the hang of it and you will have learned a lot.   This class can inspire you to keep doing data analysis and find some very cool patterns if you extend its lessons to your own research. I would recommend, but be aware of poor execution by the teaching staff.</comment>Long homework's with some good lectures.</comment>to the extent that assignments are carefully written, this course will be fun and you'll learn some interesting stuff</comment>Lecture is boring but we learn a lot from homework.</comment>Much of the learning is done outside of lectures. Read the python analysis book, it will help you save time when attempting problem sets.</comment>It's a good high-level overview of data wrangling, visualization, and machine learning.  None of the topics are covered in great depth.</comment>Great class on the general data science process</comment>This was a pretty interesting course. Lectures were very relaxed and interesting while problem sets went significantly more in depth into coding and thus were quite different from what was covered in lecture--I quite liked this; others didn't. As long as you're willing to figure things out on your own, you don't need very much programming experience coming in (I had just taken CS50, and even that much wasn't necessary). By the end of the course, you will have a pretty good grasp of data wrangling in Python (and the pandas library in particular). You work through interesting examples like baseball or election statistics; problem sets this year did get a bit repetitive and unnecessarily long by the end of the semester, and there were a lot of complaints about this. The instructors are really great though and really care about the material. I'm really glad I took this course--it wasn't too much work, and I feel like I got a pretty solid introduction to data science. The final project was fun too.</comment>Take your time with the assignments. Getting used to work with data requires some muscle learning as well, but once you got it, you got it!</comment>The homework and project is likely what data scientists doing in their work.</comment>The subject of the course is incredible and there is a lot of important and interesting material to learn. That being said, the staff was highly disorganized this year, and homework assignments were full of errors.</comment>This class is a good introduction to machine learning and big data analysis. Be prepared to spend lots of time learning python, pandas, sklearn, and few other python modules if don't already know them. Don't expect to learn the theory behind machine learning. Having a good handle on basic statistics will go a long way.</comment>It is a pretty broad introduction to data science, and good conceptual overview of many different types of analysis (such as PCA, random forests, support vector machines, etc).</comment>This course covers broad topics, but it offers very little depth.</comment>This was only the second year the course had been taught and the first time it had been taught with this staff. The identity of this course is still being defined, and the experience will depend largely on who is teaching/organizing the course. The problem sets were more difficult than necessary simply because the instructions were unclear. In fact, the most efficient approach to doing the homework was to wait a few days until the early starters worked through the problem set and asked questions on Piazza to clarify the confusing parts; this is clearly unfair. Most of the value of this course comes from doing the homework. The lecture material seemed unorganized and was not taught well. All that being said, this course has a lot of potential, and I do feel comfortable working on data analysis in Python now.</comment>Self-guided learning and an ability to solve programming challenges independently serve students well in this course. That mirrors much of real-world data science practice but will not benefit students in need of more hands-on academic guidance.</comment>Data scientist required.</comment>This course is too superficial for you to come away with anything. I wouldn't recommend it at all.</comment></course>PSY 2461r: Laboratory for Clinical and Developmental Research</title>Dr. Nock is the best!</comment>A great and noble lab.</comment></course>THI 101a: Introductory Thai I</title>I cannot stress enough how fabulous a teacher Wipa is! Learning Thai as the Thai Studies Initiative is beginning has also added an interesting component.</comment>This is an excellent course! Wipa is a truly caring, talented instructor who makes learning Thai really fun. You learn a substantial amount of vocabulary and phrases and it's really satisfying to be able to read some Thai at the end of the semester!</comment>Wipa is an awesome teacher and Thai 101a was a lot of fun. It also felt unorganized at times, but you will enjoy it and get some understanding of a very cool language.</comment></course>FRSEMR 31u: The Varieties of Conservatism</title>Expansive but rewarding reading list that will definitely change the way you view conservatism as a mode of thought. Definitely among the more intensive seminars, and definitely for more than just conservatives.</comment>This is not a class for conservatives. This is a class for anyone broadly interested in politics or culture (not necessarily both). It combines reading a couple of novels with analyses of modern politics and seminal texts on (conservative) political theory, and it actively seeks connections between them so that you feel that all the readings are relevant. For me, this has been the course that has contained the most discussion and the most rigor in terms of having to phrase arguments coherently. Most importantly, Professor Osadetz is a lively, engaging Professor, who doesn't shy away from vibrant debates and is genuinely accessible to students.</comment>Take this even if you aren't conservative at all</comment>This is a great freshman seminar--interesting but laid back, fruitful but not much work. You read everything from serious intellectual works to novels. The reading is not too intensive, and interesting anyway. A great fourth class, Professor Osadetz is awesome. and facilitates the discussion well. He has no patience for b.s. Really a perfect freshman seminar.</comment>It's a phenomenal class that really stresses the idea that ideology is relative, and that opinions are significant, but ultimately an opinion is valued for its validity within the context of a certain system. The course teaches you that in discussing ideological values, new idea naturally surface that allow you to formulate your own opinions, and that discussing conservatism shouldn't be stigmatized, but rather celebrated. In such a liberal environment, understanding both liberalism and conservatism equally is generally under-appreciated, since conservatism is written off so easily as ridiculous. But in this course, it taught me that in order to fully understand one opinion, you need to comprehend its opposite.</comment>This seminar can be really hit or miss. For many students I talked to, the seminar was amazing and a really enjoyable class with engaging discussions and interesting readings. For some like me, the class felt at times a bit cutthroat and aggressive. This class is for people who are super comfortable with critical discussion and are willing to back up controversial opinions against other strong opinions.</comment>Subject matter is interesting, Professor is excited, but it really depends on the group of people who take it with you.</comment>TAKE THIS CLASS! Osadetz is an amazing professor whose passion for the subject matter leaks through every single session. He's incredibly energetic and knows exactly what to expect of us (given the Pass/Fail nature of the class), but doesn't let that detract from amazing discussions each week. My favorite class of the semester</comment>Professor Osadetz is a good professor and a great man. The class is sometimes too unstructured, but you learn a great deal about the different kinds of conservatism in the world and Osadetz is a wonderful guide.</comment></course>HISTSCI 320qc: Secrecy, Security, Surveillance</title>Excellent course if interested on these topics.</comment></course>EXPOS 20.066: Cross-Cultural Contact Zones</title>Disclaimer: You will not enjoy this class, but you'll become a better writer.  Professor Mukherjee is very strongly opinionated, demanding, even controlling and bossy. For most of class time you will be listening to her very sternly and slightly aggressively lecturing us on what the class is doing wrong, what it needs to do, etc. Most of your class will be intimidated by her, a few will be genuinely afraid of her. In your draft conferences (where you and the professor review your first draft of an essay), she will be a very harsh critic and you'll likely walk out of there believing that you are a terrible writer and, ugh you have so much work to do.  BUT, the bright side is that Professor Mukherjee is very smart, insightful and knows how to help you develop the right skills to improve your writing. Even though she tells you it in an intimidating manner, Dr. Mukherjee gives very, very good advice; you'll see your written arguments visibly improve.</comment>If you're looking for an easy Expos class, this definitely isn't for you. If you want an excellent, rigorous preparation for college writing, look no further than this class. It took a long time for me to warm up to Sri and her teaching style, but her clear expectations, detailed and insightful feedback on essays, and commitment to working with individual students through 1-on-1 conferences really helped me to make significant gains in my writing skills. The reading are also fascinating as well, giving you a variety of perspectives on such a critical yet often overlooked element of human society and the human experience. You may hate yourself for taking this at first, but you'll definitely leave with no regrets.</comment>A lot of my peers disliked the class, but to a certain extent I think that's inevitable with expos. I enjoyed the material. Sometimes the class was very very stressful but at the end of it, it was a rewarding class.</comment>If you have a choice don't take this class. This class hasn't taught me much – the schizophrenia of the class prevents me from learning the skills of college writing effectively. This course's expectations are overblown and is graded much too harshly. I've never feared turning in assignments and talking in class before, but this class has succeeded in doing just that. Assignments take too long considering that you can spend hours working your hardest and produce a great paper that probably will still not meet expectations and receive a low grade. Material is usually difficult to understand. The instructor also acts like she is superior to her students. She says she doesn’t like to interject in conversation, but does more often than she doesn’t. If you’re wrong in conversation or in writing, she lets you know it, and makes you feel inferior.</comment>A very difficult class with material that is uninteresting in the first two units.</comment>This course was definitely one of the most memorable experiences of my academic career, which can be interpreted either way.  While I did learn a lot about how to logically construct arguments and analyze texts, the course is very challenging.  I dreaded going to expos many days because Sri can be rude in class to her students.  She shows up late (she calls it Indian time) every class and spends the first 15 minutes talking about logistics, in which she repeats herself multiple times.  This makes it so we have no time for the real content of the daily task.  She also calls out individual students.  In the beginning of the course, I remember her saying something along the lines of "Expos is a competition, and you are most likely going to lose it.  You may be used to winning in high school, but that won't be the case for this class."  I don't think it's good for preceptors to frame the class as a competition with classmates when our ultimate goal is supposed to be to learn.  You will form close bonds with your expos classmates because of the mutual struggle.  She will make you question every single idea you think of.  In our final essay, we had to use 6 sources in a specific manner, and it ended up being nearly impossible to do correctly.  She poses these challenges to you as a student, but does not necessarily help you in attaining ultimate success in overcoming those challenges.  She teaches you some ways to improve your writing, but only right before the final essay is due.  She also does not respond to emails, and she even says this at the beginning of the course.  She claims to push for discussion between students rather than the preceptor, but she interrupts the conversation after nearly every comment to give her own insight.  She tends to talk a lot during the course rather than wanting to hear our voices.  She also puts unnecessary pressure on students for discussions and assignments.  I remember her saying multiple times something along the lines of "this is the most important discussion of this unit.  Many of my students will be on border line grades, and this is your last opportunity for good participation.  This one discussion could determine your letter grade in expos" when we had five minutes left in class to talk about a text.  Right before it is time to give the q-score for the class, she tries very hard to get a good q-score rating from each student.  In this course, you will constantly be on your toes and stressed.</comment>Do not take this class, if you want the easy "A," everyone says expos is. This is not it. She's a good writer, a good thinker, a good academician, but in the human department she fails. She tries to pit her students against each other to get an A. She puts pressure on her students to give her a positive score on the Q guide, implicitly and at times explicitly. The subject could be a lot more interesting than she made it, but I guess the class is about writing and, in that regard, she succeeds in helping us.</comment>You will learn a lot from this Expos, however, you will likely not enjoy the class. The preceptor has an antiquated teaching philosophy, pitting everyone against each other in competition for grades, and is very set in her ways. She took over two weeks to return each essay, inducing stress, as we had no idea how we could improve for our next assignments. It is little things (not accepting questions over email, sending us assignments and instructions often time the night before a paper was due or five minutes before class started) that add up to a less than ideal Expos experience. Yes, you will learn a lot, but I am sure there are better Expos classes in which you will learn equally as much and not have to suffer so much. My entire class (as well as the other section) had numerous complaints, and we bonded over this experience. Workload-wise, there is a fair amount of reading (not that much for a literature-based Expos)- first unit was three short stories, second unit was essentially two essays and a novel, third unit was six short stories. There were also several smaller assignments (workshopping, analyzing model essays, handouts on plagiarizing, intros and conclusions, etc.), which were very helpful. The shame of the class is that the material is fascinating, and you learn a lot, however, the instructor experience makes the entire thing not worth it.</comment>This is a very challenging expos course, where a lot is expected from you at a very high standard. But because of this you grow in your writing and the hard work pays off when you see the progress you have made.</comment>Pretty much everyone hates Expos, so odds are, you'll dislike it no matter what course you take. That said, comparing my Expos to my friends', this one is definitely on the harder side. Sri is a tough grader, and will make you work very hard to revise your drafts. She also tends to dominate class discussion, so you won't get a whole lot of conversation in about the works that you read. The workload when you aren't rewriting your whole essay (which you'll probably have to do), however, isn't that heavy, and the works you read are pretty interesting. Also, Sri's comments are incredibly helpful during conferences - she pretty much tells you exactly what you have to do to rewrite your paper, so while you have to redo the whole thing, at least it's clear what you have to do. Be prepared to be challenged and frustrated if you take this class, but you will definitely grow as a writer.</comment></course>GOV 2082: Marx</title>Lots of reading</comment>Throughout the course of this class you will learn the history and intellectual effect of a particular thinker (Marx in this case) on political thought. For that alone, Professor Tuck's thoroughness is appreciated. But the reading is hard, and the class is very competent. It's easy to feel inadequate in the class, but going through the canonical works is enough to make it worth it. Not a class for beginners.</comment></course>HIST-LIT 90bi: Whodunit: Detective Fiction in Victorian England</title>This was a great class, and if the topic interests you, absolutely take it! This was my favorite course at Harvard, and the syllabus is well-designed so that the work is informative and thought-provoking, but also enjoyable.</comment>Amazing subject to spend time on...who doesn't want to learn all about detectives?</comment>This class gives a very good overview of the genre of detective literature as a whole, setting it in its proper historical context. But remember that it's a history and literature course, meaning that there will be a good amount of history covered as part of it. It's not all reading detective literature itself. As long as you have an interest in both areas, or an interest in understanding literary topics in the settings in which they originate, you'll enjoy this class immensely. And you get to watch Sherlock, so what's not to love?</comment>This is a great class with a fun syllabus and a wonderful instructor; it also drew a very interesting group of students who contributed their own knowledge of the genre to discussions, which I appreciated. It's an interesting mix of genres and mediums. It was awesome to see how a genre that is often considered just an opportunity for cheap thrills is actually and important literary and cultural argument.</comment></course>ENG-SCI 139: Innovation in Science and Engineering: Conference Course</title>in its current form, this is the easiest class you will take. However, if you want to work a little harder to learn a little more in an elective, they are out there.</comment>If you want an introduction to entrepreneurship, especially within the sphere of biotechnology, this is the class to take. Great material and teaching staff that you can learn a lot from in and outside of the classroom.</comment>This is an incredibly relaxed class that is also very stimulating, which is a great combination. You won't waste time doing meaningless problem sets or reading boring texts... the assignments and midterm and final projects are all great experiences.</comment>This class is terribly organized but very minimal work. You are essentially expected to develop a business plan/pitch based on one of several technologies for your final project. There are infrequent weekly assignments and sign-up sheets used for attendance. It was not a stressful class, but I find that I did not come away from it with any tangible lessons learned about innovation. Would not recommend as a good class, but a pain-free one.</comment>This class has very interesting material and a low workload.</comment>Good startup class to better understand how innovation is thought about from an academic perspective</comment>Its a interesting business school style class with little work requirements... take this class</comment>Worst class I have ever taken at Harvard. No structure, arbitrary grading, I basically didn't get anything out of this course.</comment>This course is a great opportunity to learn about innovation and everything surrounding entrepreneurship: it offers a valuable glimpse of the conventions and practices in this particular ecosystem, and the final project will teach you a lot!</comment>This class is a gem. It is interesting, with great professors and an almost non-existent workload. There are negatives, however. The class is disorganized, and you will not get adequate feedback on anything. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the class. One of my favorites at Harvard.</comment>Doesn't have a heavy workload. Instructions for assignments are nonexistent. Class seems very disorganized because there are so many people teaching it. Learned something about entrepreneurship from Weitz and Boyce.</comment>Great, pain-free way to learn about entrepreneurship and venture capital!  Listen during lectures and try to incorporate those lessons into your midterm and final project.</comment>139 Changed a lot this year, but the final project was on Biotechnology. I would recommend this to any student who is wants to learn skills in the intersection of business and technology. You learn tangible skills that will be useful to you.</comment>you get to learn a bit about the process of innovation, you project will have to be biotech though be warned.</comment>Although this class was easy, I got very little from it. The class was too big to have any meaningful case discussions, and the lectures were quite boring. The final project was interesting and fun, but we got very little help or instruction with it. Also, the teaching staff did very little in terms of feedback. Essentially, it was the situation where everything goes into a black box and out pops your grade. Still, for anyone who is interested in business or starting a company, this is a good introduction to this field, especially since there are very few business related courses taught at the college.</comment>Its very helpful and interesting (and also easy) but also disorganized. Don't get frustrated by that, just roll with it, because its ultimately a satisfying course.</comment>The class was inconsistent. Some parts were excellent, others were dry lectures. The course staff did not handle the huge course size well my year. Look to see if they've made improvements since then.</comment>Not only does this class require relatively little work, but the work you actually have to do - developing a mock company and giving a full pitch on it in front of a VC panel - is really interesting and, depending on your career path, especially useful. Lectures are neat as well and some are pretty interactive, though be aware that they do take attendance (there's no section, though!). The only negative I'd say is that the class isn't well organized and clear guidelines for the assignments aren't really presented, which made the grading seem somewhat arbitrary and slightly harsher than one would expect. Still, this class is a perfect combination of useful, really cool, and not much work - I'd highly recommend.</comment>The lectures and projects are great if you want to learn how to take an idea from inception to reality, how to build a pitch to give venture capitalists, etc.  Course organization was lacking, assignment expectations were often unclear.  Overall, however, I liked the course.</comment>This class can be quite disorganized. Grading seems a bit arbitrary at times and classes are sometimes randomly cancelled (though that gives groups more time to work on their pitch). However, it's really nice to be able to apply what is learned in class to a project that's pitched in front of a panel of VCs at the end of the semester. I also enjoyed having multiple professors lecture, since they all come from various fields and have various expertise and insight. Also, you choose your own groups, so be sure to pick people you think you’ll work well with.</comment>Grading is very unpredictable</comment>Loosely structured innovation course with nice pitch at the end</comment>Grading is absolutely random and based off essentially two assignments. Don't take it as a GPA booster, only take it if you really are interested in learning about startups in the biotech space. Talk to John Boyce and go to lecture, every one is really cool.</comment>This is class is a painless and very easy course to those who are interested in entrepreneurship biotech.</comment>I'm not sure if it will increase your chances at success at being an entrepreneur but it was fun and made entrepreneurship seem more real as a a possiblity</comment>Chill class</comment>You get a good overview of innovation and entrepreneurship for a Harvard class. You learn about startups, venture funding, and hear from live experiences. The class is very disorganized, the assignments are vague, and your grade is ambiguous throughout the whole course. The course is very easy with zero work. So take it as an easy elective.</comment>It's a very easy course if you want an easy 4th class, take it.</comment>NA</comment>Amazing opportunity if you are into biotech and want to do a start-up. A bit lame sometimes. Ill-organized. Good grades for not too much effort.</comment>It teaches about how to do a pitch. Everything other than that could be learned from somewhere like wikipedia.</comment>This class was definitely the easiest course I have ever taken. It was honestly really fun and I learned quite a bit about innovation and entrepreneurship. Almost no weekly work and a very doable final presentation.</comment>Lots of fun and still learn a whole lot!</comment>Better organization would help improve the course.</comment>The course is quite disorganized and covers a range of topics at the surface. Some of the findings in innovation and quite straightforward and there is nothing in this class that was mind-blowingly different from what I expected. Final project helps you learn a lot, especially as they bring in real VCs, but because it is a group of 8, groupwork is a complete disaster.</comment>Though the course sounded promising (real world experience pitching!  Working on tech the instructors actually wanted to spin out companies with!) it did not deliver.  It became instead an exercise in how to manufacture legitimacy by students who don't understand the technology.  I hope this is not what real biotech startups do :/</comment>If you end up in this course and it's larger than 20-30, it will be much more a lecture than a seminar/conference course. You will still learn a lot. If you ever want to use your technical knowledge in business or might consider a start-up, this course will provide a very good knowledge base and possible networking for future endeavors.</comment></course>ECON 2723: Asset Pricing I</title>If you are thinking about 2723 with Professor Campbell as an undergraduate, be advised that it is more difficult than 2010c and 2010d, the only other grad classes I have taken. Do not take for granted that having done well in 2010c and d or equivalent classes means 2723 will be easily manageable. If you can take the class and are interested in financial economics, definitely do. No other class I have taken at Harvard has gone through as much material as 2723 does and I have consequently learned very much. The class has been a unique intellectual experience and I would take it again with much enthusiasm despite the workload.</comment>You will get a great perspective on financial economics and familiarity with all of the main areas from a good teacher and researcher.</comment>It's hard. It covers a lot of material. It's time-consuming. Don't take the class as an elective - it's just too much time. But if you're interested in this stuff as a research field, it's great.</comment>This course does teach some nice theory, and practical problems in asset pricing, but for some reason, the conclusion most people get at the end of the class is that Asset Pricing is not a promising or enjoyable field to pursue - which is a valuable thing in itself. I think it's pretty clear to us that the representative agent models have exhausted their power in explaining real world phenomenon, so perhaps John can be more progressive and get rid of some parts of the course and focus more on the "frontier"</comment>This is definitely a hard course, but also very rewarding.</comment>If you are interested in asset pricing, it's probably the best course. But if you just want to have a general feeling for the field of finance it's probably a terrible course. I found it extremely technical and a bit narrow.</comment>To really understand the material is a lot of work.</comment>The course requires hard work, but is certainly worth taking given how much understanding you can come away with if you put in the required work.</comment>If you plan to do finance as a researcher and are good at finance, then it's a must-take, and in fact you might be able to get a lot out of it because so much is covered. But it's not a class to take on a whim.</comment>Poorly taught course. Uninspiring material with no intuition. Drop the course after the first couple weeks if you don't find the material interesting because it won't get any better.</comment></course>SCAND 90r.c: Norwegian</title>Norwegian is fun but difficult to pronounce!</comment></course>MCB 292: Cellular Biology, Neurobiology and Developmental Biology</title>This class is a lot of work when you have to present, but it's very engaging and you learn so much. The discussions we had in class were also very good.</comment>best course you can do</comment>Take it, totally worth it. You'll become a much better presenter in the end.</comment>Best class I've taken this term</comment>Great prep course for submitting the NSF</comment></course>EXPOS 20.242: Paradox in Public Health</title>It was very helpful in improving my writing. I found that my whole mindset around expository writing was shifted in a way that made it much easier to write effectively and quickly. Jerusha really cared about helping us and she made herself available if you wanted to seek extra help. The readings were much better than any of my friends' expos classes'. We mainly did shorter case studies while some other expos courses require you to read full books. Jerusha also made the homework relevant and we did not have very much. We only had one short response paper in the first unit and all the other homework was work to start our big papers.</comment>I loved this class! I really recommend it to anyone interested in public health/ medicine or someone who is just looking for an interesting expos class</comment>You get out of this class what you put in - if you participate in class and work hard on your drafts, you'll have a more constructive experience.</comment>This Expos class was absolutely incredible. It is easily one of those classes I give my highest recommendation to. Especially for anyone interested in public health, this course guides you through some very fascinating and controversial case studies and then equips you with the skills to identify and research a paradox in public health of your own. Jerusha is a phenomenal preceptor as well, and it is clear that she cares deeply about all her students. She is very well-versed in the field and an excellent resource if you ever any questions.</comment>I would tell students that if they have any interest in public health policy that they should strongly consider taking this course to further explore their interest.</comment>This course is pretty solid for an expository writing course. I was able to connect with the preceptor and write about public policy, which was enough for me.</comment>Expos is a great way to become a better writer. At times it may seem like the class requires many unnecessary assignments and has a lot of busywork, but it's a Harvard requirement so you have to get it over with.</comment></course>PHIL 3: Introduction to the Problems of Philosophy</title>This was my favorite course I have yet to take at Harvard! It was a great survey class on Philosophy. You don't need any background knowledge to take this course, and because this course covers many topics in philosophy, it is a good introductory course to take to see if you want to pursue philosophy further. Also, Bernhard gives such great lectures. He gives you handouts each lecture and posts the powerpoints online so that when it comes time to study for the weekly quizzes, you have many materials at your disposal. The reading is also very doable each week, and because Bernhard gives such comprehensive lectures, it's okay to fall behind in the reading (even with weekly quizzes).</comment>Meh.</comment>Do not take this course if you are not wiling to delve quite deeply into philosophical issues and spend some time scratching your head trying to figure out exactly what these men (and 1 woman) were saying. Take this class only out of interest an curiosity, not for an easy A.</comment>Prof. Nickel is a fantastic lecturer and person in general, and the TFs are great. You'll learn a lot and definitely get a real appreciation for philosophical problems. The staff is very open and accessible and are willing to humor all sorts of questions. Readings seem mandatory but because the lectures do so well covering them, they're almost optional.</comment>A very good course to explore the main areas of philosophy. It provides a general yet useful introduction to the major problems of philosophy while equipping the student with a "philosophical toolkit" to pursue philosophy later with greater success and fluency.</comment>It gets you thinking about life in a different way.</comment>If you want to be challenged to think about the world from new perspectives and debate what it even means "to think about the world" this class is for you!</comment>This course is a great overview if you may be interested in philosophy or just want to know what it's about.  It discusses major philosophical ideas as well as logic and philosophical writing.  It is important to come into the class with an open mind and the motivation to think about things until you figure them out.  You need not know about specific philosophers.</comment>If you are genuinely interested in philosophy but unsure which part of philosophy interests you most, this course could be good for you.</comment>This is an awesome course. Professor Nickel is one of those archetypal teachers who might just change your life (think Dead Poets Society, etc.) Be aware that this course is a broad survey course, which limits how deep the analysis of arguments and texts can go. Additionally, many of the texts and thinkers covered will be pretty familiar to those with previous experience in philosophy. However, this course excels in showing you how it all fits together, and is worth taking even if you've already taken an intro philosophy course elsewhere.</comment>Philosophy 3 is a very rewarding course whether you are interested in philosophy or not for the following reasons: 
(1) Professor Bernhard Nickel is an awesome guy, and an awesome teacher. You will definitely enjoy his quasi stand-up lectures, though you might find that he has a bizarre sense of humor due to his German background at times.
(2) You will read awesome texts. From Plato to Descartes to Kant you will read a lot of the philosophical classics and contemporary thinkers. The texts are thought-provoking and you will start to view your life, your believes, and your habits differently as you get used to the practice of rational scrutiny.
(3) You will learn to argue rigorously and to write concise and effective prose. Prof. Nickel is a master of language so make us of his knowledge.</comment>This class was excellent, I wish I could have taken advantage of the class more. Always do all the readings. It can be hard, as there are a lot of them, but you get so much more out of the class.</comment>This course gives you a strong foundation for different types of philosophy, and helped me figure out which branches i liked and disliked. That said, I think the section could be improved by more rigorous discussion.</comment>Bernhard Nickel is my hero.</comment>Read the material and you'll be fine.</comment>This class will help you to think, reason, and understand people's ideas in ways you have never done before. The issues and problems that you will consider will make you think harder about why it is we live our lives the way we do. Through the readings and Professor Nickel's lectures, which are intriguing, engaging, and enjoyable, you'll really come to know how little and how much we know. I thoroughly enjoyed this course, and I highly encourage anyone to take it. The perspective that this course provides is invaluable.</comment></course>ENGLISH 158a: A History of Western Drama</title>This class was amazing. Professor Miller is by far the most captivating and engaging teacher I have ever had. He makes you look at performance in an entirely new light. If you enjoy reading plays, this class will be very interesting. Do not need to be interested in studying performance or theater to take this class, still incredibly interesting.</comment>This course is fantastic! Professor Miller is an awesome lecturer, and the plays we read were all very representative of the different periods of drama. This class is definitely manageable for non-English concentrators, and it was one of my favorite classes this semester!</comment>The class moves really fast and is graded out of 100! Don't blow off assignments or readings - the class is (surprisingly?) cumulative and the more engaged you are, the more you'll get out of the class and the "easier" it'll be. The assignments don't aim to trick you, but make sure you're doing what you ought to be for the class. That said, large assignments and heavy readings tend to fall on the same day, so plan ahead. Don't take this class if you're looking to coast!</comment>The class is good, yet it will not change your life. Derek is super engaging and energetic. The material is fun, but you never need to operate beyond a high-school level.</comment>The course requires a lot of reading and so far is full of readings that highlight white male playwrights. The professor is very engaging, humorous, intelligent, and open-minded, however. If you are having trouble he is understanding and is accommodating.</comment>I'm really glad I took this class because as I consider theater important to me I also consider it to be important that I have a strong grasp on the arc of the canon. I think since theater has been such a significant part of culture in society it is also relevant for people who aren't already interested in theater.</comment>Learn to write for your TF early on</comment>A good English course for students with little background in the subject.</comment>Professor Miller is a professor that has not lost his high energy and love for the subject matter he teaches like some professors I have had. His enthusiasm is infectious, and you will feel like you should start a career on Broadway after every enthralling lecture! This is a painless English Elective for Pre-Med Students, and the course load is next to nothing!</comment>Be prepared to read a lot, but you are likely to enjoy a lot of the works.</comment>There is a lot of work, and most students are english majors.  If you are taking it as a gen ed then be prepared to be underprepared.</comment>It was a fantastic course! Loved the plays and the lectures and it was a reasonable amount of work! Highly recommend!</comment>Very interesting, and gets you to think about performance in a larger-world context. A fun class, with a good selection of dramatic works. Lectures are super-informative and were bright spots of my week. Loved this class, one of my favorites here.</comment>Professor Miller is great. He truly cares about the students and is always willing to help or clarify assignments. The assignments are relatively spread out over the semester, so most of the homework is dedicated to reading the plays.</comment>This class is a great course to take if you have any interest at all in theater either as a reader or as a performer. It is a fair amount of reading, but it is all really interesting, so worth it! Professor Miller is also a really compelling lecturer and really cares about the material but is also super approachable.</comment>It requires a lot of reading, but it's TOTALLY worth it.</comment>If you enjoy theater this is a great class about theater. Professor Miller has a lot of really interesting thoughts on theater and knows a lot about it.</comment>Derek Miller is a passionate and knowledgable professor who has constructed an excellent syllabus.  If you don't want to dive into theatre, then do not take this class.  But if theatre is something that at all interests you, then you NEED to take this class!</comment>good</comment>This class is exciting, fun, and will allow you to read more plays in a semester than most of us have read in our life time. Take this class and come and talk to the rest of us about it.</comment>It is fast paced with a LOT of reading, but it is a great venture into what drama is, and you will come out a much better informed student.</comment>Prof. Miller is a great professor who really cares about the subject and is always organized in class. The class itself is a really fun way to read a bunch of plays, which I personally enjoy more than, say, poetry or old english writings. I recommend this class, even as a gen ed; it's not too much work but you'll learn some interesting things.</comment>Professor Miller is a fantastic lecturer and this class will expose you to a wonderful array of plays from the western dramatic canon.</comment>If you love theatre, this is a great course for you to expand your understanding and appreciation of art.  It gives you an expansive understand of theatre from a historical and artistic standpoint.  The assignments are repetitive and a little tedious but the plays are all amazing.</comment>This is a fantastic class! Definitely take it if you're interested at all in reading plays.  Professor Miller gives fantastic lectures and it's a great chance to read a ton of classic plays.</comment></course>FRSEMR 40n: The Twenty Years' Crisis, 1919-1939: Democracy, Totalitarianism, and Everything Between</title>This class is perfect for those who love the interwar period, the politics and philosophy that hovered over that period. Ian is an excellent professor, if he sees that your interests are not sufficiently discussed in class, he will definitely find ways to encourage those interests still. Taking this freshman seminar is the best decision of the whole semester.</comment>The class entails no real pressure or stress, but if you are interested in the material, it is definitely worth your time to do all the work and readings in order to really get something out of the class.</comment>My initial response after the first day of the course was very negative. In fact the first couple of weeks made me think that I didn't like history anymore. Then I started noticing things. The texts started coming alive. I started drawing connections and seeing the past from the perspective of those who lived it. This is coming from someone who considers himself relatively practical. This class truly introduced me to political philosophy and taught me how to study history. I would definitely recommend this course.</comment>I enjoyed this class a lot and really appreciated all that I had learned about changing perspective. Still, you have to be willing to put in the time. Ian can assign up to 300 pages or 200 pages in one week. Equally, some people spent only an hour or so on parts on the reading, and felt ok to come to class and not participate that much. Ian is incredible and even though there are response papers every week, he is not very discriminating with what you hand in as long as it seems like your also enthusiastic about the material.</comment>I would recommend this class overall--the instructor asked very interesting questions in discussions, which were always engaging, and the assignments were open-ended explorations of whatever themes students found interesting in the text. I would recommend the class particularly to students interested in political theory, which was the focus of most of the readings.</comment>This class is an excellent setting to work on critical reading and writing skills while developing a firm grounding in the political and philosophical thought of the early decades of the 20th century. Professor Storey also has a remarkable knowledge of the history, philosophy, and in general, the nuances of this period in time and many other periods. His knowledge is incredible--no question goes unanswered. To learn from Professor Storey is a great experience.</comment>Readings can sometimes be a bit dry, but for the most part they are really good and this class is a great way to get your feet wet discovering the joys of philosophy, political theory, and history. Professor Storey is awesome and really insightful. I grew to really love the class and the weekly discussions we had were incredible. As a heads up there are weekly readings and a 1-2 page response papers.</comment>It is a good class, but it has a lot of reading for a pass/fail class.</comment>Ian is a very interesting person and someone you will just enjoy listening to because he knows a lot about a lot of things. His class is really nice and discussion is not intimidating. The readings are interesting and the final class makes the whole semester worth it!!! Put in the work for the readings (more than most seminars) and you'll learn a ton about history, politics and where we're headed. The final paper is a blast to write because it is very open ended. Do take if you are at all interested in history, politics, the World Wars. Ian will not disappoint!</comment>This is an interesting class but it is A LOT  of work. There is about 100 - 250 pages of reading  and a 1-2 page response paper due every week. It's a great class in that the discussions are interesting but I did not think it was worth taking the class as a freshman seminar and having it be graded pass/fail. There are a lot of easy freshman seminars out there but this is definitely not one of them.</comment></course>ENG-SCI 21: The Innovator's Practice: Finding, building and leading good ideas with others</title>This is a great class that I think everyone should take if only to learn the human centered design process. The class is quite unstructured and so you'll need to be motivated as a team in order to produce excellent outputs. A lot of this experience will depend on the team cause you will spend all of your time with them. You can't choose a team, but know that you're grouped based on interest so take the survey seriously. Other than that, put in the time and effort, and you'll end up with something you can take to the iLab!</comment>waste of my elective and time. startup class takes ridiculous amounts of time. you do not get to choose your team.</comment>This course is one of the kind. It's a really unique opportunity and I would really recommend taking it. You get to work on an interesting project with people from different schools and learn a ton about working with other people. I wish Harvard had more opportunities to get immersed into a team project like that. The professor is a great resource and the material she's teaching is very relevant.</comment>Take it if you are good at designing or want to learn how to work with teams. If you hate grop projects don't take it</comment>Not all students like the class's lack of structure</comment>Amazingly instructed by Beth, a class which teaches you small-team innovation methods</comment>Exciting and different class that challenges you in other ways than most other classes at university.</comment>The course itself was a great opportunity to learn through experience the different practices and processes associated with innovation and the development of an original product. It's framed very well, in a way that introduces students to some of the psychology, sociology, and business principles connected to team work and innovation while they themselves conduct research, solve problems, and develop solutions in teams.</comment>If you're interested in entrepreneurship/intrapreneurship this course is for you. Rather than just learn about what it is it challenges you to tackle an existent problem and work through solving it from field-work to prototyping. You may very likely begin a startup out of this course as many of my peers plan on doing. I enjoyed this course very much and it seemed like all of my peers did too.</comment>Take this course if you want general exposure and a manageable workload class.</comment>Depending on your group, you might get pretty far along on a compnay/venture. However, if you do not click with your group, there is a lot to be learned from working and creating a synergetic team environment with many odds agains you.</comment></course>SOC-STD 98nd: Mass Violence, Memory, and Reconciliation</title>This class doesn't hold all of the answers to problems of mass violence, but it asks all the right questions. I appreciated how this class never shied away from the really hard mental work that goes with talking about mass violence, memory, or reconciliation. I'm not sure that I am coming away from this class feeling "settled," but I certainly feel inspired to engage with this subject matter even further.</comment>This is a great class for discussing memory of violence. If at all interested in how countries become nations following periods of mass violence, this course is a really good choice.</comment></course>CHNSLIT 242: From Fiction into History</title>Brilliant survey of post-1989 Chinese literature, truly wide-ranging. From masterpieces to science fiction to popular literature to political discourse, you get a really complete picture of what's going on.</comment></course>HIST-LIT 90az: The African American Great Migration</title>Make sure to commit adequate time to the blog posts.</comment>Being in a seminar with only 3 people was intense- it was very obvious when you hadn't done the reading. But it was a very unique experience to be able to work so closely with such a brilliant professor and to get a lot of personal attention and support on writing assignments. There is a lot of reading for this class and Erin is a fair but harsh grader so it is definitely difficult but worth it.</comment>Not only is the class incredibly interesting, but it is obvious that the professor really cares about both the material and the success of the students.</comment></course>FRSEMR 24n: Child Health in America</title>If you have any interest in health-related topics (i.e. global health, healthcare reform, etc), I highly recommend this seminar! The Palfreys are both incredibly interesting and wonderful individuals, and they do a fantastic job at fostering group discussions. They really allow the students to shape the class by encouraging the students to bring up topics that they find interesting. The workload is very manageable--it is a low stress environment. Overall, the class was definitely one of the best parts of my first semester at Harvard!</comment>Hands down, the greatest Freshman Seminar in the history of all Freshman Seminars. The Palfrey's and Sam are the kindest, most interesting people you will meet at Harvard. It doesn't matter if you're a pre-med, or if you're interested in government or economics, this class really takes a holistic viewpoint on children's health and healthcare in America. Every year, Dr. Palfrey invites everyone in the seminar to shadow him at Boston Medical Center over the course of the semester, which is an added bonus for anyone considering a career in the healthcare field. The life experiences that I took away from this class couldn't have been acquired in a traditional classroom setting. You have 7 more semesters to take that gov. class or that chem lab that you're trying to squeeze into your freshman fall... you won't have an opportunity like this again, so definitely take advantage of it while you can, I promise you won't regret it!</comment>The Palfreys are incredible people, personally and professionally. As leaders in their field, they draw from a wealth of knowledge and life experiences in teaching the class. They are passionate educators and mentors who welcome questions and foster independent thinking. The teaching fellow, Sam, is also a wonderful resource. He is always willing to meet individually outside of class to catch you up or to help you think through an assignment. Many alumni of the seminar return to Apthorp each year to hear the final student presentations, which speaks to how memorable and special of an opportunity the class is.</comment>The Drs Palfrey are so enthusiastic and really love teaching the class and it shows. Sam is equally as awesome</comment>This class was very fun! It taught me all aspects of medicine and made me interested in getting a minor in public health.</comment>Take this seminar!!! It is an incredible community of people and you will learn essential information about extremely important problems in medicine. Not just for science people!! Everyone would benefit, and the Palfreys are AMAZING! Take it just to meet them! And the material is critical to learn!</comment>The course itself is very broad and overarching but you definitely come out of it feeling confident enough to form your own opinions on certain policies on the healthcare system for children today. But most importantly, working with the Palfreys is incredibly valuable. Both of them have so much information to share and the work they have done in the health care system is inspirational.</comment>To quote Mean Girls: "The greatest people you will ever meet."</comment>the class was sometimes boring and I felt like we only got a quick overview of child health in america. In truth, it felt more like a freshmen orientation than a course, and in that sense it was a great experience because the Palfreys and Sam are great and more than willing to help you along. It was a nice environment to be in to make the transition from high school to college.</comment>This class is an amazing experience with an amazing small-class community. I highly recommend taking this class!</comment>Drs. Palfrey are wonderful people and the seminar, held in their own living room, intimate and calm. However, it lacked a lot of direction and it felt like I didn't really learn anything I didn't already know. However, it did make me more alert to child health issues in the world and news that I would say I wouldn't have been aware of previously. The final project, though pretty unguided, is challenging and interesting and a lot of cool ideas end up being presented.</comment>If you have any interest in medicine and have the opportunity to take this seminar, you should absolutely go for it! Child Health in America was my favorite course this semester, and I have a feeling that it will be one of the most memorable and fulfilling courses I have the opportunity to take in my four years at Harvard. 

Drs. Palfrey are experts in their field, and are doing incredible work -- both through their clinical practice in Boston hospitals but also through their advocacy and leadership in pediatric health policy throughout the nation. They take a holistic approach to teaching about child health, always encouraging students to examine the complex racial and socioeconomic disparities in health care access and outcomes as well as the question of why the United States ranks low on child health outcomes compared to other developed nations. 

From the class discussions to the reading to the written assignments, each aspect of this course is engaging. While the ten-page research paper seems daunting at first and requires a lot of hard work, Drs. Palfrey and Sam are there to help every step of the way. You'll definitely improve your writing (and public speaking ability) as a result of the seminar, which involves frequent papers and two presentations. 

One last perk: the seminar takes place in Drs. Palfreys' home at Adams House and delicious baked goods are served at each session.</comment></course>GOV 94td: Tough Transition: Consolidating Democracy under Adverse Circumstances</title>This is one of the most difficult classes in the government department, in my experience at least, but also the most instructive.</comment>This is a great seminar! It will really push and challenge you to defend your views on Western liberal democracy. Make sure you do ALL The readings and watch ALL the videos. George is a really engaging and supportive teacher.</comment>The course is incredibly rewarding. You get the chance to learn a lot about something that really matters in this world. However, do know that it is a lot of time and work. If you are willing to put in the hours, you may leave this class inspired by some topic of democratic consolidation that could inspire further research and devotion.</comment>George is a fantastic seminar leader; he provides great summaries of the readings and major ideas, but leaves plenty of time for discussion. The readings can be a lot, but are really interesting and definitely worth the time.</comment>This is a great class, and you'll get a lot out of it if you do the reading. It's one of those classes that makes you more well-rounded and capable of having political conversations.</comment>Take it only if you are interested in the subject matter.</comment></course>ENGLISH Clr: Dramatic Screenwriting I: Workshop</title>Take this class! Mark is awesome, and the workshop format allows for really solid feedback on your work.</comment>This class is a lot of fun. Mark is a great guy and you really do come away with a better understanding of the demands of screenwriting.</comment>Screenwriting with Mark Poirier is a fantastic course. As with all workshop courses, you determine the dynamic of your course. We had a great arrangement of unique voices. Mark facilitated discussion very well, and his comments were extremely helpful. Mark's knowledge of the industry and his care for his students really shines through as he leads class. If you get into this course: Absolutely go to office hours. Mark is extremely helpful one-on-one, especially as you develop your ideas. He also advises us based on all of his industry experience.</comment>GREAT!</comment>Take this course if you want anything to do with screenwriting or TV writing.</comment>There is no reason not to apply to this course! Whether you want to make it in the industry or you're just curious to learn about the elusive craft of screenwriting, everyone learns so much from analyzing each other's creative concoctions. Be sure to be able to ask questions and take criticism positively, as honest feedback is the only way that your writing can improve. The creative process can be frustrating, and some people start at different levels than others, but if you go to office hours, and seek other people's opinions, than there is no reason that you will improve your eye for good writing and good film via this course! Be sure to write a story your passionate about, even if it is super ambitious and crazy, because you want all the waning hours spent thinking about your protagonist to be worth it and voluntary!</comment>This course is fabulous and Mark is a great instructor!  I learned so much from the feedback and practice writing this course provided me, and I feel like I'm in a good place to continue my screenplay into its second and third acts and finish it on my own.  It gives you the tools you need to write screenplays of any genre in the future.</comment>Take it. Even if you don't plan to be a screenwriter or if you're not interested in film. This class will make you a better writer and overall better thinker.</comment></course>SOCIOL 97: Tutorial in Sociological Theory</title>If you're taking this class, it's because you have to. Some of the readings are kind of dense (like Marx), but you have plenty of time to go over everything in section, and the assignments are very straightforward.</comment>Don't worry about having to work with difficult material; everything is explained, and discussions will make things very clear. Your TF and the writing fellow are also very willing to discuss paper topics with you. As long as you put in the work for the course and make an effort to understand the readings, the other students and your TF will help you fill in the gaps in your knowledge.</comment>Very solid, manageable course that gives you a good theory foundation.</comment>This is a great class that will give you a better understanding of social theorists. Even if you cannot finish every reading, I would recommend trying to read most of them each week because the discussion are interesting and illuminating. I am more confident about concentrating in Sociology after this course.</comment>Please take this class if you think you are interested in Sociology. If you are unsure of concentrating in sociology, take the class. Ignore its status as a "requirement." Had I known the class would be this good I would have taken it as an elective regardless. Great readings, great papers, great TF's.</comment>This course is more rigorous than your average Sociology course, but I found this refreshing. The readings are interesting, and necessary for any Soc concentrator to read, and the teaching staff care deeply about it. You'll learn a lot.</comment>Your experience is partially dependent on your TF. I can't speak to the other TFs' abilities, but Nathan was great. Otherwise, the course is basically self-taught, as sections are mostly used to go over material you are expected to learn by yourself. If you're interested in sociology, it is a very rewarding class. The workload is also fair, and the content of the reading is valuable.</comment>Fantastic introductory knowledge to key philosophy/sociology.</comment>This course is a lot of work, but it is a grea the t class. Such a small class allows you to work through difficult theories. If you do all the reading, you will get a lot out of the class.</comment>This course is very challenging but it will help you deeply understand sociological theory.</comment>This is one of the best classes I've taken at Harvard! Although it's taught by TF's, TF's are actually more likely to be approachable in terms of explaining the material- they've learned it recently enough that they know how best to help you understand the concepts.</comment></course>FRSEMR 30q: Death and Immortality</title>Though the class was generally interesting and touched upon some very unique issues, the execution was not always great. The discussions in class were sometimes lackluster and didn't get the whole class involved. What could have been very interesting discussions because of the readings turned into long, drawn-out talks about just specific parts of the book.</comment>This course will be different from any other course you have taken in high school. It will test your ability to think abstractly, but if you focus on the paper and attend office hours, you will be able to write extensively on one topic.</comment>Get ready for one of the most interesting classes and discussions you've ever had about some of life's most grappling questions</comment>Pay attention in class! Talk more and get involved.</comment>It's a blast! It will make you change the way you think about your life, and especially about your death. It will be a lot of fun, and definitely use what you learn outside of the classroom. That is the best part about the things you can learn in this class, the stimulating conversations they can inspire among your friends.</comment>This is a very interested class. If you have a lot of questions about death, this class will help you greatly. You will end up with more questions than answers but that's the beauty of philosophy. Professor Chen is amazing and I really enjoyed this seminar.</comment>This is an excellent introduction to philosophy for those with a prior interest in the subject. It may feel dry for someone unsure of their interest in the discipline, but the readings are fascinating and cover a wide range of topics such as value, morality, suffering, etc.</comment>Make an effort to foster discussion during class and time might pass by quicker.</comment>Take this course with an open mind about the field of philosophy.  I knew nothing about philosophy before taking this course but now I am very interested in the field.</comment></course>ANTHRO 1988: Kinship, Citizenship, and Belonging: Seminar</title>Take the class, but it might be useful to be familiar with well-known anthropologists.</comment>This course will inform students about the formation of societies. Its a perfect introduction to Anthropology studies</comment>This class is a lot of work - be prepared for theoretical heavy-lifting and to either sink or swim every class. But throw yourself in -- the water is warm, and fascinating!!!</comment>This course is an excellent introduction to theories of kinship, which Professor Meiu also ties into citizenship very effectively. This course provides connections to a host of older literature, but then moves forward to consider the ways in which kinship is highly relevant to students interested in colonialism, nationalism, issues of citizenship, migration, and the state. It's also an excellent introduction into anthropology, since discussions range over methodology and the ethics of anthropology as well.</comment>Read the readings, write quickly in class, go in for questions at office hours.</comment>This is one of the best courses I've taken at Harvard. Professor Meiu is fantastic and fascinating (go to his office hours!) and leads the class energetically and skillfully. The content is great, and makes you re-think not only the way you understand kinship, but also all sorts of facets of human interaction and identity-formation. 

I think it might be a bit harder for a first-year or someone with no social sciences background at all to access the content and discussion, but that's not to say that this would be impossible, if that person was really interested in the material--Professor Meiu was careful to give background and context for everything that we read and it made the content much more accessible than it would be elsewhere.</comment>Interesting sections and a fascinating, intelligent professor.</comment>I have already recommended it to several people with a lot of enthusiasm!</comment>This course is a great way to expand your knowledge about kinship and improve your background in feminist, Marxist, and queer theory. The theory can be quite dense, so you should be prepared for a few difficult readings.  The professor does a good job explaining the material.</comment></course>RELIGION 46: The Letters of Paul: Ethnicity, Sex, Ethics, and the End of the World</title>This class was amazing! It's hard not to enjoy a course when a professor is obviously concerned with the academic well-being of her students. Professor Nasrallah is one of the most invested and genuine instructors that I have had the privilege to learn under. Everyone's thoughts are valued in this course. Oh, and the Apostle Paul is one of a kind. Loved learning about him through so many perspectives.</comment>Focus will lie heavily on modern, particularly postmodern, gender, race aware readings of Paul</comment>No matter what your faith background, this class has something to offer you. This course helps you think about how the letters of Paul, a central aspect of Christian tradition, have had an impact on YOU and the culture you live in. If an atheist like Nietzsche can write so elegantly and passionately about St. Paul, you know Paul is worth learning about.</comment>Professor Nasrallah is a great lecturer, the material is fascinating, the discussions are invigorating, the class is challenging- you read a variety of extremely interesting texts, you touch on politics, history, theology, sexuality, everything!</comment></course>DRAMA 137: The Art of Scenography: 20th and 21st Century Directorial Concepts and Set Design</title>It's a really great course! It will definitely make you a better designer.</comment>This is a phenomenal course! Julia is an amazing instructor. Definitely take this course.</comment>I cross-registered for this course and loved it. Every lecture was engaging. Julia is unbelievably knowledgable about the material and extremely accessible to address concerns about the class and further explore topics we didn't fully cover outside of class. I highly recommend this course to undergraduates and graduate students alike.</comment>This is a great course where you'll learn a lot about theater and set design. It was truly a privilege to listen to Julia speak on these topics, and I felt like I had a lot to learn from her every class. It's not a stressful class at all, yet I learned a lot. I'd highly recommend this course if you have any interest in theater.</comment>You don't have to be interested in set design to take this course. The class focuses mostly on the different art movements and how they affected theater. It's also almost like a history course--it talks a lot about the stories behind theater emerging in the 20th century which is really interesting.</comment></course>ECON 1035: Market Failure and Government Failure: The Economics of Regulation</title>Professor Rasmusen is really great. The class is built around discussion and I think that I learn best from this. Tons of interesting topics, asymmetric information, immigration, obamacare, etc. makes the class very relevant.</comment>This is not a Harvard class. It does not teach you to think so much as to memorize. Class time was haphazardly prepared. Professor Rasmusen used what one of the tutors in my house called “FSM” for Failed Socratic Method, in which he would call on students who he thought weren’t paying attention (who were normally bored and thus distracted) and asked them either very open or specific but unclear questions with one specific answer in mind. When they came back with a brilliant idea, he would dismiss it as incorrect, as it was not the one that he was thinking of. The material alone is all pretty much from Ec 10, and everyone had, I believe, taken a minimum of Ec 1010.   That said, his research is actually quite interesting, and he pleasant to talk to during office hours.</comment>This class won't be offered again because Prof. Rasmusen is a visiting professor, but: the class is based on really engaging and important topics, but we all kind of got lost in the middle of the class, partly due to unengaging and unfocused lectures and partly due to interjections of irrelevant material like quasi-concavity, etc. Prof. Rasmusen is full of good intentions, but could also be awkward in dealing with younger people.</comment>You may not learn a great deal of new things in this class concerning economics if you have already taking an intro to economics class. However, you will definitely build a more nuanced understanding of basic concepts (which felt valuable), learn a few new things, and really see how economic concepts connect to the real world. Seeing how economists and government officials weigh the economic costs and benefits of regulation was exciting for me and seemed useful as a student of economics.</comment>The topic itself is quite interesting and interdisciplinary, combining economics and public policy. However Professor Rasmusen, as a visiting professor, treated students in a juvenile fashion, failing to challenge us in class and not moving class discussions beyond the information in the textbook.</comment>This does not necessary apply since it was taught by a visiting Professor, but one thing to keep in mind is that the class requires some understanding of intermediate micro economics. Overall, it is not a very demanding course and the professor was always interested in fostering debate.</comment>N/A since class will not be offered in future.</comment>I loved this course, because I think I learned to see issues in a way that's not purely economical nor purely governmental, but both. If this is offered again by the same professor, you should definitely consider shopping and taking it.</comment></course>MATH 114: Analysis II: Measure, Integration and Banach Spaces</title>This class was very difficult. The most inconvenient part was that we had very little feedback (other than on assignments) before the add/drop date, so by the time we took a test and knew how we were doing, it was too late to do anything about it. Professor McMullen takes his classes seriously and seems to underestimate our understanding of the material and you need to be prepared for that.</comment>If McMullen is teaching this class, it will be taught very well, but the course material will be very difficult - make sure to keep up with everything, or you will get lost. The course material is very interesting though.</comment>Great lectures, amazing professor, coherent and challenging problem sets. If McMullen is teaching any course, just take it.</comment>Great introduction to functional analysis!</comment>Highly recommend. Prof. McMullen is a great instructor. His lectures're very clear, elegant. The part I like the most is that he would give his intuitions about those abstract math topics, which is very useful if one wants to understand this subject deeply; and he would relate this course to many other fields, e.g. dynamic systems, number theory, physics.</comment>If McMullen is teaching this course, it will be very hard, but you will learn a ton. I would definitely take it if he is teaching.</comment>This class, though tough, covers a lot of interesting material (especially near the end). McMullen's teaching is very good and made up for some of the other lacking aspects of the course.

The problem sets were often difficult, and rarely could you do them without help from the CA's or other students. Personally, I don't think a problem is instructive it is so hard that you have to get hints every step of the way. 

This class also assumes a good deal of familiarity with basic topology and analysis (presumably taught in Math 23/25). This will be a very difficult class if you do not have at least that level of preparation.</comment>Great class. Mcmullen is amazing, as always. Although it's an undergrad course, surprisingly lot is covered.</comment>Prof. McMullen is a fantastic lecturer and really brought analysis to life in this class. He does have a tendency to move quickly in lecture, so make sure you're paying attention!</comment>When McMullen teaches this course, it is harder than usual.</comment>Professor McMullen is an excellent lecturer, and his problem sets are strange but intriguing. However, I have heard that he is very inflexible when it comes to accommodating students' schedules. He refuses to offer extensions to students who have legitimate excuses, and he is often very ``Curt'' in his emails to students. Compassion toward students is an essential virtue of a good professor, and in taking Math 114 with Professor McMullen, I learned how not to communicate with students in the future. Nonetheless, I would highly recommend this course to anybody who wants a rigorous and complete introduction to real analysis.</comment>Just make sure to stay on top of the material.  Also, don't push your psets to the last minute.</comment>Interesting and difficult material. Professor McMullen has a talent for making the abstract parts interesting/comprehensible. Be ready for some tough stuff, though.</comment>Prof. McMullen will teach you more than anyone else in the department, but he'll make you work your ass off for it. Be warned.</comment>Measure theory is a good subject to know. Developing the Lebesgue integral at the beginning can be slightly tedious, but the second half of the course is a lot of great applications and interesting material on Banach spaces. Professor McMullen's lectures were very well organized and easy to understand. Homework sets usually consisted of 6-8 problems, 4-6 of which were quite quick to solve, and 1-2 very difficult problems that required clever solutions. I do feel like the challenging problems made me better and thinking of clever tricks.</comment>This class is pretty challenging. Try to work hard, spend time on assignments, and read the text book.</comment>If McMullen is teaching this course take it! It is a great class if you enjoyed any of the real analysis from 23/25. McMullen cares about his students, is an amazing lecturer, gives interesting psets and the final exam/midterm are definitely reasonable.</comment>McMullen is a great professor. This class was challenging but I learned a ton.</comment>Take this class if McMullen teaches it again. The lectures and assignments were incredible!</comment>This class was fantastic, and I'd recommend any class with professor McMullen. He really cares about the students and invests a lot of effort into the lectures and lecture notes. It covered many foundational areas of measure theory and functional analysis. There were also lots of interesting, tricky problems.</comment>The course material is very interesting and the instructor was very good, but the class was a bit too difficult.  The pace was very quick and falling behind by a little proved to be fatal.</comment></course>BIOSTAT 249: Bayesian Methodology in Biostatistics</title>This class provides an excellent foundation in Bayesian statistics, but it would be nearly impossible without a strong grasp on both probability theory and regression.</comment>I found this class pretty (unexpectedly) difficult, but I came out with a much deeper understanding of Bayesian concepts and their applications. Do not take this class unless you are truly facile with R and manipulating distributions. Exams and homeworks are very time consuming. Case studies were great and gave a good picture of what Bayes-driven research is happening around the department.</comment>This class introduces the basics of Bayesian statistics in the first half and then illustrates how Bayesian statistics is used in a wide range of applications. Areas of application of Bayesian methods include causal inference, model averaging, and Bayesian non-parametric/semi-parametric methods.</comment></course>ASTRON 301hf: Journal Club</title>as a grad student you have to take this course</comment></course>OEB 216: Modern Conservation Biology</title>A fun and easy survey of some student selected topics in conservation biology, lots of opportunity to share thoughts but not much different than a typical seminar course</comment>This is a wonderful course to learn about conservation. You will have a lot of freedom to learn about topics of your choice. However make sure you put in the effort to participate in discussions</comment>I'd tell students that this class is definitely worth taking for the quality of the discussion, balanced by the relatively light reading and workload.</comment>This was a really fun and interesting class. You really get a chance to delve into the heart of the issues.</comment>Future courses will not probably run in the same format (as the first iteration of the course, the students were actually trading teaching responsibilities each week and our final project was actually to create a syllabus for an intro conservation bio class). Regardless, if Lizzie is still the professor and you will have a nice small class format try to take the course! It was an incredible opportunity to chat in depth about conservation with a mix of interesting and passionate students (undergrad as well as grad). Lizzie also really knows her stuff, and brings in lots of interesting facts and experiences to the conservation :) If you're interested in conservation at all, this is a must-take course at Harvard!</comment></course>ECON 2610: Industrial Organization I</title>I think the empirical IO method is definitely an important skill to have for graduate students in social sciences. It is also becoming more and more mainstream and applicable in other field. Robin Lee is an amazing teacher and researcher, anyone would be lucky to learn from him.</comment>Robin is excellent, and the material is excellent. This is the best class I've taken in grad school.</comment></course>ECON 2142: Time Series Analysis</title>If you are looking for a big picture understanding of time series, this isn't it. If you have a strong background in econometrics and want to understand the technical details of time series methods, this could be a good fit.</comment>Time series background is helpful, particularly in the first weeks. Material is often not as well-motivated as it could be up front, so if you don't know what something is about, google it at the beginning of lecture.</comment>Difficult, but worth taking if you have interest in econometrics and/or macroeconomics.</comment></course>E-PSCI 236: Environmental Modeling</title>This class will teach you to approach many different types of problems (its methods have application way beyond atmospheric science!). You should be comfortable with at least one programming language (MATLAB, R, Python...) to really get the most out of this course.</comment>This class will give you a basic understanding of atmospheric modeling from box to 3-D models.</comment></course>ENG-SCI 256: Informal Robotics / New paradigms for Design and Construction</title>There's a lot of pressure to progress week to week, but you come out of this class having built something awesome. Also the exposure to different aspects of robotics and design is very interesting.</comment></course>VES 270: Proseminar in Film and Visual Studies: History</title>If you're looking for a history of cinema, this isn't the course for you. If you want to get to know one of the most delightful professors around campus, take this course and take advantage of the opportunity to get to know Tom.</comment></course>MED-SCI 302qc: Conduct of Science Refresher</title>It's a large waste of time.</comment>It's not too bad.</comment>It's required, but not too much effort.</comment>I would recommend students to sign up in a small group with a friend or two. Because members of our small group knew one another we were more honest and engaged in our discussions, so we got much more out of it than if we were going through the motions (which may be more likely with strangers).</comment>I was annoyed to be required to take it, but the instructors made it entertaining. I enjoyed the discussion section.</comment></course>ASTRON 99: Senior Thesis in Astrophysics</title>I would recommend writing a thesis to anyone considering graduate school in the future. However, with Professor Alcock, there wasn't much of a class at all. We met very intermittently and didn't even receive a syllabus until halfway through the semester. Despite what it seemed, there were actual assignments with actual due dates.</comment>Be prepared to spend a lot of time (15-20 or even more hours a week), but it's probably the most rewarding thing you'll do. Also, picking the project is key to make sure it is completable.</comment>If you're writing a thesis you have to take this class so this comment won't sway you on that, but just know that your assignments won't be well-explained and you likely won't get any feedback on them.</comment></course>MCB 129: The Brain: Development, Plasticity and Decline</title>While evaluations are not that frequent in this class, I would say the material covered is really really interesting. Dr. Kunes and Emily go out of their way to make themselves accessible, so making full use of them as resources is probably one of the most important parts of this course.</comment>Very laid back class, and papers were very interesting. There's no textbook and the annotated slides can be a bit confusing, so it may be a good idea to brush up on neurobiology before attending the lectures -- preparation like MCB 80 would be useful. Otherwise, workload is very manageable and the content fascinating.</comment>Interesting and well-taught, plus the professor brings snacks! Very understanding teaching staff.</comment>Professor Kunes is so nice and awesome. He does a really really good job of making the class accessible to those without a lot of background in MCB or neuro. The material is interesting and relevant and he explains it very well and also is very helpful if you need help outside of lecture.</comment>The class has a lot of very interesting information and takes a developmental look at the brain, something I haven't really had during my time as a neurobio concentrator. However, the lecturing style might not work well with some people (and its especially difficult to get used to at the beginning, but it does get better later in the course). The professor is super nice and accommodating though</comment>This class was very interesting and a great survey of important topics in developmental neurobiology. Sam is a clear lecturer even if he sometimes runs out of time, and Emily was extremely helpful as a TF. Overall, not much required of you in terms of assignments, but great opportunity to delve deeply into the material if you're interested. Also pastries, apples and coffee every morning!</comment>This is a fantastic class if you're interesting neurobiology and/or development. Sam is an interesting lecturer and he truly respects your ability to pick a topic you enjoy and dive deeply into it out of your own initiative.</comment>I strongly recommend this course! Professor Kunes is wonderful! He is very knowledgable and very approachable. The topics are super interesting even if you do not have a strong background in neurobiology. The assignments are very doable. Make sure to start ahead and meet with Professor Kunes or the TF in advance; they give very helpful feedbacks. Professor Kunes is also very encouraging and fosters a supportive environment for everyone to participate. Lastly, he always brings breakfast for everyone!</comment>A great class looking at primary literature on brain development and change</comment>This class is super chill (Dr. Kunes brings apples, coffee, and sweets every morning), and you get a cool in-depth view of neuro research. It's great for both people with little and people with extensive research backgrounds, and Dr. Kunes and Emily are very approachable and fun to learn from. The midterm and final papers are super interesting -- make sure to make enough time for them and to meet with Dr. Kunes and Emily to learn the most from these opportunities!</comment></course>LAT-STD 70: Modernity, Culture and Politics in Latin America</title>This is a good class in which you learn about a handful of topics related to Latin America. These topics range from oil politics to early 20th century Argentine culture, so you cover a broad range of material both from a social science and from a humanities perspective. It is fairly little work (just a few hours of reading per week).</comment>This class covers topics that would typically not be covered in a Spanish class or a Latin America focused class in any other department. It is definitely worth taking and it isn't very time consuming so it would be a good choice for an elective.</comment>Mariano is an excellent professor and the class is so fun and so interesting and I really learned a lot more than I think I have in most of my other classes here.</comment>good, casual spanish review each week. Low time commitment, great way to get citation credit</comment>I would say the class was meh. Just average. The professor and teaching staff are very amiable and I enjoyed having a space to practice my Spanish.</comment>Read and ask questions! you will get out what you put in</comment>This is an excellent and fun introduction to Latin American Studies. Prof. Siskind is great! I'd recommend any class by him, really.</comment>The material in this course is really interesting.  If you have a strong Spanish background and are interested in learning about Latin America, take this.</comment>This course has a lot of guest lecturers because it covers more topics than any one professor could reasonably lecture on, but be aware that each lecturer picks the readings for their week, so the readings vary a lot. Sometimes they're great, but a lot of times they're long and repetitive. Overall though, a great course!</comment>This is a great class to take if you are beyond instructional Spanish classes. There are a lot of guest lecturers who bring interesting perspectives to the topics and readings. Professor Siskind is funny and a passionate lecturer.</comment></course>GOV 92r: Faculty Research Assistant</title>The quality of the Gov 92r experience is completely up to you and your professor. Pick a professor that you know you will enjoy working with, and select a topic that you will enjoy researching and the experience will be a great one.</comment>You can learn a lot from this course, but make sure it's the right fit for you and that you have clear expectations about what you will be doing.</comment></course>ASTRON 17: Galactic and Extragalactic Astronomy</title>This was a very thorough, and interesting introduction to astronomy. The book was relatively easy though contained a lot of information, but was well explained.</comment>The class is very interesting, its a bit hard to grasp. If you understand the physics and math you will be gold cause you are learning such amazing stuff its just hard when the numbers and equations do not make sense. The lab reports are loooooooooong so do them in advanced, believe me! The homework is challenging, use the office hours. Read the book as much as you can, its long but easy to understand and really cool. This is NOT an easy A class so do not take it if that is what you want, take it if learning about space is interesting to you.</comment>This is a great course. If you want to have your mind blown consistently (almost every class), and are prepared to do some cool physics along the way, then you'll love this class. It explores some of the most conceptually interesting aspects of the entire field of physics - discussing dark matter, dark energy, pre-big bang conditions of the Universe, and everything in between. Professor Eisenstein is a great professor who is super enthusiastic about the material and who loves seeing people understand and succeed. The exams were quite tough, but not unfair. A lot of qualitative and also quantitative materials to study, but it's worth it because you'll walk away from this class feeling like you actually learned something! Not too much workload throughout the year either.</comment>I took this class hoping to gain an understanding of how the Universe works, and how we know what we know about it. The course taught exactly this. If you've ever seen figures like "the mass of the Sun is ____ kg" or "the Universe started with the Big Bang" and wondered how we could possibly know such a thing, this course is for you.  I took this course on top of a difficult schedule and found it fairly manageable. Don't let difficulty dissuade you from taking the course if you're interested (if you're good at high school calculus).</comment>It's a necessary class for Astro concentrators and secondaries. That being said, I wouldn't really recommend this class to those who just have an interest in cosmology (which I venture to guess is a pretty uncommon interest). The course is very punishing scheduling wise, but the material is doable if you go to OH.</comment>If you are looking at this as an elective or gen-ed, there are more glam (and less mathematical) gen-ed astronomy courses.  If you are a concentrator or secondary or enjoy physics problems, the class is of appropriate difficulty and has great problem sets.</comment>Overall this is a pretty solid course. If you are looking for the most introductory astronomy course, I recommend that you take 16, as it covers less material at a slower and more in depth pace. This course was neither too easy nor overwhelmingly difficult. Many concepts in cosmology are difficult to grasp, but the course material is nonetheless very interesting. Overall, the assignments and exams are pretty reasonable. I have definitely taken worse courses.</comment>This class has a lot of great information, but is the worst-run class I've ever taken.  This course single-handedly convinced me to not be an astronomy concentrator.</comment>The material of the class is extremely interesting, and Professor Eisenstein is great! You get to use the Clay telescope on top of the Science Center, as well as the radio telescope at the CfA, which is really cool. However, I thought the different components of the class (i.e. lecture, readings, problem sets, labs) could have been more closely related.</comment>This is a fun, engaging, and informative class. It requires much less prerequisite knowledge than most people believe is needed. Anyone who has taken high school physics and high school calculus is more than prepared for the topics covered in Astro 17. The weekly p-sets are moderate in difficulty, and are usually full of interesting and concrete problems. There are two labs during the semester; this year the first involved observing the Perseus Galaxy cluster on the Clay telescope, and the second involved creating a galactic rotation curve using the radio telescope at the Center for Astrophysics (by the Quad). Both labs were very educational and interesting, though they required an 8-10 page lab writeup. Overall, I was amazed by how much I had learned about the universe by the end of this course. I encourage anyone with the slightest interest in astronomy to take Astro 17.</comment>Its a good intro Astro class. Typical lecture and pset style. Prof. Eisenstein is a good lecturer and sometimes makes funny remarks (ie something about ancient dinosaur astronomers).</comment>Astronomy 17 is an excellent course!  It provides a very strong foundation for Astrophysics.  Professor Eisenstein is a superb professor!</comment>This course was a very nice and thorough introduction to galactic astronomy. The book was fairly easy but qualitatively useful and the math was supplemented in the lectures.</comment>The class covers a wide range of very interesting topics, and in my opinion, Professor Eisenstein is an effective lecturer. As a physics concentrator with no background in Astronomy, I found that Eisenstein has very different methods of thinking about problems than the methods I have encountered in physics, which has definitely widened my perspective. I would recommend this class to anyone with an interest in Astronomy!</comment>Unless you plan on concentrating in Astronomy, this course is probably not for you.  I took it hoping to explore a topic I had little background in just because I always thought that astronomy was a cool and interesting field.  However, the problem sets were very challenging and tedious, having more to do with equations and rearranging them than actual astronomical ideas.  Moreover, the two labs in the class, though fun and interesting to perform in the laboratory, required 10-page write-ups, which really weren't necessary given the simplicity of the actual lab results.</comment>This is an awesome class! It was way better than Astro 16, and I feel like I learned an immense amount. I definitely still have questions, but I feel like I'm in a much better place in terms of actually understanding how the Universe works than I was at the beginning of the semester. Don't take this course just for the qualitative material, though. A few of the PSets were a bit tricky, though most were very straightforward, and overall the math/physics portion is the main focus of the course. The labs were pretty cool too, though definitely not as cool as the ones in Astro 16 were, which was a bit of a letdown. Overall, this class is super rewarding and should definitely be taken while you're at Harvard - don't miss out!</comment>This class was pretty good! It is very well organized and well structured, but there is a lot of work, so keeping up is incredibly important. The textbook tends to change every time this class is taught, but generally they're smooth and informative reads. That said, as a very structured class, there isn't much room for deviation and/or creativity on homeworks and labs: grading and comments can be VERY nit-picky. However, all in all, this was an extremely interesting experience. Eisenstein's lectures are all fairly good and he answers questions extremely clearly and well. I recommend it highly!</comment>Pay attention and make sure you are awake fore every lecture. I found that going over notes after class was really helpful because sometimes it fells as though Prof. Eisenstein is going off in tangents but in reality he is explaining everything in a very detailed manner (so its is easy to loose track of what he is talking about).</comment></course>HIST 2495: Politics and Social Movement in the 20th Century United States: Research Seminar</title>Excellent preparation for writing dissertation chapters.</comment>I would absolutely recommend this class to someone with a clear project and a desire to dive into research and writing. Do not take the class if you don't have the time to dedicate to it. It's a lot of work, but worth it!</comment></course>CHEM 301hf: Scientific Teaching and Communications: Practicum</title>Take it seriously!</comment>It's useful to practice before starting the real teaching.</comment>This class gets students to talk about science in front of a class, which is an important first step in developing sound teaching skills. What you get out of this class will be directly proportional to what you put into it.</comment>It's certainly easy to put minimal effort in this class, but I suggest that you don't – this is a great way to improve your teaching in a low-key environment, so definitely use it! You can definitely put effort in without it being too stressful. It's also nice to see everyone in your cohort regularly :)</comment>It's a great way to get an introduction to how to be a good teacher (from some of the best teachers around) before getting started with teaching yourself.</comment>Chemistry 301 is an introduction to becoming a teaching fellow at Harvard.  The class offers opportunities to become comfortable teaching by practicing in a relaxed environment with fellow chemistry graduate students.</comment>Good for students who have no experience in teaching, but boring and redundant for those with any experience.</comment>be open! and confident!</comment></course>SLAVIC 98: Tutorial - Junior Year</title>Truly fantastic course. Readings are light (we only read 4 short stories over the course of the term), though Gogol's language necessitates frequent use of a dictionary. I feel like I truly got to know not only Gogol the writer (and he's probably the most fantastically inventive stylist I've ever read), but also Gogol as he was interpreted by all the zany critics who have tried to make sense of him ever after. The critical readings are almost as fascinating as the stories, by the way, so don't skip them.</comment></course>BIOSTAT 235: Advanced Regression and Statistical Learning</title>The lectures are very dry and boring, but on the other hand they are very clear and detailed. The slides are very thorough on their own, but so dense it might be hard to read them without attending the lectures. Take this class if you want to understand the full theory of linear regression, and solid amount of machine learning stuff too (lasso, SCAD, cross validation, etc). Don't take it if you only want to know how to apply various predictive models. Make sure you are very strong in linear algebra before the class, and get a copy of Hastie/Tibshirani... Elements of Statistical Learning for the second half of the class. It is a useful supplement to the lecture slides.</comment>It is very helpful for understanding statistics.</comment>This is an essential course on the theory of linear models and modern regression methods including LASSO, PCA, etc. It also helps develop familiarity with techniques to solve analytical and computational problems in these areas.</comment></course>NEUROBIO 101hfm: Fundamentals of Computational Neuroscience</title>Do take this if you are interested in computational neurobiology--it's one of the only opportunities to be introduced to the field at the undergraduate level, and it's a well-designed survey of various major topics.</comment>Great class! The small class, led by Alexander and Ashesh who are really knowledgeable and also very caring, will allow you to learn a whole lot.</comment>Recommended only for people genuinely curious about the computational part of neuroscience! This class is a way to jump in the deep end for those who don't have much experience with math, and a wonderful way to explore neuro for those who do. Alexander and Ashesh are amazing individuals and super approachable, but we still need to work out a way to balance the class between the math experts and the novices.</comment>This is a great introduction to computational neuroscience! Ashesh and Alex are both really cool, and the material is very interesting. There were a couple of aspects of the course that may have been slightly suboptimal, such as spending a little too much class time talking about programming assignments and student presentations and not enough time covering new material. However, in general this course is quite good, particularly considering this is the first time this course is offered. I highly recommend it.</comment>A tough class, but you'll learn a lot more than any other Neuro class I've taken so far.</comment></course>PHYSICS 16: Mechanics and Special Relativity</title>Take this course if you have a strong background in physics and want to spend a semester with smart peers solving difficult problems and deepening your understanding of physics. It's not a course where you learn material but rather approaches and skills.</comment>This is an extremely difficult class. At times it can be demoralizing as you realize you're not nearly as good at physics as you thought you were. With that said, if you're willing to put in the time, it's very rewarding.</comment>It's the perfect class for students who are genuinely passionate about physics and motivated just by their passion for studying the subject.</comment>The class is challenging, but extremely rewarding. I absolutely recommend it if you plan on concentrating in physics. In a way, it's a right of passage - if you finish this course on top of the material (certainly doable with the appropriate physics background), studying physics no longer seems as daunting.</comment>Definitely worth it if you're willing to put in the hours, but it might take over your life!</comment>This is an excellent course. Professor Georgi is an extraordinarily kind person and is very willing to conference with students. That said, lecture is often difficult to follow, and Professor Georgi often will not answer questions fully. Going to section is very important if you hope to come out of the class understanding everything (plus TF's are great). Beware, the course is very difficult and gets progressively more so over the semester. That said, in retrospect I have learned a great deal in a rather short time and have absolutely enjoyed the class.</comment>A lot of work! Be careful!</comment>If you're interested in physics, this is a great course. If you're interested in another quantitative field such as math or computer science, this course might be a tad difficult, as you need to put in a good amount of time to fully understand the material. Honestly, the course is probably worth the challenge regardless, but watch your time commitments especially if this is not going to be the class that you focus on the most.</comment>Physics 16 is definitely a one-of-a-kind class. The systems that you look at make classical mechanics at least somewhat interesting, and you will learn a lot about how to look at problems more conceptually (make sure that you understand Taylor Series - Professor Georgi loves to ask about how systems will evolve for small times because it gives you a greater conceptual feel for how different parts of the system interact). However, much of the learning will be done on your own. If you really want to learn the material, you will not be able to rely upon lecture (in fact, lecture may do more to confuse you than to help you understand the material). You will have to read the textbook, you will have to go to section, and you will have to spend a long time on the problem sets. That being said, you will not be bored. If you really love physics, then this is a class that you should take. Again, though, you will have to teach a lot of the material to yourself.</comment>There is a lot of interesting physics, if you are willing to deal with homework assignments that fairly regularly contain errors that you or another student have to catch.</comment>It's stressful and time-consuming but you'll learn a lot.</comment>It's an interesting class at the beginning, but unless it is the only hard class you are taking, and perhaps even so, not entirely worth the time commitment.</comment>Very intense and interesting, though much of the learning is more on the student's own rather than in class</comment>If you are interested in physics even slightly, I would definitely recommend to take this course. It may be a lot of work depending on your physics background, but the Physics 16 environment is very cooperative and helpful as long as you keep up your work. Morin's classical mechanics book is essential for this class. If the words 4-vector, Euler-Lagrange equations, and nutation seem unfamiliar but interesting to you, definitely check it out. In the worst case, you can always drop down to 15a as I have seen my peers doing so without much problem.</comment>I really enjoyed almost every aspect of this class except for lecture. Georgi is great, but I found it much more useful to read through the textbook than to actually learn in lecture.</comment>How much you like this class will probably depend on what kind of way you like to learn. This isn't a class for someone who enjoys strong lectures that you have to focus during, nor necessarily someone who just enjoys playing with the math. The lectures add value in their physical intuition. Georgi spends classes trying to make you think physically about everything, and understand it logically rather than mathematically. This made it really a poor class for me: I prefer to see derivations in class, and see how different things follow from the easier structure, rather than rely on physical intuition. In retrospect, I wish I'd started with 143. However, I'm also very lazy about doing readings and generally don't care about the physics of the situation. I think that this class is very valuable to someone who does care about those things. And the PSets, along with physics night, are really great ways to learn the material. I'd highly recommend the class if you happen to be interested in the real mechanics.</comment>This class is really fun if doing physics for 10-15 hours a week sounds fun to you. If you're debating between 15a and 16, I have friends in 15a and I would say that what really sets 16 apart is the collaboration. Almost no one in the class can complete the psets alone so we all work together and some of my strongest friendships freshman year grew out of physics night. Georgi genuinely cares about undergraduates which is awesome. You will learn to think about physics on a whole other level from high school. There is so much more to mechanics than boring plug and chug.</comment>This class isn't nearly as hard as it is advertised to be. If you know what you're doing, no pset should take you longer than a few hours, and Morin is very helpful in walking you through the psets. Don't worry about an insane workload prior to enrolling in this class. (Disclaimer: I had a significantly stronger math and physics background coming into the course than the average student.)
That said, it is a good opportunity for you to meet similarly math/science-oriented peers (I met many friends through Physics 16) and it does expand your knowledge of classical mechanics and relativity. It is almost certainly a better option than either 15a or 151 for the reasonably strong student.
If you want to prepare somewhat, brushing up or learning elementary differential equations (e.g. the harmonic oscillator equation) and some multivariate calculus isn't a bad idea. 
I heard some interesting stories about the final project; this shouldn't affect whether or not you take the course, but do be careful.</comment>This course is tough! And Georgi can be frustrating at times - he's just so brilliant that he has very high expectations of his students. However, it's worth taking; you feel incredibly accomplished once you're finished.</comment>It's a fantastic course people who want to learn physics deeply, who already have strong Mechanics backgrounds, to explore fun (new!) topics and get to know each other. The topics are fascinating and need-to-know ideas that are almost never explored in introductory physics. Although some people might be familiar with many of the topics covered already, it's also just a great way to get plugged into the community.</comment>This class will push your physics and problem solving abilities and also introduce a number of useful and advanced topics in mechanics and relativity.  The lectures were difficult to relate back to the readings and assignments though, so section and strong independent learning are vital.</comment>WARNING, PLEASE READ THIS.  Physics 16 is a very, VERY demanding course. It will expose you to great depth to a lot of interesting high level physics but the course is designed to make you not learn everything. First of all, 16 definitely does not provide you with a strong physical intuition, which I think is very important and is something that I could not acquire, because most of the time you will be lost in complicated math problems. You will most of the time feel in the void because you will not have an idea as to how to start a pset because it is just complicated math.

Georgi is also, though a wonderful physics genius, is a HORRIBLE TEACHER. He consistently does not teach content that he asks on the psets and lectures are mostly waste of time because he is either introducing basic concepts or is talking about incomprehensible stuff you won't get at all.

If you are a student who likes to ask questions like me, DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. Georgi will either tell you to "Read the question again" or "Think about the physics" if you ask a question about the pset. The TFs are usually helpful but Georgi makes it the case that they cannot help you out for psets.

What I especially did not like was that the course makes it the case that you have to depend on other people to be able to finish the psets. There was literally only one student in our class who could finish the pest on his own. The rest of us had to mooch off from each other to finish psets, and I mostly did not learn much by struggling on my own because I had to ask other friends for help all the time. 

Take 15a instead if you did not have a calculus-based physics class. David Morin is an awesome instructor and you will actually learn physics.</comment>The material is probably more interesting than Physics 15a, but it's way over-hyped. If you take this class, which I would still recommend if you have a background in physics already, you should expect to learn most of the material from Morin's textbook and do a lot more algebra than physics on the problem sets.</comment>This class is very hard but very rewarding. It challenged me like no class I have ever taken before and made my freshman fall a great experience. Not only did my knowledge of mechanics and relativity greatly increase, I also became a better problem-solver and became more comfortable tackling difficult problems and overcoming obstacles along the way. Professors Georgi is fantastic, and obviously cares very deeply about his students. He takes the time to learn everybody's names and stays up until 1 am in Leverett dining hall on Wednesday nights to help students with their psets. You will need a very strong background in physics and math (5 on AP physics C or equivalent, experience with multivariable calculus and linear algebra isn't strictly required but would be useful). If you have this background, however, take this class! It was my favorite class of my freshman fall and I met many great friends. You will become a physics 16 family as you struggle with psets together. At the very least, start in this class, and you can always drop down to 15a (it's at the same time) if you are overwhelmed.</comment>This class is much more driven by complex problems than by complex topics. Many of the topics (though not all of them) will be similar to a well taught APC high school physics course, however the problems will be much harder. For most people in the class (but not everybody), this class is quite time consuming - so be ready to dedicate a significant number of hours to textbook reading and problem sets.</comment>It is very difficult, but the outcome is worth the effort.</comment>It's very hard, but very worth it.</comment>It's a very tough course, for sure. But if you utilize the physics night well the psets wouldn't be too difficult to finish; just make sure you're on top of the material each week, as material tend to accumulate and you might be on week 9 with no idea what is going on.</comment>The majority of the value of the course could just as well be obtained by reading through the Morin textbook. The psets did little to help my understanding and were more of a chore than anything. The lectures were dull and uninformative. I did not enjoy this course overall.</comment>Most of the learning of the material is done through textbook readings, rather than lectures. If this is ok with you, then this class is fine for you. Psets have a reasonable length and difficulty.</comment>It's a good class for people who are passionate about physics. The class gives you a very good foundation and introduction to solving very difficult problems, and you pretty much have to work with others to figure out the psets. That being said, I didn't really learn much physics; it's more about applying physics that you probably already know (a couple exceptions) to very difficult problems. If you like that, you'll love the class; if you get annoyed at complicated problems for the sake of complication, be forewarned. If, however, you plan on doing physics, definitely take this. Otherwise, make sure this is what you want :)</comment>This course is primarily for meeting people, keep that in mind when yo do that. 70% of the material you might already know the core of from AP Physics and stuff and you definitely go deeper into everything, which is sometimes interesting. You also need to not be afraid of complicated and confusing math because it comes up a lot. I feel like i undersell this course when I really enjoyed it and made a lot of friends.</comment>The class could be better taught, but for anyone even remotely interested in concentrating in physics this class is an amazing choice. The problem sets are beautiful, although a bit intimidating at first, and the textbook used to cover the material is incredible. The teaching staff is also readily available to help anyone, and Professor Georgi has some of the most open office hours of any professor.</comment>I think that this class is incredibly helpful in determining whether or not you are interested in pursuing theoretical physics. I personally didn't find the material to be incredibly interesting and now realize that I don't want to spend my time studying this. However, I have peers that did and are now more excited about continuing to pursue physics than ever. Your experience in the class definitely depends on your personal interest.</comment>Physics 16 is definitely an experience. There are times when you might be frustrated by the level of messiness of some of the pset problems, but overall, the psets are challenging but get you to think about the physics. You should be prepared to devote Wednesday nights solely to physics (and more time during the rest of the week of course). Georgi really is a great person, albeit not the best lecturer. You should try to get to know him and the TFs (they are usually very good for this class). And of course, you get to know a lot of really smart people in the class itself, which is great during your freshman fall.</comment>Take this class if you are seriously considering doing physics. Professor Georgi is a terrible lecturer but an amazing man and a great resource for the class. You will learn and do fantastic things.</comment>You probably know if you want a challenging and rewarding experience in physics.</comment>More than just amazing learning, this course has what I'm pretty sure is a unique emphasis on getting to know the other people in the college who like hard science. Everyone really bonds over the homework during physics night which makes for a great community. Also, the learning is top notch; Georgi will force you to really think about what is happening when you solve a physics problem.</comment>I would say that the course material and the thinking skills you develop in this class are very valuable. Don't be discouraged by Georgi's scattered and sometimes hard to follow lectures, just make sure that you read the textbook and don't leave everything until physics night!</comment>Physics 16 is an amazing course! Yes, you learn a lot. Yes, it's a lot of hard work for something who's coming from an average math/physics background, but if you really enjoy physics and want to really learn how to approach physics, then this is a fantastic class. There is so much collaboration with classmates, you meet great people, and Georgi is an amazing resource. He really cares and wants you to learn.</comment>This class is not about the lecture or the material, it is all about the problems. If you love complex physics problems, and don't care as much about understanding, this is the class for you. But if you want a really deep understanding of the material, you may find the p-sets to just be a bunch of annoying mathematical tricks.</comment>This is an amazing class where you will meet wonderful, nice, smart people and dramatically increase your aptitude for physics and problem-solving in general. I recommend that you have a good understanding of physics mechanics with calculus (such as is tested on the Physics C: Mechanics AP Exam), but beyond that, any level of preparation is sufficient to succeed in this class provided you are interested in the material. Even if you feel like you don't understand the problem sets the first week or two, stick with it and you will watch yourself and your confidence improve so much over the course of the semester. The teaching staff and your fellow students are always willing to assist you, and often, your fellow students become your most important teachers, leading to lasting friendships being made in this class. I highly recommend this course to any science or math concentrator, because this course is more than just about the physics, it's about applying what you know to various situations and learning how to understand various phenomena intuitively.</comment>I was not exactly prepared to take this course. But, I'm glad I did. I didn't do very well the whole way through, but the community it built amongst the students really helped me understand both the mathematical and physical concepts that were initially way above my head (which were very cool!)

I would be cautious with Georgi, though. He seems like a cuddly old man, and is in person, but via email he gets passive aggressive very quickly. He also seems to have a set way he understands things, and so if you understand the concept differently and try to explain it to him it won't work very well.</comment></course>ISLAMCIV 178: Muslim Societies in South Asia: Religion, Culture, and Identity</title>This class truly teaches you about the world and how religion is still a huge cultural force behind culture and society, both past and present.</comment>I enjoyed this course because I was interested in the materials been covered. The course is well structured, and Prof. Asani makes great effort to know his students and helps them tailor what they want to take away from the course.</comment>Learning from Professor Asani is such a treat!</comment>This class has changed the way I think about the effect religion has on culture, politics and society. If you at all interact with religion in scholarship, the skills you learn in this class will help you have a more complete picture.</comment></course>FRSEMR 24g: A Brief History of Surgery</title>This class is really a lot of fun! The subject material and instructor are really interesting people. He seems to really enjoy teaching the class and getting to know his students in his own way.</comment>This course gives each participant access to opportunities that otherwise might be difficult to come by (guest speakers, museum tours, anatomy labs) but lectures tend to be moderately confusing, a bit irrelevant.</comment>Make sure not to miss the field trips! They are, by far the best parts of the course and provide great hands-on experience that relates to the content of the readings and discussions.</comment>This seminar was the highlight of my freshman fall. It was so interesting and low stress. I learned so much without any pressure of hard readings or difficult assignments. It definitely strengthened my interest in surgery. Dr. Millham is so smart and funny too; he makes the class interesting with his sense of humor and personal stories from the ER. I would recommend for anyone who has the opportunity to take this class!</comment>This class is very awesome and the professor is amazing and knows what he teaches very well, and teaches it in an entertaining way.</comment>This class is great! I was initially very hesitant about taking a Freshman Seminar in Fall, but I do not regret my decision at all. In my opinion, the field trips were the best part of the class. In particular, the anatomy lab was an incredible--once in a (freshman) lifetime opportunity.</comment>If you are even moderately interested in surgeries or medicine, this is the class to take. Dr. Millham is an amazing teacher and the field trips are so exciting (if you don't mind seeing cadavers).</comment>It's an interesting angle which I was not used to.  For science lovers, you take on surgery from a historical perspective, but still get to dip your feet into the scientific side.</comment></course>VES 107: Studies of the Built North American Environment since 1580</title>Difficult to get in, but intriguing subject matter.</comment>Professor Stilgoe is marvelous. I feel like I learned more from this class than any other course I've taken at Harvard. Lecture is always worth attending. Professor Stilgoe's notes at the beginning of each lecture really provide insight into the news occurring in the world at large and how it relates to us students. The slides themselves are beautiful and thought-provoking. Lastly, visit him during Office Hours! He loves getting to know you and genuinely wants to do whatever he can for his students. Take this course!!!!</comment>This course was either the very best or absolute worst class I have taken at Harvard. John Stilgoe's mind is a whirling dervish (with apologies to the dervish), flitting from throwing knives, to ladies perfume, to cyber terrorism, to his own personal relationships. The class is an intellectual space odyssey with no telling which wormhole Stilgoe might plunge into on a daily basis. The man is the stuff that legends are made of; take the class and become a part of the mythology.</comment>Amazing class. Amazing professor - especially if you are open and honest. The reading, though many don't do it, should be done because it's so interesting.</comment>This class teaches you how to look and how to learn. You won't regret it. Take Stilgoe's other classes too. Office hours is a huge plus.</comment>I almost feel guilty telling you that you MUST TAKE THIS COURSE (which is absolutely true) because it's highly likely that you will not even get into it. This is sad, but a reality, and it's kind of like Harvard as a whole. There is no sense in denying that it is amazing to spare the feelings of those who for one reason or another do not get to enjoy it. 

But, if you are lucky enough to be admitted to the course, know that you are in for quite a ride. You will find yourself wanting to write down everything that Professor Stilgoe says, but at the same time you want to simply sit and listen and absorb it all. The best cure for this is to take notes during lecture and then attend office hours before or after class and do your sitting and absorbing there. 

This course is the antidote for students who have burned out from dry videotaped lectures and girls snickering behind you about their mixer last night. It is the remedy for other students who simply cannot stand one more half-witted superficial comment in section. It is a course that requires you to engage with uncomfortable truths, but will reward you by honing a more keen observational sense along the way.

This is Harvard as it was, as it should be, and as I hope it will be once more.</comment>This class...where do I begin. I had no idea what was going on for about two months, as 'landscape history' is interpreted extremely liberally or simply ignored during most lectures. We talked about bad girls, killing people with antique cutlasses, robbing jewelry stores with drones, seducing Swedish women through unconventional aphrodisiacs and the strategic use of speedos. We also learned a bit about Professor Stilgoe's love life. But despite the unconventional content, I enjoyed the class thoroughly and I think I learned quite a bit without quite being able to define what that was. If you have a particular interest in 'landscape history' as a discipline, read the books carefully, as the lectures may leave you confused. But I'd say, as a whole, go for it.</comment></course>PHYSICS 123: Laboratory Electronics</title>This was a great class! I found the analog material a little more interesting than the digital half, but there was plenty to learn in both parts. 123 gave me a new appreciation for some of the problems of electronic design, and I have already been able to apply the concepts from the class to labwork. Tom is a great teacher, Randall and Hiro were great TFs, and the course material is largely clear and comprehensive. My main difficulty in the class was distilling hundreds of pages of notes (many of which we never mentioned) into key concepts, but the problem sets help with that. Find a good lab partner early and come to Sunday sections!</comment>This class moves at a breakneck pace, but that only means you'll leave this class knowing a whole lot of new things. Be prepared to do the readings and put in the work in lab--and it will pay off!</comment>This class is awesome, but hard! Very time-consuming. You will get an enormous amount out of it if you have time to put a lot into it. You will still get quite a lot out of it even if you don't have tons of time. Not like any other physics class you likely have taken here.</comment>This class is a lot of work - but I'm sure you have heard that over and over. Don't let that scare you away though. It is an awesome experience and you will not regret taking it. Tom is an amazing professor - really engaged and knows his stuff. Always available to help. The course staff really wants you to make it through and succeed, so if you are on the fence, TAKE IT. Find good lab buddies to do the psets and commiserate though :).</comment>Hard to keep up-- read the chapters before class! That being said, this is a great class if you want to learn instrumentation, circuit analysis/design, debugging, etc.</comment>This class is a very significant time commitment because of its long labs. However, those very labs may well be the most fun part of your week - building, designing, and witnessing a plethora of electronic gadgets is extremely rewarding - and in any case, it is work that is very different in character than that in many other classes. You will learn a lot, and you will feel empowered.</comment></course>SOC-WORLD 34: The Caribbean: Globalization, Socio-Economic Development & Cultural Adaptation</title>This is a great SW class. If you are looking for an easy class that does not require that much work, take this class! Orlando is funny and gives great lectures that are easy to understand. The only problem with this class is that it is very back loaded, with a final paper and final exam worth 60% of your grade. Other than the last two weeks of the semester though the class has essentially no work (readings are not necessary if you pay attention to lectures) and section is solely discussion based. The paper can be anything you want about the Caribbean, so if you pick a topic you like, it is not that bad. The final is not overly difficult and they don't try to trick you with unnecessarily hard questions.</comment>This class is as hard as you make it. I was really interested in some topics and not interested in others and I did the readings accordingly. Final paper and final exam is annoying, but considering the only other requirement is a 1 hour midterm, it's hard to complain. As someone from the Caribbean, I didn't necessarily agree with everything Patterson said, but all in all the course was a good survey of the history and culture of the region.</comment>Professor Patterson is amazing. He has a rich history behind him and a lot of knowledge to share with students. This is one of the only classes on Caribbean studies at the college to the best of my knowledge. If you are from the Caribbean or just interested in the area it is a fun, easy and interesting introduction to many of the issues and culture surrounding the region. Section slightly useful, lectures also recorded. Overall a great course and as someone of Caribbean descent interested in economics and development was one of my favorite courses here. I am grateful I was able to find it.</comment>Make sure you think about these things as a sociology course</comment>This class has interesting subject matter and is not difficult at all.</comment>It was a really good class and the information I learned really backed my prior knowledge of the course. The readings aren't extremely important but they are really interesting! Definitely recommend if you have family or there is a strong caribbean presence next to you.</comment>This class is kind of a gem throughout the year, and you're learning about cool information that is relevant to where many students come from. However, come finals, you will have a final paper AND a final exam, which really sharply contradicted its gem status throughout the year. Overall, very enjoyable and low stress.</comment>Great, easy way to fulfill the SW Gen-Ed! I didn't do the readings and did fine, I did go to lecture bc I loved Professor Patterson but if you don't want to go, the lectures are recorded. Ethan is the best TF so try to go with him, and don't be afraid to ask questions in class!</comment>This is a very engaging, interesting class that presents some essential survey knowledge about the Caribbean. You definitely get out of it what you put in - you could scrape by with minimal work, but you'll find yourself fascinated by the questions.</comment>This course is not as much of a gem as it seems. The final paper is much more demanding than you expect, and the final is a bit more stressful. It is cool that lectures are taped and whatnot, but I cannot stress enough that this course is not really a gem. That being said, it was a great course to learn a ton about the history of the caribbean.</comment>This is a great course. Patterson is a very fun and awesome professor. Make sure to focus on what interests you and the essay will be easy.</comment>This course is very easy until the last two weeks. Readings are not necessary to do well on the midterm paper, and the research paper can be very focused and independent of class work. The final exam is cumulative, however, so this tends to stack up at the end.</comment>I really enjoyed this class. If the Caribbean interests you or if you want to use it as a case study for understanding why certain societies are the way they are, I think this is the perfect class.</comment>Definitely worth taking.</comment>If you're looking for an easy way to satisfy Soc-World, take this class. Lectures are taped, sections recap lecture material, you can get by without really doing the readings, and the only assignments are a midterm, 10 page final paper, and final exam. If you're interested in the material, even better!</comment>This course is great! Orlando Patterson is an amazing and interesting teacher who knows almost everything about the Caribbean. The readings are simple and the homework is super chill. If you need an easy Societies of the World GenEd, then take this one!</comment>I LOVED this class! I learned so much about my heritage and other Caribbean countries! Definitely take this. Professor Paterson is amazing and adorable in class. I recommend it a million times over.</comment>Hope your TF is Ethan; if not, he puts his section slides online. The paper deadline also comes up quicker than you think.</comment>If you're interested in the material, I would recommend the course.  It's neat to take a class from a Professor as renowned as Patterson.  Sections are a little too read-off-the-Powerpoint in style, but the information is organized.</comment>Lectures are easy to grasp. Readings aren't truly necessary. Workload is minimal. Take this class if you want to learn something new and want to have fun doing it.</comment>Prepare for the final essay, and block out a lot of time for the final.  They catch up quick and hit you hard if you're not prepared.</comment>Take this class if you're genuinely interested in the region. If not, it's tough to stay engaged.</comment></course>STAT 170: Quantitative Analysis of Capital Markets</title>This class really has some interesting material, but I personally found the disorganization of the course difficult to overcome, and something that affected by ability to learn effectively. Be aware of this before you enroll.</comment>There were aspects of this course that were interesting and then there were aspects of this course that were tedious and seemingly worthless. Lectures constantly toggle back and forth between really easy to follow and impossible to follow. That being said, this class is worth taking to expose yourself to common financial models, if that is your cup of tea. The assignments are semi-interesting and the exams are super easy.</comment>Come to every lecture. Neil is a great lecturer.</comment>Neil is a great teacher and he really understand what he is doing, but his slides can be very confusing sometimes. So try best not to skip classes, otherwise would be very difficult to catch up.  Justin is a great TF and he knows his business. He is very helpful in sessions, so make sure to go. Only thing is that he has very strong personality and sometimes losses patience.</comment>This is a difficult class, but definitely worth the effort. It's an excellent follow-up to Stat 110/123 and is one of the few classes around that covers quantitative finance. Prior knowledge of R would be helpful.</comment>Professor Shephard is an amazing lecturer. Be prepared to work hard (especially coding in R). I took Stat 123 last year, and felt this course was a great extension</comment></comment>The material is really interesting. Neil is a great lecturer and makes the material pretty accessible, but unless you're a statistics whiz with strong knowledge of matrix calculus and a great R programmer, this class will wreck you. It's more than 60% grad students too so say goodbye to your GPA. In retrospect, great class to take pass/fail for the stat major.</comment>This class ultimately does not deliver on what is promised. The math is complicated but unenlightening, and the course doesn't flow smoothly in terms of tying everything together. You will learn a few pricing models, and you will learn how to derive black scholes, and become quite familiar with properties of brownian motion, and of martingales. You will also code various finical processes and constructions such as Markowitz portfolios. The problem with the class is that it presents the material as more of a hodge podge of methods, and doesn't tie things together well. It is not difficult though if you are competent in mathematics</comment>I work in the economic policy field, and this course helped me a lot to grasp many concepts concerning financial market/modelling. I struggled a lot because I wasn't properly equipped with the math behind it, but exam after exam I found the learning extremely rewarding. I strongly recommend it to other Business school and Kennedy school students -- the marginal benefit will be particularly high for you.</comment>This course has interesting material, but it is not taught particularly well.  The section component of the course was pretty unhelpful, and the TF held his office hours at an inconvenient time (Monday morning at 9am).  Half of the students taking the class were grad students, and undergrads are graded on the same level, making it difficult to perform well in the course.</comment>Although this is a challenging course, it is definitely worth putting your time into it. You'll learn a lot by the end of the semester and surprise yourself with how much you can do.</comment></course>EXPOS 20.063: Gothic Fiction</title>I would tell future students to really get into the material the class covers. What I mean by this is, students should become interested in what they are reading about and thoughtfully analyze what is going on. Also, do not be afraid to share your thoughts in class because this is a great way to check your understanding of the work.</comment>The workload can be difficult at times, but in the end it is a very rewarding experience.</comment>Put in a lot of effort on Response Papers and do all of the readings for class. This will prepare you to write full essays and help you get the most out of class time.</comment>This expos was my first choice and definitely did not disappoint. The material was fascinating. The professor was very knowledgeable and insightful yet unpretentious. She gave great feedback and provided ample opportunity for class discussion. If you are interested in fiction, take this class. Even if you are not, definitely consider this class, because I don't think you will find a better expos.</comment>If you enjoy Gothic fiction, then this is a great class. We had lively discussions about a subject that everyone seemed to be interested in. The authors that we discussed were great and the stories were sufficiently creepy.</comment>Take this class if you plan to do a lot of literary writing in college. Otherwise, choose a theme that's more applicable to your interests.</comment>If you like reading Poe you'll love this course.  However, the section on Jane Austen is a bit grueling, especially considering it covers her very early work.</comment>This is a very good course overall, but do not take this if you don't like Gothic literature or don't find it interesting enough to write about. The preceptor is great, especially in terms of reachability and ease of communication, however her feedback (which is great once she has graded the draft/revision) is not very helpful in the actual writing process.</comment>The readings for this class are very dense and often difficult to get through.  And then, it feels like a waste of time to read them, because we barely (if at all) discuss them in class.  I would definitely NOT recommend this class.</comment>Don't believe what random people tell you, this class does not require that much reading.  There was only one point during the semester where I felt overwhelmed with reading.  Professor Bellanca literally wrote the book about how to write college essays so she really knows her stuff!  Overall, this class is extremely manageable and pretty interesting considering its an Expos 20 class.  I highly recommend it.</comment>We read a lot of great works. Think carefully about time management, and take advantage of the resources available to you (such as office hours, email, draft and response paper feedback).</comment></course>FRSEMR 38t: Beethoven's String Quartets</title>This course was absolutely fabulous, and I'd recommend it wholeheartedly. As a freshman seminar, the workload was quite manageable, but you definitely learn an incredible amount about Beethoven and his quartets all in the context of Vienna and the western musical canon as a whole. I liked how this course combined the theoretical with the practical - we broke down the bizarre harmonies in one quartet movement, and then heard it played live in class by a quartet composed of fellow students. The course accommodates a wide range of musical experience and interests; there were members of the class who favored discussions on complicated theory concepts, and those who were more interested in the history of Beethoven or aesthetic appreciation of the music - all were interested and engaged in this class.</comment>This was a very specific, specialized class but is very much worth it and very enjoyable if Beethoven and String Quartets interest you!</comment>It's very fun, you learn a lot about beethoven and basically get to listen to beautiful music for grades!</comment>Very relaxing, with very little outside preparation from class to class apart from listening to the quartets. The subject matter is great, and the final project presentations are laid back and generally interesting. The class is pretty well-taught. I definitely gained a broader understanding of the quartets, works with which I was already very familiar at the beginning of the semester.</comment>It's good if you're a music nut.</comment>All-around wonderful class that gets you closely acquainted with undoubtedly one of the greatest collections of music ever written. Very little pressure since it is a seminar, plus Prof. Shreffler is extremely warm, inviting, and open to ideas. Workload consists of weekly one-page listening notes, one short blog posting, and a final paper or project. Definitely a must-take if you are a classical music enthusiast!</comment>If you are interested in Beethoven as a composer, and did not previously have a chance to encounter his quartets, as opposed to his symphonic works, the seminar is a great way to observe and study his string quartets.</comment></course>MATH 230a: Differential Geometry</title>Make sure to try to picture all the concepts in class--this makes understanding and remembering them a lot easier.</comment>I'm from physics, so good course in general but maybe not so useful for most physicists not in mathsy physics</comment>Hiro is a great teacher who is very enthusiastic about what he teaches. I like how he tries to give an intuitive explanation for things, and in particular, tries to contextualize what we're learning in a broader framework (story times). I wish at times he would be a bit more grounded, i.e. stay close to a text that we can refer to along with the class (as his notes are at times a bit difficult to read), but all in all a pretty solid introductory course.</comment>Take this course if you want to learn some really cool math.</comment></course>JAPNLIT 140: The Literature of Protest in Modern Japan</title>The course introduced me to a wide range of authors, works and history that I knew nothing about. In particular political engagement felt very meaningful, a reminder that academic work is very much a part of the wider world.</comment>Always do the readings, they are very interesting and discussion can be really productive</comment>Loved this course. As a student with no prior experience in Japanese literature beyond a very area-specific set of texts, this course was marvelous. Joanna is an incredible instructor, empathetic and very knowledgeable, and the students enrolled in the course are contagious in their passion for Japanese history and culture. Even those with little or no background in Japanese lit will find Japan Lit 140 an excellent opportunity to read widely and be exposed to many critical authors in the last century of published protest fiction.</comment></course>E-PSCI 282r: New Views on the Tectonic Evolution of the Appalachians</title>This class is a lot of fun and an awesome opportunity to engage with a specific geological topic.</comment></course>FRSEMR 44t: The Atomic Bomb in History and Culture</title>Professor Mendelsohn is such an interesting teacher. You'll be reading about a person involved in the Manhattan Project, and Professor Mendelsohn will talk about how he knew that person and tell personal anecdotes about them. I loved this course. It expanded my understanding of the deadliest weapon humankind has ever created, and the moral questions that surround it. Also, I can't overstate how nice Professor Mendelsohn is. He invited the whole class to his house for dinner one night. Take this course!</comment>This is a very interesting seminar and Prof. Mendelsohn is absolutely fantastic. Though, be warned, although it is a freshman seminar, it gives a great deal of reading. Do not take this course as a means of balancing the rest of a very difficult schedule, as I attempted. Although it is absolutely possible to get by without doing much (if any) of the work, you will not really be getting as much from the class as you could otherwise.</comment>Only take it if you're very interested in the scientific side and the development of the bomb and prepared to do lots of reading.</comment>This class is great, although there is a lot of reading. If you are ok with not getting all the work done, but then not being able to engage in section as much, then it is a great course. Professor is awesome, and took us to a great dinner at his residence which was a high point of the semester.</comment>It's very interesting, but I would note that it is much more of a history course than one might otherwise expect. There isn't much theoretical, philosophical, or moral discussion, which isn't a bad thing, just something to keep in mind.</comment>There is plenty of opportunity to learn a lot, mostly through readings.</comment>This is a great class, and I highly recommend it to students interested in history and/or science. Professor Mendelsohn is a very skilled teacher and leads discussions masterfully. The only issue I had in my group was that a lot of people didn't do the readings - many people barely skimmed it. This really negatively impacted the discussions in class. Try to do all of the readings; they're really enjoyable and varied, spanning from sci-fi plays to the accounts of the scientists who built the atomic bomb. You'll likely see other responses that say you don't have to do the reading, but I regret  not reading everything in the class.</comment>A great course for anyone with a general enthusiasm for nuclear policy and weapons. It definitely goes more into the history rather than its effect on culture, but the discussions alone are definitely worth taking the class. Readings are long, but it's not necessary at all to engage in conversation so don't be turned off by them.</comment>This course is lead by a man who knew alot of the greats from atomic research. Take it. Learn from him, and from the readings. You will dive into an area of the world that will forever be relevant.</comment></course>PHYSICS 287a: Introduction to String Theory</title>Don't take this class at the same time with more than 1 other (I did this and it probably wasn't the best idea).</comment>good course in strings, but only take it if you need it because it's a lot of work</comment>This is not an easy course and Xi's teaching style doesn't help. Don't worry if you don't think "it's easy to see" something that he thinks "is easy to see", since you are not be alone.</comment>The class is challenging and requires sufficient effort to be useful. However, if you put in the time and keep with the class, it provides a very clear introduction to string theory.</comment></course>DRAMA 116: Acting Workshop: Comedy</title>This class was very fun and when you were not performing it was very laid back and you got to watch everyone else perform.</comment>Scott Zigler is brilliant and deeply respectful and a great director. Getting to work on a scene with him is wonderful. Especially when you ask for him to put in time outside of class (which you should do!!! it might seem like he’s not that invested, but he just has a lot of students to work with, and so won’t volunteer to go the extra mile unless you ask for it). Also, the more prepared you as a student come in (as per usual), the more you get out of your time working on a scene with him. Be warned, though, students spend most of the time watching other students be directed and frankly, it gets hard to continue to remain attentive after a while, even though the professor is doing excellent work. On top of that, when you do get to work with him, it feels like there is nowhere close to enough time to really play as much as you might like. Also, it was possible to completely check out and not be called out for it. I get that it isn't only the teacher's responsibility to make sure students are paying attention, but i also don't think an hour and 15 minutes of the class should go by without 3/4 of the class having to have been paying attention.</comment>Great comedy work - definitely more in-depth than I thought it would be.</comment>You get what out of this class what you put into it. And it is SO much fun.</comment>Ziggler is a genius. You learn, you write, you watch, you laugh - and every single day he amazes you with his insights. It's absurd. As many classes as you can take from him, take. You leave infinitely improved, no mater what your original level of skill. His attention not only to nuances of performance but to facilitating a more sophisticated and practical knowledge of comedy on stage is invaluable for anyone who is interested in pursuing the medium in any capacity.</comment>Be prepared to take initiative and look for your own material. This can be the hardest part of the course, but it is the most rewarding since it introduces you to so many plays.</comment>This course is supremely fun! If you're into comedy and have a spare class, it is a must-take. Scott is always available to you, even if you want to talk about a project unrelated to the class such as a play you're doing. The types of comedy covered are broad. Highly recommended. Scott is a fantastic teacher!</comment>It's a fun way to learn about the nuts and bolts of comedy acting, as well as get a taste of comedy writing.</comment>It's super helpful in learning how to mechanically create a comedic scene. It's also pretty laid-back and great when you work on your scene. Great class - awesome if you're interested in comedy, specifically in plays. We also got to write a sketch and get feedback, which was awesome.</comment>Great class.  Scott's really smart, and you will become a better all around actor by taking this course</comment>This class is so much fun! It's not too time intensive, except when it's your week to present your scene, but Scott is an amazing teacher. He clearly knows what he's talking about and sees every possible opportunity for a joke that there could be. No opportunity for comedy is left unturned!</comment></course>RELIGION 1080: Modern States and Religion</title>To truly benefit from the course make sure to keep up with all the readings. Moreover, make sure to take notes when Prof. Zeghal speaks because she has some truly interesting, productive, and thought-provoking insights.</comment>Take the class! Though I was the only undergraduate student in the class this semester, I learned a lot about Islam and Politics not only through the readings, but also through hearing the graduate students and Professor express what they already knew on the topic. Thus, though it was challenging, it was an invaluable learning experience. Also, go to office hours! You can discuss any questions you may have on the readings, and the Professor is really helpful.</comment></course>EXPOS 20.229: Slave Narratives</title>It's a good class, but I think it is slightly harder and more loaded than people previously told me.</comment>A great way to feel like you got something out of the expos requirement. Dr. Becker is a fantastic professor who truly cares about his students and will help you become a better writer</comment>Expos is probably not going to be your favorite class, but often this class doesn't feel like a required writing class. If you have any interest in the slave trade, you will love this class like I did. Beyond just the writing and research elements, I think topics from this course are very applicable to other studies. As far as expos goes, I can't imagine a more enjoyable and intriguing class!</comment>The class readings are really enjoyable because slave narratives use an ample amount of rhetorical devices, so you're never scrambling to find evidence for a particular idea. They are also very interesting and pertain to a lot of social issues that we still have in our society to this day.</comment>Interesting topic. Great preceptor. Take the class!</comment>This is as good as you'll get to fulfill your Expos requirement. Dr. Becker is great, the material is interesting, and you won't be punished with a crazy workload beyond the papers for the course.</comment>Expos is challenging, but Dr. Becker is great. The course is geared toward literary analysis so if you plan on going into the sciences it might not be a good fit.</comment>"Slave Narratives" expos was great! Dr. Becker is friendly, helpful, and a fair grader, though it's not always easy to understand what he's getting at. The books and films were analyzed were meaningful and engaging, and class discussions were always insightful, interesting, and surprising. I didn't realize coming in that it would be so literature/humanities-focused, so note that it's a lot of close readings and analysis of the texts as literature (for the way they're written) rather than as historical documents (for what they say). Wound up loving it anyways, but probably would have preferred an Expos more tailored to my academic interests. In any case, one of the better Expos courses!</comment>This is a great class to fulfill the expos requirement.  Dr. Becker is phenomenal and the work isn't that hard.  Your writing will definitely improve.</comment>The topic, Slave Narratives, is almost an afterthought. The class focuses on writing, and the topic becomes a useful background. The class is hard through, and I felt like I put in all the hours but got nothing to show for it.</comment>While challenging, Slave Narratives is an Expos course that is both interesting and rewarding as you will take away much from the readings and discussions.  With a moderate workload and broad range of readings and material, this class is an enjoyable way to fulfill the Expos requirement.</comment></course>PHYSICS 143a: Quantum Mechanics I</title>Of course you have to take this course as a physics concentrator, but the physics is really cool! Your enjoyment in it really seems to come from how much you can understand and connect with the material. The class itself is very standard. The lectures and textbook go through the material, and section reviews it. Although I found lectures very dry (but effective), the sections were awesome! Dominik (TF) is very good at reinforcing topics, and I feel like his sections were highly underutilized.</comment>It's quantum. You can't not take quantum (assuming you're a physicist) so you're kinda stuck with it. Just hope that the professor is better next year.</comment>This is a good introduction to quantum mechanics. Most of it is just linear algebra; not that you'll have to study up, but familiarity is probably helpful! Matthew Reece is a concise lecturer; he's very nice.</comment>This class is super interesting! Prof.Reece has such a wonderful personality and is really willing to chat/help. Townsend does a great job setting up the linear algebra background prep for the less comfortable students. This class is completely doable with a reasonable schedule, but you do need to put in a considerable amount of time.  Special advice for ChemPhys/CPB concentrators who are looking into Chem40 and this class: I actually recommend taking this class before Chem40. All the qualitative analysis of MO theory in Chem40 will make a ton more sense after this class.</comment>Take 151 either before or concurrently. If you are a physics major, you have no excuse playing around with the Hamiltonian as an operator and not knowing where it comes from. (Understanding canonical transformations also helps with some conceptual stuff later on in the course).</comment>This course, as taught by Prof. Reece, was truly excellent - far better than it was with any previous professor in recent memory, judging from the experiences of most of the physics concentrators with whom I've spoken. Lectures were truly wonderful; Prof. Reece's explanations and the order in which he presented content was extremely comprehensible and comprehensive. Problem sets were very well crafted: an excellent balance between challenging and reasonable in length and time required. And, finally, Prof. Reece's decision to forego chapter 11 (perturbation theory) in favor of a discussion of more conceptually interesting topics like the Bell inequalities, entanglement, teleportation, etc, was really excellent; he really cared that we come away with some knowledge of not just the mathematical framework, but of some of the larger-reaching implications of quantum mechanics and some basic understanding of why it will be important technologically in years to come. 
However, the physics department seems, inexplicably, irrationally, and, frankly, stupidly, to have a new person teach this course each semester, so I doubt that Prof. Reece will teach this again anytime soon. If you're lucky enough to have a chance to take it with him -- do so! If not, though, my above comments will likely have no bearing on your experience, as the quality and characteristics of the course vary wildly between professors.</comment>This class is an organized introduction to the tools you'll need to study quantum mechanics, and builds a pretty solid foundation. It was a lot more centered on algebra and operators for the most part than on their physical implications, however. It might be useful and inspiring every now and then to explore for yourself how the starting points that class offers fit in with cool, counterintuitive quantum stuff - looking at the later chapters in Townsend by yourself (that we didn't get to in class), like the ones on electromagnetic fields, if you find the time, could be a way of doing this.</comment>Quantum mechanics is a fascinating topic, and Professor Reece taught it quite well. The class was engaging but at the same time rigorous. It was challenging, but not overwhelming.  Don't get too worried about the 15 a/c prerequisite; Very little material from these classes is actually invoked. By far more important is linear algebra. Would absolutely recommend to anybody interested in physics and math!</comment>Quantum mechanics is a really cool subject! Professor Reece was a pretty clear lecturer, problem sets and exams were pretty fair, and the book was easy to understand. It's hard to grapple with the concepts though - they're certainly not intuitive. Leave time to let quantum sink into your brain.</comment>Solid and very mathematical foundation in QM.</comment>143a is the likely the first time you'll be doing actually *new* physics during your undergraduate career. Enjoy it - there's a fair bit of algebraic obnoxiousness involved, but it's still pretty cool stuff.</comment>If you're a physics concentrator, then you have to take this class. It's not too difficult, but can be a little dry sometimes as it is an introduction course. Reece is very clear (though can be a little dry when lecturing), and a great guy. Pretty painless, and not bad!</comment>Quantum Mechanics is amazing. I believe that anyone interested in science should at least take one semester of quantum mechanics to just be amazed by it. This semester was at a particularly good pace - not too fast, not crazily difficult - so it was a wonderful semester for me to have taken this class as an elective.</comment>For those who are Chem/Phys and hesitating between a physics quantum or chem quantum, I would highly recommend this course. While challenging, it is entirely manageable and rewarding. You will learn quantum in a rigorous and logical manner. Great course.</comment>It's hard to evaluate a course which changes from year to year. Quantum is a pretty necessary class, and it knows it. I found that Reece's lectures were excellent in the beginning, but got too technical (to make the math clear), s.t. it took a great deal of effort and outside help to give meaning to what we were doing. I would highly recommend supplementing this course with readings from Griffiths quantum.</comment>Quantum is very interesting material, and Professor Reece does a great job teaching it!</comment></course>PSY 2553r: Behavioral Insights Group Research Seminar</title>This is a lab course and Gino's lab is quite a big lab, so actually I never met or worked with Professor. Gino herself. But I really enjoy working with the graduate student I am assigned too this semester. This could be a good fifth class as it is a good way to learn about psychology research without much heavy workload. Though the lab hours are a big time commitment if you don't plan carefully.</comment>Great if you are interested in business / consumer decision-making, and need a class with flexible hours without too much time commitment. Very loosely-structured, and your experience largely depends on the lab mentor or project you get assigned to.</comment>Not hard, but definitely a significant time commitment.</comment>In this course I worked as a position in a lab. The only assignments I had outside of it were some data-entry and paper-editing tasks.</comment>A positive attitude to learn from the doctoral students at HBS is needed. The projects are all unique and enjoyable!</comment>This "class" gives you real-life experience with running research, but what you get to do completely depends on the grad student you are assigned to. Some students get to do more, some students get to do less. I was able to assist in running a pretty cool study, but my interests weren't really matched. You also only get to interact with Professor Gino about once. An easy class, but those looking to learn more from a lab might want to look somewhere else.</comment>I would recommend this class to anyone that is interested in gaining insight into research considering the interaction between economics and psychology.</comment></course>GOV 2005: Formal Political Theory I</title>If you want to learn formal modeling and its application in political science, this is the place to start.</comment>This course was a good, no-frills introduction to game theory.</comment>This class was a mess. Two two-hour classes (a lecture and a section) were a less than ideal format for the material. Having an 8-10 AM section on Thursdays was awful, especially since it was only at that time because they apparently didn't want to bother with a second section, so they had to go outside the regular class hours to get a time for "everyone" (although sections were frequently under half-full as a result of the early start). There was only one regularly scheduled hour of office hours a week, despite the difficulty of the material. The teacher and TF created an environment where I didn't feel comfortable asking for help or clarifications in class; we would regularly get comments like "Well, you *should* know this already, but okay...". Didn't do handouts for things like large project, leading to vague and confusing instructions for a large percentage of the grade (plus confusion on deadlines; some weren't assigned until they just decided to have it due it the next week). Left last year's iSite up, complete with problem set answers, creating a huge disadvantage for those of us who chose not to use them, as the class was more or less graded competitively (also, from what I heard, they reused every pset and answer key from last year exactly, word for word, or pretty close). Assigned a problem set due the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, while not planning on being available to help in between its assignment and due date. Forgot to send out midsemester class evaluations for feedback, and didn't realize it until the last lecture. To make up for it, they had us give face-to-face feedback as a group, and argued with each criticism they were given. Most undergrads were taking the class reluctantly to begin with, and were unsatisfied with the end result. I would definitely advise not taking this as long as Horacio is still teaching it.</comment>Both the Professor and the TF are really charismatic and engaging. They definitely make it easier to understand the material.</comment>Be ready to work a lot and make sure you review calculus before you take it.</comment>This is a difficult class, but you'll really learn a new way of thinking from working through it.</comment></course>ANE 212: Archaeology of the Levant</title>This class is indispensable for anyone interested in the anthropology, archaeology, or religion of the ancient Near East.</comment></course>ARABIC 241ar: Advanced Modern Arabic Bridge: Language, Literature, and Culture I</title>For many students, this course is a significant increase in workload. After a month or so, however, the students in the class as a whole adapted. Some of the readings are quite challenging (and not just from a linguistic sense), but at the end of the semester one should be able to pick up just about any research paper in Arabic and understand the main ideas at the minimum.</comment>Excellent and enthusiastic professor, with a unique range and quality of readings.</comment>This is a great class. Definitely take it if you are interested in continuing with Arabic. There are a lot of really good political and cultural arguments and authors discussed, but be aware that there is not nearly as much language instruction as in previous years (basically none) and there is very little literature in the syllabus currently.</comment>This is your only option for a 4th-year class of MSA. If you're not already fluent or if you didn't grow up in the Middle East (as some "students" in the class did), then it will be rough, especially at the beginning. Each class you'll have about 10 pages of reading in Arabic, and you won't be able to understand most of it. You'll have to make a blog post on it at least 24 hours before class.... every class. It's a lot. And honestly, I'm not sure I improved much this semester, but at least I didn't get worse.</comment></course>AESTH&INTP 59: Nazi Cinema: The Art and Politics of Illusion</title>This class has a fair amount of work and can seem intimidating if you are not a Film buff, but have no fear, the material is fairly easy to understand and the instructors are happy to help introduce you to the analysis of film.</comment>It's a great class, but definitely not a gut.</comment>This class has a decent workload, but if you budget your time effectively and participate actively in the class it is extremely rewarding.</comment>Professor Rentschler is so well-versed in the subject matter - he transmits knowledge and interpretation of film in a way that grabs everyone's attention. (Tarantino, FYI, went to him for a suggestion for Inglorious Basterds). The visual material of the course is highly engaging. The section TFs were very well chosen and know what they are talking about. This is a course that is essential in really no longer seeing the Nazis as extreme aliens, but as people, like us, who fell under mass culture and societal influences. The course answers the question "What do they have to do with us?", but not so thoroughly the question "What went wrong with them?"</comment>This was the coolest most relevant class I have taken at Harvard. I was constantly thinking about it and have learned so much about Nazi media culture and our own media culture. It really opens your eyes to your environment and makes you question the strategies of modern day advertising. Professor Rentschler is an unbelievable lecturer and I never wanted to miss class. Take this if are interested in media and its relevance to our culture and nazi!</comment>This course has WAY too much assigned work for a gen ed. It's just absurd how many essays and books you are expected to read and be able to refer to on exams. Plus, it's a huge class time commitment with 2, 1 hour lectures each week, a 1 hour section, and a ~2 hour film screening. Plus it has two 8pg. essays, a quiz, midterm, and final. On the course material itself - the course teaches absolutely no historical information whatsoever, yet the first quiz was entirely on who did what, when, and what was this policy during WWII - no one did well on that one. It is very much a propaganda course, and some of the films really are interesting, although lectures are incredibly boring. Professor Rentschler is remarkably good at using a lot of words to not say anything.</comment>Take this class if you want to become more savvy when it comes to the images constructed by the mass media. A lot is to be learned about our own culture from studying the visual culture of the National Socialist Party and that is one of the most interesting (and frightening) aspects of the course.</comment>A good course, with good material and good ideas. But, for a very "Gen Ed" course... it's a decent amount of work assigned. Just be comfortable not doing a lot of it from day one, unless you really want to make this a serious course for yourself (which isn't a bad idea--I didn't, but the course has very serious ideas in it).</comment>Is ok.</comment>This class is not very hard but requires a lot of thought and interest in the subject.</comment>This class is as interesting as it sounds - take it!!  Themes are relevant to contemporary life.</comment>Do not hesitate to take this course, even if you've already satisfied the gen-ed requirement. It may not be the easiest way to fill a requirement: it requires deep and critical thought and reflection. But it will give you a new perspective in everything you do, and I would go so far as to say that it, in many ways, changes the very way you view the world and your place in it.</comment>Rentschler is an absolute legend. I think you will be hard pressed to find anyone who 1) knows this material better and 2) cares more about it. He is so well read, and it really comes through in lecture. If you're looking for an awesome Gen Ed, this is absolutely the right class to take. There's probably a little bit more workload than the average gen ed, but it is totally worth it since this is so interesting. Definitely will remember taking this class forever.</comment>This is an incredibly interesting class. Even if you only have marginal interest in the subject matter, you will definitely learn something. Beware, this class is not that hard but can be deceptively more work than it seems.</comment>It's a bit more work than most gen eds, but it's worth it</comment>Eric Rentschler is hands-down the best lecturer I've had in the past 3.5 years at Harvard! His lectures are the only ones where I've been able to pay attention for the entire time. Take this class because not only will it give you important insights into a dark time in human history but also force you to think about how mass culture in Nazi Germany was similar to pop culture today. The films we're assigned to watch are for the most part very enjoyable and interesting to discuss- only a few are outright, sometimes offensive propaganda and others are very subtle.

A background in film analysis terminology definitely helps but is not an absolute prerequisite. My TF, Caufield, leads really interesting discussion sections but I felt that he graded my essays more based on the style than on the content. The class is not an easy A, but you will learn so much from it!</comment>AI 59 is no slouch Gen Ed - don't take it if you're looking for an easy way to fulfill a requirement. However, the hard work (yes, there's a lot of reading, writing, and viewing) put into AI 59 is extremely rewarding. I'm no longer the same person I was at the beginning of the semester. I am far smarter, far more educated about something as superficial as Nazi cinema as a history lesson and as deep as today's media as a life lesson. Do yourself a favor and take this course because it will change how you view audiovisual media and pop culture - it's an important Gen Ed because of how much growth it fosters. Plus, we finish off the semester by watching Inglorious Basterds. 'Nuff said.</comment>Really interesting class that tells you a whole lot. The essays are hard, but you will after this class have a better appreciation for the powers of media.</comment>The information is very interesting and provides a good insight into something that we generally don't study. The sections are particularly great. It might be a good idea to learn some of the basics about writing about film beforehand</comment>If you like movies, you'll like this class.</comment>This is a wonderful course that will change your perception of media. (You may very well find yourself having some disturbing revelations about the way our society engages with the media). Keep in mind--this is not an easy, light-work gen ed, but it is well worth the time if you are remotely interested in film, German culture, the Nazis, or modern media.</comment>Be prepared to watch film screenings and read essays, and then apply them to papers, blogs and frequent discussions in your weekly sections.</comment>This class isn't as easy as it may appear. However, it is extremely interesting and worthwhile, and if considering taking this class you should be prepared for a fair amount of work.</comment>A lot of readings -- but it's an exceedingly interesting subject. Rentschler is a genius and you will quote him in your essays.</comment>This class requires a lot of time outside class. Lectures are kind of hard to follow and sometimes a waste of time, and you have to watch at least one movie a week (if not more) which is actually a lot of time to sit down and analyze a movie. Only two papers, so it doesn't seem like much work, but it is. The movies are interesting.</comment>This has got to be among the best two classes I have taken at Harvard. I have taken many fun or enriching classes, but this one takes the prize on multiple levels. The class was fun and engaging because of the movies, because Professor Rentschler is an awesome lecturer (I want to lecture like him), and because my TF, Katie, was the coolest yet TF yet she was also concerned with the material and willing to provide ridiculous amounts of feedback. I really appreciated how much content there was. Furthermore, I left this class with my eyes much more open. We all know there is propaganda out there, but this class really will widely expand your horizons if you take it. I only took it because it had politics and because I needed an A&I class, but I am very glad that I took it. In short, I loved it, and it is very relevant in our society today.</comment>There is a lot of reading, but it's worth it</comment>It's a fascinating class that will improve your understanding of our society but there is a lot of reading involved, which can be time-consuming if you have many psets or other homework to do at the same time.</comment>I loved this class, this was by far one of my favorite classes I've taken at Harvard.  The multimedia course material kept things interesting and Rentschler is a fantastic and engaging lecturer.</comment>Be sure to watch the movies before coming to section.</comment>I would tell them it is a lot of work and a difficult course, but if they are interested in German culture, history, and film, the hours of work are worth it. It is a phenomenally taught course by Professor Eric Rentschler, the lectures are fascinating, and all of the TF's love the material and helping their students.</comment>This is a great class to take if you are interested in media and/or the Nazi era.  The class doesn't require too much work outside of the class, just weekly readings and two papers, but having two one-hour lectures and a film screening or two every week can be a time commitment, especially when the films aren't available on the internet to watch at your leisure.</comment>This course is- hands down- one of the coolest experiences that Harvard has to offer. From stunning Nazi films to altered pop-perspectives today, this class is utterly brilliant. You'll be missing something by not taking this course.</comment>This class is is incredibly interesting, but is more work than some gen eds.  The movie each week is about 2 hours out of class, and there are 2 papers, 1 quiz, midterm, and final.</comment>The lectures are incredible.</comment>Great class! I had been told by past students that this course is more work than usual for a Gen Ed, and they were correct, but it's honestly pretty rewarding work. The material is interesting, and even though the lectures aren't particularly helpful, discussion in section was super engaging.</comment>There is little to no effort made to teach about formal film characteristics but students are still expected to constantly analyze film. The class needs a section about this, or students need to have background.</comment>This class satisfied a ton of my desires; a history class, a film class, and a section based class. Rick might not be the most enjoyable lecturer in the world, but the subject material is so interesting that you should probably still take this course.</comment>Take it! its very intresting and not too hard. I learned about history, film and propaganda.</comment>Don't be afraid of embracing the abstract and theoretical. If you are more of a factual person, this course might me a little bit more challenging for you.</comment>Make sure to make all film viewings</comment>This is an incredible class, an awesome A&IU if you're at all interested in film, propaganda or Nazi/WWII history. Rentschler is an incredible lecturer; he's clearly enamored with the subject and it shows. Going to screenings will hugely increase your enjoyment of the lectures and sections.</comment>If you are at all interested in World War II or film, take this course. It is absurdly interesting and the lectures are very captivating, but it's not particularly easy, so don't take it unless you are willing to put in some concentration-level effort. If you do, I can assure that you will get a lot out of this class.</comment>This class is an interesting approach to Nazi Germany--it melds history with culture in a unique and engaging manner. Students should be prepared to spend a lot of time reading and watching film screenings outside of class, but, if one is interested in the material, this class is very enriching.</comment>Make sure you get a good TF, makes all the difference.</comment>The class introduces you to some really interesting films that you probably won't see otherwise. However, the readings and lectures can sometimes be extremely dry. If you're interested in taking it just as a film class, there are probably better ones.</comment>I would say that this course is more work than the average gen ed (weekly blogpost, film screening, 2 papers, 2 exams) but it is definitely worth it. It is by far my favorite class I have taken at Harvard so far. Rentschler is a phenomenal lecturer and the films are very entertaining. I would just say go over the films with a friend before the exams and you will be fine</comment>Honestly, take this class - it was so amazing!</comment>I think the class teaches you about more than just Nazi cinema: I think it also teaches you about the role of Nazis and propaganda in our own society. So I think it's a pretty valuable class, especially if you're looking for a subject you wouldn't normally study. However, if you're going to take it, I think you should also make sure you really know how to write and know at least something about film. Because I'm not that great a writer, and I went into the class knowing nothing about film, and I felt like a fish out of water. I didn't do too badly in the class, but I think you definitely have a better experience and get more out of it if you know how to write and know something about film.</comment>Watching the films is really enjoyable, but the readings can get dense. Don't take the class if you're looking for an easy A, but if you're interested in the film theory and history then it's really great.</comment>Take this class!</comment>It's more work than you expect! A lot of in- and out-of- class time required.</comment></course>ENGLISH 256n: Theory and Practice of the Victorian Novel: Graduate Seminar</title>This course consciously offers a comprehensive introduction to the Victorian novel and its development, as well as many of the reactions and theoretical debates which surround the literature. It unconsciously models a teaching paradigm that combines deeply considered structure with adaptability. Take this course and you will learn far more than you realize--which is saying something.</comment>This class is the closest thing you can find to living in Victorian England. And that is a good thing. Professor Price is ideal in so many ways -- encyclopedic, charming, provocative, and more. The discussions in this seminar were the best out of any class I took this semester. Importantly, we talk just as frequently about the Victorian novel as we do about our profession, ways of reading, literary history, and where we fit in the grand scheme of things. The reading list is well chosen (and optimal for Generals coverage), the emphasis on Victorian and contemporary criticism engaging and challenging, the written assignments perfectly suited to professional development. A gem -- take it.</comment>This is a wonderful class! Definitely worth taking, for anyone with even a remote interest in the Victorian novel. Professor Price clearly loves her subject and loves teaching it to students; her enthusiasm makes the class really a joy to take.</comment>This is a fun and extremely enlightening survey of Victorian novels. As long as you haven't read everything on the syllabus already (and maybe even if you have) you should take this course.</comment>There is a lot of reading, so it helps if you have already read the primary texts. We tended to discuss the criticism more than the primary texts though.</comment>This is one of the better classes I have ever taken.</comment></course>HIST 1015: From Ghana to Guantanamo: European and American Empires in the Long Nineteenth Century</title>This course will teach you what it originally meant to be an American. It also contextualizes current events in a way that reveals international conflict.</comment>Excellent class! Great way to begin studying imperial history. Reading load was light and assignments were very manageable. Also Professor Press is a gem. He somehow manages to make classes on colonialism humorous in a way that is not offensive, so lectures are fun and engaging.</comment>This is a great survey class that covers some not so common periods of imperialism, e.g. the filibusters of the 19th century. Although focused on the 19th century, the last weeks look forward to the modern day, helping to contextualize the importance of studying that period. The response papers and mid-term are straight forward, and you have complete free reign to write about whatever you like. Professor Press is wonderful, deeply knowledgeable with a dry, sharp sense of humour that makes class really enjoyable, and very very supportive. If you have any interest in imperial history, take this class!</comment>Press is a great teacher and this class is both interesting and not too hard. There aren't a lot of classes like that. The subject is pretty neat--Press knows his stuff and covers a wide variety. A must take.</comment>One of my favorite classes thus far! Steven is a great lecturer, really excited about the course material, accessible, and a nice guy. It was a terrific introduction to colonial and global history.</comment>This class is a really interesting different look at imperialism from something like Ferguson's Western Ascendancy.  Press is a great lecturer, really open to questions and really cares about his students.  He is also really flexible and tries to be genuinely helpful and accessible. Also, this could easily be a first history course at Harvard.  The readings were a little weird and the lack of a geographic focus made things kind of disjointed.</comment>He is an unbelievable professor.  Absolutely brilliant and interesting to listen to and talk to after class.</comment>This is one of the best courses at Harvard. If you are interested in imperial history, I highly recommend this course and the professor. Dr. Press is very bright, talented, and available and makes class always fun. The course covers a broad expanse of the globe in its examination of modes of nineteenth century imperialism.</comment>This course was pretty interesting, but maybe not my favorite course ever. It was helpful in my framing of imperial history as a series of major themes, situated in moments of time. Professor Press is very smart, and also has a ridiculously weird but fun sense of humor that made the class enjoyable for me. His lectures were mostly interesting I thought, especially those that pertained to my area of interest (I took this course for a Social Studies focus field requirement). The class is also small, too, so section discussion is great. Don't take it if you don't have a background/interest in world/imperial history.</comment></course>E-PSCI 208: Physics of Climate</title>This class is not hard at all, and Zhiming does a good job covering all the material in a pretty clear way.</comment>If you have an interest in atmospheric science and/or climate modeling, and you are comfortable with a very mathematically-based approach, take this course! You get to see a lot of very interesting topics over a broad range. The course staff is very relaxed but engaged with the material, and you also get to learn directly from someone making strides in the field. Not having a basic background in atmospheric science can be disheartening at times but the p-sets will help you come out with a good understanding. The TF was also very helpful! The midterm and final assignments were a great way to get into the depth of a couple topics and really see the forefront of atmospheric/climate research. The class in general is pretty light on workload since problem sets are spaced to every two weeks.</comment>This is a really helpful course, helping you build up a complementary understanding of atmospheric and oceanic science.</comment>Does a good job - mainly because of Prof. Kuang being a very solid lecturer and responsive to questions - of covering the broadest generalities of ocean and atmosphere circulation, without delving into the particular phenomena much. Focus on the mathematical tools for investigating these phenomena demands that the student have a strong footing in real analysis.</comment></course>PSY 2450: Affective and Social Neuroscience</title>Please take this class. It is intense and you will be forced to actually think about what you are saying, apply material, and be on top of the readings and assignments. If you have never experienced that in a classroom, it is really cool and promotes learning and application very effectively.</comment></course>HAA 270y: From the Philosophy Chamber : Harvard and the Arts in the Early Republic</title>I don't know if this course will be offered again, but it was excellent. Being able to work on a specific exhibition is a rewarding and challenging experience. Profs. Roberts and Lasser are both fantastic seminar leaders as well as art historians. Highly recommended.</comment></course>HAA 279k: William Kentridge</title>This could be a life-changing course.</comment></course>WOMGEN 1221: La Chicana: Race, Gender, and Mexican-American Identity</title>The material in this course is incredible. To me, thinking about Chicana feminisms means thinking about how race, gender, ethnicity, culture, citizenship, and language all interact with one another. It means thinking actively about all the ways of belonging we use to navigate the world, and it becomes so clear here how impossible and foolish it is to segment them. A lot of the readings are theoretical, and I sometimes would read them out loud to friends just to have a laugh at how strange WGS courses can get. But ultimately, I take them really seriously, and I loved moving through the material here. It certainly bled into all of my other classes, and I think it's going to stick with me for a long time.</comment>Be prepared to read, a lot. The professor will call you out, even if you try to avoid eye contact.</comment>I think the class was challenging at times but it was truly one of the best classes I've taken. It helped me enhance my critical thinking skills and my writing a great deal. Also, Professor Grigsby is very passionate about the material and is very knowledgable about it, which helps when dissecting topics and theories. She is also very creative in teaching us the material and allows discussion to be a tool for our learning</comment>I learned a lot from this class. It is definitely a lot of work, but it was worth it. I recommend taking it, but not if you're looking for an easy fifth class or not intending to do all the readings. If you put in the work and are interested in social justice, race, ethnicity, feminism, and/or Chicanx/Latinx history and studies, then definitely check out this course.</comment>While there is a significant amount of work in terms of reading and papers, this is oneof the most interesting, engaging classes I've had here. The content is great, the discussions are engaging, and Professor Grigsby is a great professor, who is very helpful and available to help. Her expectations are high, but I always felt supported and driven to meet them.</comment></course>FRENCH 189: "Re: History" Memory and Imagination from Camus to Annie Ernaux</title>Professor Bouju is one of the best Professors you will ever encounter. His priorities are the students' growth and improvement and to provide a broad understanding of the topic. He is understanding and also very demanding, and you will come away from the course having read an incredible list of books, with knowledge of a wide array of authors, as well as an entire era of history, and with a whole new level of ability as a writer.</comment>If you should have the luck to take this class, you will engage with some great books and some really interesting ideas/concepts. You will also learn a lot about the french vs. american university system from Prof. Bouju, who is one of the great rare teachers who really, above all, wants his students to learn.</comment>The readings are thought-provoking and carefully chosen; it's a great overview of many crucial authors and works centered coherently around the theme of memory. Bouju is a meticulous, but extremely fair, grader.</comment>The readings are dense, but really interesting. Bouju is an excellent professor and has extensive knowledge about the texts and contexts. I would definitely take another course he teaches.</comment></course>ENGLISH Cijr: Introduction to Journalism</title>Take this class!! Professor Abramson is probably the best teacher I've had at Harvard. The class is fun, engaging, and will make you a better writer.</comment>Fantastic, valuable, enjoyable class. I genuinely looked forward to Monday afternoons each week. Professor Abramson brought incredible insight from a remarkable career and was a lot of fun. She was also incredibly generous with her time outside of class, meeting throughout the semester to discuss both assignments and career and life advice. Readings were engaging and very manageable.   I wouldn't be intimidated to apply for the class without much journalism experience; it could definitely serve as an introduction to the topic.</comment>Where to start? Jill Abramson is THE person to learn journalism from. She brought incredible stories, excellent guests, and a deep interest in her students. The top editor there is knows a lot about developing writers and you're sure to emerge from this class a much stronger writer.</comment>This is a fabulous course. The chance to read the pieces Jill Abramson considers to be the best in all of journalism is itself worth it, and in addition she leads a great seminar and is warm and accessible to her students. If you're fortunate enough to get into this course, take it!</comment>Jill Abramson knows everything there is to know about journalism. Whether you want to be a journalist or just tell stories, this class is 100% the best way to read a lot, learn a lot, and also listen to a lot of kickass super dope journalists tell you about the biz. Seriously. TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU CAN.</comment>This is a wonderful class for anyone interested in journalism. Professor Abramson is endlessly knowledgeable, and it is an amazing opportunity to be able to learn from her.</comment>You may have read all these pieces about Jill Abramson earlier in the year that portrayed her as a tough, pushy, stern boss. Forget that smug characterization. Professor Abramson was one of the most dedicated and delightful professor I have ever had. She picks engaging readings, holds frequent office hours where you would always want to go, even if just to 'hang out.' She tries to know students on an individual, personal level and also provides great advice about anyone interested in a career (or internship) in the field of journalism.</comment></course>LITER 138: Subversive Renaissance: Books that Changed the World</title>If you want an intro to the Renaissance, or to explore any work furthur, take this class! You will read the Renaissance Greats, Petrarch, Boccacio, Ghelli, Cervantes, as well as writers you may not have heard of like the Persian poetess Jahan. Professor Piechocki is a brilliant presenter, and knows the Renaissance well. She uses art and other sources to make brilliant presentations each week, and gives good historical background to each figure.</comment>This was a well-structured class that helped me both learn about the Renaissance and change my previous assumptions about it. In Piechocki you will find a very kind, caring, and energetic professor.</comment>The only reason I wouldn't want to recommend with enthusiasm might be because I'd like to preserve the small class size (a large part why I found this course so valuable). I'd say: if just a couple readings on the syllabus interest you, you are likely to enjoy the others as well, because the class encourages discussion of larger themes present in all readings.</comment></course>HISTSCI 285: Science, Power and Politics</title>This is a rigorous course that will make you believe in the intellectual power of the social sciences. It does precisely what Sheila promises at the beginning: to do for science what occured for religion with the "enlightenment" turn in Western thought. this will stretch your thinking in ways that far exceed any philosophy or mathematics class I've taken at Harvard--though Goldfarb's Godel class comes close.</comment>The workload is a little heavy. But if you do the readings carefully, you can surely get a lot out of the course.</comment>This is a phenomenal, well-crafted course. It is an absolute must-take for anyone interested in STS, and a great complement to history of science coursework (courses in history of science will likely cover some of these concepts/readings, but even the way a given reading is read will differ—definitely in complementary ways). Do yourself a favor and take the course, but plan your semester knowing that it will take a substantial amount of work. If you do, and put the time into it, the course will be invaluable. Professor Jasanoff has incredible knowledge of the field and pushes all students to think in new ways. Even if you are already familiar with STS, taking this course will deepen your knowledge and grasp of the material.</comment>I could not recommend this course more highly, though it will be a substantial investment of your time and mental faculties for the semester. What will not take much effort, however, is to see the world around you through the lens of the frameworks and lessons from STS you will get through this course. STS is intellectually fulfilling in that it examines what other disciplines would take for granted, but it is also incredibly relevant and applicable to today's world where science and technology have increasingly complex relationships to every other facet of our lives. I will say this course was probably particularly difficult for me in that I was a complete newbie to social theories, so the initial learning curve was steep, so for me, it was like being dropped into the middle of a desert where I didn't speak the local language. Fortunately, the local people (my classmates) were to be very friendly and welcoming--the type of people who want to study STS and that the professor attracts to the course tend to be so--and my guide (Prof. Jasanoff) was extremely generous with her time and ideas to help me understand as we went along.</comment>This was my favorite class that I've taken since coming to Harvard. It draws together analytical approaches from numerous fields to touch upon very important issues in modern society. The class is also incredibly time consuming, which can make it difficult to fit into your schedule. (This point is especially relevant for graduate students in the natural sciences, where coursework is generally discouraged regardless of the work load it entails.) That being said, for students interested in STS or related topics, the class is fully worth it.</comment></course>CULTR&BLF 48: God, Justice, and the Book of Job</title>The course is difficult, and the teacher expects the most out of his students. However, the information learned is valuable to the way you live your life. I'd recommend this course.</comment>AMAZING COURSE. Its too bad Prof Machinist is retiring. He is extremely conversant in the subject matter and allows as much discussion as possible. This course explores some of the biggest questions regarding evil, divine justice, existentialism, God, etc. It has the potential to transform one's mindset. Nothing deals with those questions as the book of Job. I highly recommend this course.</comment></course>GOV 1780: International Political Economy</title>Great course. Very doable workload, Professor Frieden is great. Papers are annoying and just require you to spew information.</comment>If you want a broad understanding of the mechanics and politics of trade, development, debt crises, and other international economic topics, this course is perfect.</comment>Not as difficult as some people make it out to be. The lectures are great and the material is very interesting. Prof. Frieden is also super friendly and approachable and obviously cares a lot about teaching. Essays and exams are pretty straightforward as log as you pay attention in class and answer the prompts. The readings in the Frieden, Lake, and Broz book could get kind of dense, but it easy to get by just skimming those.</comment>This is one of the most valuable classes you may take in understanding how economics really works when politics is factored in. You learn about why and how the global economy has progressed to the way it is today, and that is a perfect tool for exploring its future.  The class doesn't ask much of you. Readings can be heavy, but the assignments are few, though require thought. Definitely don't sweat the small stuff; major concepts are the things you really want to care about.</comment>Contrary to what peers told me and what past Q guides suggested, this course his hardly impossible. Perhaps it demands slightly more work than other gov courses, but I found the expectations to be perfectly reasonable. More importantly, this class is extremely informative. Unless you are already exceedingly well-versed in economics, this course will make you a more informed human being. Suddenly, economic news will begin to make sense. Professor Frieden is a good lecturer and cares about getting to know students. Ranjit was a very good section leader.</comment>Graded fairly but pretty tough. If you are not familiar with economic concepts there is a bit of a learning curve, but it is still super interesting. I feel smarter after taking the course.</comment>It can be a lot to keep up with and the grading is pretty difficult by Harvard standards. That being said, the material was really interesting and Frieden is a great lecturer. The topics in this class are important to understand for pretty much everyone, and reading the news is a lot more engaging because I now have the requisite background information to understand how politicians make decisions about monetary policy. I took this as an elective and it was certainly not an easy A class, but I would definitely recommend it. If Ranjit is still a TF make sure you get him, he does a great job summarizing concepts in section.</comment>This class is a good introduction to the topic. The readings are diverse and interesting, and I feel like I have a solid understanding of IPE coming out of this course.</comment>This course is a great introduction to IPE. You cover a lot of material and if you engage with it, you'll learn a great deal by the end of the course. Prof. Frieden is an incredible professor; his lectures are amazing and he is the most approachable professor I've had at Harvard. I loved the class and would recommend it to everyone.</comment>This course is a great survey into the study of International Political Economy. Professor Frieden literally wrote the book on IPE and he is so enthusiastic about the subject that it's impossible not to be enthusiastic too. He is also funny and really nice! 

Lectures are interesting, if a little repetitive of the readings  and cursory, if you already know a lot of world history and economics, then they can be a bit boring. 

The teaching staff is excellent. My TF was amazing! He was super funny and dedicated and I learned a lot from him!</comment></course>MOD-HEB 120a: Intermediate Modern Hebrew I</title>You will never have a better teacher than Irit.</comment>Irit is an incredible instructor and person. That we can talk about world news on a weekly basis in a meaningful way and in Hebrew is a testament to how good her teaching is.</comment>This is by far the best language course I have taken at Harvard (and I have sat in four separate language instruction courses). Dr. Aharoni is not just an inspirational instructor - one who is patient, kind, loving, and generous with her time -, but she is also like a mother for all her students. She is sincerely interested in every student's development, linguistically and personally! Moreover, this class has been inspirational for me insofar as I can now see how another Semitic language is taught and, thereby, better improve my understanding of how to instruct Arabic myself. Lastly, I believe that Dr. Aharoni's class is the perfect experimental chamber for debating ideas about how to improve the world around us, especially regarding the situation in the Middle East (of which most students in this class are aware/with which they are personally concerned). Dr. Aharoni facilitates dialogue, which is at least a beginning.</comment>Irit is a really great teacher, and you'll learn more in this semester than in the entirety of the first year--you'll go from being able to speak a tiny bit to really having an extensive ability to create sentences.</comment></course>BIOSTAT 232: Methods I</title>The course material was useful, so I would recommend the course from this perspective. However, the instructor was very intimidating and I would suggest students take the course with another professor.</comment>Will teach you about the intuition and underlying philosophy of statistical methodology that often gets glossed over.</comment>This course is very useful to understand linear and logistic regression. The course is time demanding, but you will learn a lot of useful statistical tools.</comment>This class is a great higher-level introduction to regression models. However, it would be a miserable experience if you did not have a strong grasp on linear algebra and calculus.</comment>Optional readings were beneficial.</comment>Work hard at the beginning and the end will be easy.</comment>Download rmarkdown, and type up the assignments as you complete them in R--that will save time.</comment></course>ARABIC Ba: Intermediate Arabic I</title>This class is a good stepping stone for continuing Arabic improvement. A bit too grammar heavy for my taste. Tests were very difficult. I would like to see more focus on speaking and comprehension ability, but overall I feel that my Arabic improved quite a bit throughout the class. Also, a very fun class environment.</comment>The more you put in to learning Arabic the more you will get out of the language.</comment>it's hard</comment>If you're learning Arabic, you obviously have to take it. The course does its job, but it's difficult and time-consuming.</comment>This class is very difficult. Not for the faint of heart.</comment>This class was disorganized and I didn't feel supported by the TF even if she was available for office hours. The instruction did not often make sense. I was often very confused when a rule was introduced and seldom mentioned again. While I think my knowledge of grammar is stronger now, I don't think my ability to speak in Arabic improved, and I have heard that in the Middle East these grammar rules are not even used by locals.</comment>Embrace the pain.</comment>You really need to be committed to Arabic and to expanding your vocab. Arabic B is often the most tedious class in the Arabic series, but it is also one of the most important since it teaches you the parts of the Arabic sentence.</comment>There is a lot of grammar involved and not a lot of speaking but that makes sense since MSA isn't spoken as commonly as the dialects. It's a difficult class but the professors are great!</comment>Be prepared to go a lot of grammar, but Hisham is an excellent teacher, Greg is an excellent TF, and the material is stuff you should know. If you want to continue with Arabic, this is the way to do it and its not so bad.</comment>This class is a great class to learn Arabic grammar and having Hisham is great because he cares so much about the language and teaches with such enthusiasm! I initially took Arabic to satisfy my language requirement but because of Hisham I have decided to pursue the language even more! Just be sure you are putting in the time that you need to make sure you have a good grasp of all of the grammar and vocab.</comment>Arabic is incredibly hard. It requires a lot and is incredibly frustrating but it is the most rewarding class I have taken at Harvard (despite not doing very well). Even though it is an elective and I'm taking it as a 5th class, it was worth it.</comment>The class is great, but there is a lot of busy work that doesn't really help you understand the material, and just takes up time. I also think that the professors are great, but your experience can definitely become unpleasant if you do not like your TF.</comment>Take it if you are committed to Arabic</comment>If you want to continue studying Arabic at Harvard, this is obviously the class to take. It's well-paced though the tests are significantly more difficult than Arabic A. Nour clearly cares about her students and wants them to do well.</comment>Ustadh Mahmoud's section is difficult, but his teaching style is engaging, fun, memorable, and he teaches us things we might not have seen otherwise, and tries to stay ahead of the curriculum so that we're seeing things for the second/third time by the time it comes around in Al Kitaab.</comment>It requires a lot of outside practice to learn all the vocabulary and texts.</comment>To be successful in this course, you need to commit to learning the vocabulary at the beginning of each unit</comment>Make sure to do the homework every day! Not only will it boost your grade but it'll make the learning process much easier.</comment>It's difficult, but a lot better than Arabic A, as now you feel like you have a grasp on the language. Take advantage of office hours; the teaching staff really want to see you succeed and they'll personally coach you on everything if you need it.</comment>An excellent course that solidifies the core grammatical concepts from Arabic A, while introducing you to more sophisticated constructions and vocabulary. Less intensive than first-year Arabic in my opinion, but that generally gives you enough time to digest the language.</comment></course>FOLKMYTH 171: Chinese New Year Pictures: Folk Art and Visual Culture</title>I think this class is only appropriate for graduate students, or perhaps for undergraduates writing a thesis on a related topic. The course is essentially a literature review of English-language articles on Chinese woodblock prints (of the 19th and 20th centuries). Unless you read Chinese, all the texts you'll study will be secondary sources, most of which are written in bland, highly academic prose. If you're thinking about taking this course, I recommend checking out James Flath's book, "The Cult of Happiness," and paging through it before deciding. I was the only student who took the class this semester, so I felt pressured to read everything on the syllabus. I literally read every single thing. Thus, I experienced the course largely as a demanding slog through dense, heavy articles punctuated by a two-hour weekly lecture. During class, Professor Lufkin would often show a slide and ask what Author X said about the print, so I never felt like I could skip the reading. She frequently emailed me to assign extra material, and I read all of that as well. For this class, I wrote nine response papers, all of them critiques of the scholarly literature assigned that week. Before I wrote the final paper, Professor Lufkin emailed me a reminder not to rely only on the sources on our syllabus, but to cite a good range of other publications. Too weak to protest, I gave up and just started reading.  Over the course of the semester, hundreds of powerpoint slides flashed before my eyes very quickly, as well as a few dozen prints in the MFA and Fogg collections. As a result, the only prints I remember well are the ones I analyzed for my final paper. After taking this course, I feel like I understand a little about Chinese woodblock prints, and a lot about how academics think. I spent 90% of my time looking at scholarly texts and 10% looking at images. I find this both interesting and hilarious, so I don't regret my decision to enroll. I also don't blame Professor Lufkin, who was very enthusiastic about the class, and just wanted me to absorb as much as possible. (She was very nice and brought snacks every week.) If you take this class, take it with a few friends. If the enrollment remains low however, seriously examine your commitment to going through this body of scholarly literature. I wouldn't recommend a course like this to any demographic but the most dedicated. The prints themselves are beautiful and worthy of study. But it's a tough course with an odd payoff, and you might find more enjoyment with a different syllabus.</comment></course>FRSEMR 23p: Physics, Math and Puzzles</title>It was really great to take it simultaneously with Physics 16. I didn't necessarily always realize it at the time, but throughout the course of the seminar I was learning how the materials covered in Physics 16 were extremely intertwined with the physics discussed in this seminar.</comment>Great seminar for students who are very interested in math and physics.</comment>This course seriously could not be better.</comment>Fun seminar. Homework is just to basically think about puzzles. If you're into math, physics, and puzzles, you're in the right place. Definitely more emphasis in physics than math. Only reservation about this seminar is that it's more lecture-based than I'd like (not as discussion-based).</comment>I wish there could a lot more courses like this one</comment>It's a bit of a timesink, but you'll find some lessons interesting</comment>This course is great. By the end of the class, you really do gain an appreciation for how physics, math, and puzzles are interrelated. Only take this class if you are genuinely interested in these topics. Do not just take it because it doesn't require a lot of work. Also, look forward to have food from Au Bon Pain every week during class. It is a pretty nice pick-me-up.</comment>This is a dope class.</comment>The workload is not heavy, but for the class to be good you have to think hard during the section.</comment>It seems to be less discussion based than many of the other freshman seminars, but it was a very enjoyable class and was very interesting.</comment>This class taught me a many different ways of thinking about a problem and provided me with an overview of many of the most groundbreaking ideas in the history of physics, all in a very relaxed setting. This class makes a very good balancing class for pset classes, while still providing some intellectual challenges. Strongly recommend.</comment>This course is a great way to find out if physics are for you without taking a rigorous course.  Dr. Vafa is so kind and loves the material: he honestly smiles when he presents a lot of it.  As a freshman, it was a very nice break to my otherwise loaded schedule.</comment>The course is neither time consuming nor difficult, but is still quite interesting. And, at least this year, Professor Vafa brings food from Au Bon Pan to every class!</comment>Dr. Vafa is a phenomenal professor and teaches a remarkably enjoyable course.  Vafa is infectiously enthusiastic.  The puzzle sets are short, but very much worth spending time to think about.  Really great class.</comment>Fun class that requires minimal work and shows you some startlingly beautiful facts about the universe and mathematics. Lots of brain candy!</comment>Lecture-heavy for a seminar. Very very manageable workload. Excellent instructor and topics. Students should be fairly comfortable with math and physics.</comment>You should really take this class if it at all appeals to you. The work is minimal, the content is exciting, and all the meetings are catered! Catered! Just a fantastic class: no stress and lots of learning.</comment>This course is incredibly for anyone who enjoys puzzles. The ties to math and physics concepts are incredibly well done, and you will be learning quite a bit about physics and mathematics in general. That being said make sure that you want to take a freshman seminar. This particular course attracts a lot of motivated students who often end up feeling dissatisfied with having taken an entire course with absolutely no credit value.</comment>It's not very much work at all but if you engage with the class you will love it and learn a lot. If you aren't very interested in math or physics you might feel like the time you spend in class is wasted.</comment>I enjoyed the class a lot. Professor Vafa is an excellent teacher who is very passionate about the subject. There is a minimal amount of work, but it is key to have a strong knowledge of physics and math, without that the class lectures can be very hard to follow.</comment>It's a great class and a great way to see how cool complex physics and math can be without the pressure of being tested on said complex physics and math.</comment>This class covers topics that are very conceptually challenging.  If you want to learn new things and develop your way of thinking, take this seminar!</comment>I would recommend this seminar to anyone with even a slight interest in physics. The content is made relatively accessible by Vafa and is truly mind-blowing.</comment>Great class, great teacher, very little work but you learn a lot.</comment></course>ECON 970: Tutorial - Sophomore Year</title>This class was great but the Stata p-sets take a significant amount of time.</comment>You learn a lot about how to think about economics and write well in the field.</comment>Take Ovul Sezer's course. She is an EXCELLENT instructor, a fair grader, super passionate about the class material, and very accessible & responsive to emails.</comment>It is requires a lot of reading but the material is very interesting and the assignments are not to difficult.</comment>Not the most exciting course, but you'll learn a lot and its required.</comment>Kiran is a remarkably engaging and passionate lecturer who is so wonderfully dedicated to the field of developmental economics. Just a note: this is an incredibly labor intensive course with difficult material and more assignments than comparable tutorials. Highly recommend taking this course after econometrics not concurrently, and only if you have a serious passion in going into the developmental economic field.</comment>JANE IS A GEM!!! Oh My Gosh!! I can't even begin to describe how great and down to earth she is! She is so willing to help you if you struggle a bit ( and I struggled through it sometimes), but she is so understanding. But of course, you have to be willing to reach out to her. I'm glad I did :) :) :) Jane is the best part of this class. Also, her own research is extremely interesting!</comment>I really liked it. I think there's a lot of readings but Kiran is amazingly nice and patient.</comment>Learn from Dorian, he has been my favorite TF i have had at Harvard</comment>It was a totally different take on economics, but I really enjoyed the subject.</comment>The class has a nice balance between social psychology and economics</comment>Dorian is the best instructor I've had at Harvard and nobody even comes close. His ultimate goal is to have every student come away with a better understanding of what really happened during the financial crisis, and along the way, you really learn how to write and think like an economist. He's incredible and I'd encourage everybody to sign up for his tutorial.</comment>Dorian is an awesome teacher. Although a bit boring at times, he generates enthusiasm for the topic and really cares about his students and teaching. The class is probably a bit easier than a lot of the other tutorials, but also equally (if not more) interesting.</comment></course>MATH 224: Representations of Reductive Lie Groups</title>The content of this course (224) varies greatly from year to year; be aware of this. Two years ago it covered finite dimensional Lie groups, last year it covered affine schemes, and this semester addressed the representation theory of infinite dimensional Lie groups. The material was challenging; however, Professor Schmid's lectures were very clear and good references were given. Overall, an extremely interesting subject where a lot of different fields intersect: algebraic geometry, differential geometry, harmonic analysis, and number theory.</comment></course>GOV 30: American Government: A New Perspective</title>Watch the videos and you'll crush the class.</comment>It is a very dry class that will require a lot of work outside the classroom in order to completely understand the material, but it provides great insight into American politics and the structure of the American government.</comment>This is a great class to learn the foundations of American government and politics. It builds off American history and ties it to current events (for example we wrote a paper about the Senate election that was going on at the time). I felt like this class was a great introduction to the Government department and was really interesting while not being too overwhelming and stressful. Make sure to watch the lecture videos before class (there are quizzes each class, but they are not difficult if you watched the video) and you will learn even more if you do the readings as well! Overall I really recommend this class.</comment>If you are looking to develop a greater understanding of the American Government, this class is the perfect course for you. If you are simply looking to become a more informed citizen, this class is perfect for you. This class looks at American Government in a way that many other American Government courses do not, which is refreshing. You will definitely exit this course an informed citizen better able to understand the politics of today.</comment>material is a bit repetitive</comment>Take it. Especially if you're looking for an easy to way to fulfill a gen-ed. 
This class is incredibly easy, and it's precisely because it's so easy that I felt I actually learned a lot. 
You have to work and keep up, but the absence of the stress of having to excel makes the learning process quite fun indeed. Do yourself a favor.</comment>Gov 30 was a great class. Take it if you are looking for a class with low weekly commitment.</comment>You won't have to do a ton of work, but you'll learn a lot and can get a great grade if you pay attention to the lecture videos.</comment>The structure is great</comment>Good introduction to American government, not very engaging</comment>Exactly what a Gen Ed should be: Learn a lot and stress a little. USW was the gen ed I was dreading to take, but this class was painless, interesting and informative. It is the ideal class for someone looking to brush up on their knowledge of American history, government and law. It felt good to fill the void of ignorance on some of the basic facts of American politics. The class takes you through the major Supreme court cases that have shaped America since its founding, and familiarizes you with the basics of tax and social policy, economic policy, foreign and defense policy, congressional decision making, interest groups, public opinion, civil liberties and rights, the modern court system, and, most importantly, our Constitution. I learned many new yet fundamental concepts each week. I honestly think everyone should take this class (or a class like it). No matter what field you're going to be a leader in, it is important to know the principals upon which our country stands and runs. And like I said, the work outside of class is minimal. You watch lecture videos and write one paper (maybe two next year, but that's it). Highly recommended.</comment>A good intro class and transition to college gov classes because most first semester freshmen have taken American history or gov in high school and will be easy to pick up on the course content</comment>Watch lecture videos and you will be fine. Lectures should not repeat what the videos say, but sadly, they do. Try to get Chris as your section TF, he is wonderful.</comment>This course really gives you wonderful insight into how and why the United States government works and what problems exist in this imperfect system. The workload isn't too bad and watching the lecture videos before class really does help with remembering the material.</comment>Easy, straightforward course. Doesn't require a lot of time.</comment>Peterson is adorable. He is passionate about the material and is a good lecturer. Definitely take this class if you're a Gov concentrator--it will be well worth your time. You cover a lot of material ranging from the ideology of the Founding Fathers to debating policy solutions for how to fix medicare. If you're not a Gov concentrator and are looking for an easy and relatively painless elective, this is a class well worth your time.</comment>the videos are tedious to watch and remember everything for the quiz the next day</comment>This course is a really great course to develop foundational understanding of American government.</comment>It is a very early course. Section and lecture are very helpful in understanding the material. Also, the videos are key to studying for the midterm and exams.</comment>This course seems like AP US history, but with an emphasis on judicial decisions. It was interesting to take during an year with elections. Unfortunately, Peterson pretty much repeats himself in lecture - you're required to watch a set of videos before each lecture (about 30-45 minutes).  Still, the reiteration of the material makes it easy to remember, so you won't feel lost as long as you're attending lecture.  Section is very chill and does a good job of clarifying important points. The exams were pretty straight forward, but make sure to memorize all relevant court cases. The essay questions are fairly open-ended, so as long as you can base your hypothesis with cases, you shouldn't have to worry.</comment>Good solid course.</comment>The class is pretty easy if you watch the lectures, and you learn quite a bit about America: past and present.</comment>I would say keep up with the lecture videos each night because you are quizzed almost everyday at the beginning of class.</comment>Great introductory course. The teaching staff is wonderful and makes you want to continuing leaning about the topics.</comment>I would say that it is good for learning about American government, but a lot of time is wasted.</comment>This is a great introduction to american government and a good way to experience what government classes at Harvard are like after school. The class covers everything you would want to know from the Founding Fathers to contemporary issues that are still being debated and I would highly recommend it.</comment>do your work and you'll get a good grade</comment>If you just take the 45 minutes to watch the course videos, you will be set for this class. Very light workload, very easy if you've ever taken any kind of American government course. The professor is a fantastic guy and the whole course is just a nice gut course to have on your schedule.</comment>This is a great, easy class. You basically watch the lectures online before class, then come in and discuss the topics. Highly recommend!</comment>The lecture videos Mr. Peterson puts up help a whole lot, but in person his lectures can be a bit repetitive.</comment>This course is a fairly bland, broad overview of American government. If you've already taken an American government class in high school, 80-90% of the material will be review. So, if you're concentrating or interested in Gov, it's a low workload, fairly easy class. But if you're looking for something a bit more probing or stimulating in the field of American government, it is probably better to look elsewhere.</comment>If you're looking for an interesting gov course that isn't too hard, I definitely recommend this class. Great way to learn more about the American political system, but you won't learn too much if you know a lot already. The class focuses a lot on Supreme Court cases, so consider it if that interests you.</comment></course>HAA 143r: The Art of the Court of Constantinople : Proseminar</title>This class is a hidden gem in the HAA department. Not only is Professor Kalavrezou the most charming lecturer, she makes you understand her passion for the objects and the slightly out-of-the-way field of Byzantine Art. The readings are light, there is only one paper, the lectures are always packed full of beautiful things that you will likely never see in any other HAA class. We also had a guest lecture with Professor Eurydice Georganteli, numismatist extraordinaire (I never thought coins were interesting before her lecture), and a trip to Dumbarton Oaks in D.C.! This was a wonderful experience, which really cemented our understanding of the objects we had seen in slides all semester.   If you are a concentrator, this will definitely broaden your horizons and make you look at Modern art and all other art that has come later in a completely different way. Very enriching.  I cannot recommend this class enough.</comment>This class is an absolute gem at Harvard. Among the kindest, most personable, and most passionate teachers at Harvard teaching about a subject on which she is among the foremost experts in the world. On top of that, the class is only about 12 people, so you get to know your fellow students and Prof. Kalavrezou herself. Finally, a chance to explore a really interesting period/region of art history that not many people in the world will ever get to learn about in such depth!</comment></course>US-WORLD 40: New World Orders? From the Cold War to Contemporary International Relations</title>If you're interested in US foreign policy and its history, this is the course for you!</comment>This course is certainly one of the best ways to fulfill the gen ed for USW. How much you enjoy it will largely depend on how interested you are in the material. The lectures are well-delivered and the course is competently administered. The caveats are those standard to a gen ed. Many students are there (myself one of them) simply to fill the requirement, and this will likely frustrate the more motivated and interested students.</comment>The course is structured well and the material was interesting. At times, it seemed like I was more reviewing things I had learned in high school- that is not necessarily a negative aspect though, for that material would be reinforced and teaching styles are always slightly different. The structure of the paper was also helpful with feedback provided.</comment>Take advantage of all the resources offered to you, and do research on the TFs</comment>This class is an easy one and a good introduction to the topic of US international relations if you have little background on the subject. Especially interesting if you're interested in Cold War politics. Overall, if you have taken an AP US History or European History course, you probably know most of the material taught here, but the professor is passionate and her lectures are thorough, if basic. A good 4th class that requires little to no outside work; the one paper assignment is easy to complete quickly and the exams are fair and straightforward.</comment>Great course! Professor Sarotte is wonderful, fun, and gives such clear and engaging lectures.</comment>USW40 is a fantastic gen-ed for someone interested in international relations. As a science major with a strong interest in international relations (Gov secondary), I was looking for a solid IR/history class to fulfill both the USW req and count as a Gov class, and I was so happy to get in USW40. Professor Sarotte is absolutely fantastic - she was a really great person to get to know in section, as she led fantastic informal discussions and really pushed students to think deeper about what they thought they already knew, and was very interested in how students were doing; it's unfortunate that she's leaving! If you are a student interested in fulfilling an easy gen-ed, this may not be the class for you because of the pretty demanding reading (for a gen-ed), but I would absolutely recommend anyone to take it that wanted to deepen and broaden their understanding of IR and history.</comment>It's really not that hard and you get to learn more modern history that you were never exposed to in high school.</comment>Take it, its easy</comment>It's more work than a typical gen ed, but it is worth it. The material is incredibly interesting. Most importantly, the teaching staff works with you on every assignment so you should be able to make good grades.</comment>It is a comprehensive and informative look at US relations during the cold war and beyond.</comment>This class is hands-down the best class I've taken at Harvard.  My knowledge coming out of it and my ability to actually understand the history of and implications of current events is incredible, and something I value so much!  Also, the teaching in this course is fantastic.  Professor Sarotte is one of the most knowledgable, intelligent, engaging, and friendly professors I've ever had--that's a hard combination to come by!  Added to this, the TFs are absolutely amazing as well, always willing to discuss topics further or help make my writing better.  I am so so sad Professor Sarotte is leaving after this semester, but the students at USC are in for a real treat when they take this class!</comment>Good lectures and straightforward requirements--not too difficult and provides a solid overview of important foreign policy issues that are important to understand</comment>Unfortunately, Professor Sarotte is no longer teaching this course, but if she was, I would tell everyone that they owe it to themselves to take it.</comment>The scope of the class is broad, but I'd definitely encourage you to take it if you're at all interested in American foreign policy/are looking for a more writing intensive Gen-Ed</comment>It's a relatively easy way to gain valuable knowledge about American foreign policy. The readings are not hard or too lengthy and there is only one essay, which is actually exciting because you get to choose the topic. Otherwise, the tests are also not difficult if you study properly and take solid notes.</comment>This was an absolutely fantastic course!! Professor Sarotte is one of the most gifted teachers I've ever had and she cares a great deal both about the course and about the students in it. I left with a very good grasp of US foreign policy over the past century. The assignments were completely fair and I actually enjoyed doing the research paper. It's such a shame that Professor Sarotte won't be back next semester to teach this class again as she goes back to USC.</comment>This course seems like it's built for freshmen, even though the material is really interesting. Good if you want built-in help for picking paper topics and for paper-writing skills</comment>This class was amazing! Pretty minimal work and it's interesting material. You do not have to do the readings to succeed, but you do need to get a one sentence summary on each from someone who did read.</comment>This was one of my favorite courses of the semester. The instructors are incredible and very knowledgeable of the material. The topics taught in this course prepare any individual well for discussing 20th century history and U.S. foreign policy.</comment>I loved this course. I felt that it broadened my understanding of US history and international relations, as well as extending the themes of the 20th century to today's world - such as through analysis of Russia's encroachment in Ukraine - preparing me to deal with a rapidly changing world in a constructive way.</comment>This course is not a ton of work but does well to introduce students to cool new Cold War themes.</comment>This is a great class and very interesting, but the workload is overwhelming, especially for a Gen Ed. The exams expect you to know really nitpicky details about events that happened, but we're still expected to read hundreds of pages a week. Sarotte is a great professor, and I wish I had gotten to know her personally.</comment>Do not take this class if you are looking for an in depth Cold War class. I thought that was what I was getting, and it ended up being a survey of 20th century history that was review from US and European history in high school. That said, the class is exceptionally well run, the paper writing process allows for a rough draft and feedback prior to the final grade, and Professor Sarotte is a fantastic lecturer.</comment>--</comment>Grading and feedback can be very reliant on which TF you choose</comment>This is a great class if your goal is to attain a solid understanding of American foreign policy since the first world war. It also acquaints one with the changing role of America in the world and looks at counterfactuals. Great great class!</comment>The class was awesome. The workload wasn't too bad at all and I think I genuinely learned a lot. Tests aren't too bad and overall, it's probably one of the best options to fulfill the gen ed requirement.</comment>This class was one of the most enjoyable history classes I've ever taken. It was my only option for a US/W gen-ed for a few reasons, but I am so glad that I took it. Every single lecture was extremely interesting and engaging. I looked forward to going to class as a fun way to start my morning. Also, sections were engaging. We reviewed key points from lecture and the readings and also engaged in some extremely interesting discussions. They were run in a way that really made everybody want to participate, and it seemed everybody had something valuable to contribute. Also, the paper is done in a way that isn't too stressful. Rather than forcing you to write something long (and frankly, bullshitty), they really stress writing effectively and meaningfully about something that you care about. I think this class is a great way to fulfill a gen-ed credit regardless of your concentration. Although be aware that there will most likely be big changes now that Professor Sarotte is no longer teaching the course.</comment>This is a great class that will teach you everything you've wanted to know about US-European and US-Asian relations.</comment>This class was fabulous! I would highly recommend it!</comment>Awesome class</comment>USW40 is interesting but mistreats students.  There are many stories even just within my friends in the class of Sarotte berating students and having pointlessly unflexible policies (while yelling at students who ask for exceptions). Thankfully, the teaching staff were quite pleasant.  The tests are set up so that students have to memorize minute details for 30 IDs only to be asked 2 of them on the tests.  They unfairly come down to luck and wrote memorization rather than learning (this is not a retaliation, I did well on the tests).  All in all, it is fascinating history, but needs to care more about students and Sarotte designing more fair and empathetic policies while treating them better herself would be a good start.</comment>This class is amazing! Highly recommend it.</comment>If this course is ever offered again and it looks at all interesting to you, take it.</comment>Great class to learn a lot of interesting information in! A little more work than a typical GenEd, but still worth it.</comment>This is a great history course for everyone with an interest in history and how it relates to current events--what with the events unfolding in Russia these days, it was very topical.</comment>So I'm pretty sure Sarotte is never teaching this class again but if someone else does, I would say this is a really good balancing class for gov concentrator a. It's so basic that it's fairly easy to skate by throughout the course of the semester and then hone in to prepare for the exams. It's a good class for freshmen trying to transition to college because it will remind you of how a high school class is run.</comment>Unfortunately Professor Sarotte won't be here next semester, which dampens my enthusiasm a bit; she really made the class. Her enthusiasm for the material really pervaded the lectures and made them a lot of fun to listen to.  In any case, the course material is really important and it gives you a broad overview of American foreign policy since WWI, which really enhances your understanding of critical issues of today.</comment>Very interesting but also very rigorous</comment>Great material. Great lecturer. Incredible insight. Take it.</comment></course>BE 121: Cellular Engineering</title>Great class that informs you the current state of synthetic biology. Teaches you a lot of practical advice in terms of proposal writing and presenting innovative science.</comment></course>SWAHILI 101ar: Reading in Swahili</title>Swahili 101ar with Judith is amazing, as always. Judith is a great instructor and really pushes you to challenge yourself in reading the Swahili literature. It is a low time commitment, but gives you the chance to really learn how to read Swahili in a small setting.</comment></course>EXPOS 10.002: Introduction to Expository Writing</title>Expos has a reputation as the worst class you'll ever take at Harvard, especially Expos 10 because you don't even get to choose the subject you're writing about. This is completely untrue. I loved Expos 10 because, as a potential science concentrator it was my one discussion-based class and it gave me a break from pests. The small class size meant I got to know all my classmates pretty well and I got to know the preceptor. Dr. Mumme is really cool and cares a lot about making the class interesting. I learned all the writing techniques I needed to move forward writing academic things and I just learned a lot in general because the topics I was reading and writing about were so interesting.</comment>Expos 10 allowed me to be more confident in the way I write academic papers.</comment>Do it if you think you need extra feedback. Expos 10 is helpful because its students receive very detailed feedback.</comment>This is great introduction to expos 20.</comment>I never had experience with writing in English before. I never wrote a single paper before coming to Harvard. I think they do a pretty good job in introducing you to academic writing by first giving you small tasks that with time become bigger writing assignments and finally papers. The preceptor is very supportive and understanding, and her feedback is awesome! Go to office hours! Send emails with drafts! They are here to help and they would do anything for you to get the best out of the course. Don't be scared to ask for extensions when necessary (when actually necessary)</comment></course>ENGLISH 157: The Classic Phase of the Novel</title>MUST TAKE COURSE AT HARVARD! The best way to read some of the greatest works ever written. Prof. Fisher is definitely my favorite professor so far, so do yourselves a favor and take this course before you graduate. Stephen Squibb is also an amazing tf if you ever get him.</comment>Great lectures but rather disorganized. KEEP ON TOP OF YOUR READINGS FROM WEEK TO WEEK! I ended up reading two novels the day before the final and it was hell.</comment>This class was far and away the most incredible class I've taken in my four years at Harvard. Professor Fisher is an incredible teacher, and the TFs clearly have a genuine passion for the books. In addition, the TFs care immensely about their students and will go out of their way to make themselves accessible. This class fundamentally changed my perspective on some things in life -- if you're looking for something to fulfill your A&I requirement, absolutely take this class. Couldn't recommend it enough.</comment>Prof Fisher is amazing. I have taken two classes with Prof Fisher and wish I could take more. The class is a lot of work but you get a lot out of it.</comment>Great books. Amazing professor. You won't regret it.</comment>Best class ever. Take this class, take it pass fail if you have to (though be wary the english department is great about grades), but take this class. My favorite class in my 4 years here by a long shot. I love the books, and only if lecture wasn't at 10am.</comment>Phil Fisher is a genius. If you don't take a course with him while you're at Harvard, you will almost certainly regret it.</comment>KEEP UP WITH THE READINGS. You will get so much more out of the class than if you fall behind.</comment>This is a great class for anyone who has an interest in the readings (which include Austen, Dostoevsky, Mann, Tolstoy, Eliot), and is willing to put effort into thinking about and responding to them. Professor Fisher's insights on both individual scenes and the novel as a whole are uniformly fascinating and brilliant, and you'll learn to appreciate the books in entirely new ways even if you've read them before. The readings and papers do require a significant amount of time and effort, but are all extremely rewarding, and you'll have a lot of help with them from class and section!</comment>professsor fisher is a treat</comment>Of course this class does require a lot of reading, but the opportunity to take a class from Professor Fisher is really not to be missed. Do try to stay on top of the reading, however. As soon as you fall behind, you never really catch up.</comment>yes, the books are long.  but they are worth it.  as is lecture.  it's fast and furious.  but fantastic.</comment>Really great class - but take if you have time to do a *lot* of reading.</comment>This is a dream of a course. I had heard from many people that taking a class with Professor Fisher ought to be a requirement before graduation, and now I wholeheartedly agree! The fact that the course was so well-run, and that I had an amazing section and TF, felt like a lucky bonus.</comment>you have got to read a little everyday.</comment>Awesome class! Very accessible to people who haven't done much English before but still want to learn a lot!</comment>The reading is the best part, and lecture is quite good. The grading is very harsh and that is discouraging.</comment>It's an incredible chance to read really great novels, in a really cool setting, but they have to be willing to read a bunch every week.</comment>I had never taken a literature class before this (I took this for AIU credit), but I felt by the end of it, I had learned a tremendous amount about literature/textual analysis/English as a discipline. Great class, great books, great teaching staff. Be prepared to spend a ton of time reading though.</comment>Professor Fisher's lectures were life changing. Marissa was also one of the best TFs I have had at Harvard. She gave extremely detailed and helpful feedback, and was always available outside of class to discuss ideas. For me, even as a CS concentrator, I found that this class was well structured and well taught enough that I could really enjoy it and follow along. Fair warning: it's an average of 200 pgs of novel reading per week.</comment>It's a kind of unbearable amount of reading, but worth it in many ways -- the texts are amazing and professor Fisher is a joy.</comment>This class was amazing! Professor Fisher's lectures are astounding and the teaching staff is so supportive and helpful. This being said, the workload is intense. We blew through 800 page novels in two weeks, and often I  wished that we could have slowed down to better appreciate the reading. You should be prepared to commit at least one hour every day of the week for the reading. At least. But, if you can manage the reading-load, take it! You'll be glad that you did.</comment>Read some ahead of time, or get really good at reading very fast. There is an absolutely huge amount of reading.</comment>This was my first English class, though I've long had an interest in literature, especially 19th century novels. This is by far the best class I've taken at Harvard, with extremely inspiring lectures by Prof. Fisher, insightful and enthusiastic TF (I was in Marissa's section), and of course very engaging novels. The only word of caution is the workload. I went into the class having read two of the five novels, and still ended up spending a lot of time reading and re-reading. That said, this class is a great enjoyment for those genuinely interested.</comment>You should definitely, absolutely take this course!!! Professor Fischer teaches so well, and the support from the TFs (go Marissa!) is amazing. I received so much helpful feedback throughout the course. Although it is a significant amount of reading, the lectures and sections discussions really help to make it easier and clue you into little nuances that make the reading even more fun!</comment></course>ANTHRO 1210: The Archaeology of Ancient China</title>I highly recommend this course. It gives a wonderful overview about China from Paleolithic to the late Shang dynasty. The professor is great and it also has an interesting student museum project, where the whole class creates an exhibition on display in the Peabody Museum at Harvard.</comment>This class is really interesting and fun! You get to participate in cool activities like burning oracle bones, examining burial goods from the Bronze Age, and putting together a museum exhibit at Peabody. Just make sure you take really good notes and keep up with Professor Flad's speed during lectures and you'll be fine.</comment></course>HEB 1590: Ancient Biomolecules</title>If you're interested in examining biomolecules from many different angles this class is for you.</comment>Great way to knock out an HEB requirement. Very chill class. Problem sets are pass/fail...</comment>This class was the easiest I took this semester. I was kind of shocked as to how little time this class took up every week. There was virtually no work, and even the lectures did not last the entire hour and a half. I think the fact that the class was so relaxed helped me learn more, since I did not feel pressured tofocus on arbitrary points just for the sake of doing well on a pset or exam. And I loved Professor Tuross :)</comment>Professors and material are engaging. Really emphasizes understanding the material rather through extensive feedback in problem sets.</comment>Really interesting material and very low workload, although that might be changed in the future since this was the first time the course was being offered</comment>This is a great course!  It teaches different material from other HEB courses, which can get repetitive, and emphasizes hands on and in depth learning over rote memorization.  Fair psets, fair final, fair grading and expectations.</comment>This course is very interesting and forces you to question how we know what we think we know about the past. You get the opportunity to learn how these studies are conducted and their limitations. You become a better consumer of scientific literature. The course does not require much work because problem sets were pass fail and the final was take home. That being said you never really know where you stand in the course.</comment>Take it. Super chill and interesting. I looked forward to go to class every Tuesday and Thursday even though it interrupted my nap time.</comment>This course is new so there's still a lot of work to be done! It was interesting and not a huge workload. The teaching staff are lovely but the whole class feels a little.. lost. I think it will become more concrete with each year tho.</comment>This class is WONDERFUL. Professor Tuross, Dr. Reynard, and Jon are dedicated, engaging, and fascinating teachers. The course focuses on a number of topics that are supplemented by case studies so students can have both a broad review of the study of ancient biomolecules yet a comprehensive understanding of specific topics. The psets are manageable and interesting and the work load is very light. These aspects do not make the course "easy." Active participation and interest is still required but the structure and teaching staff allow that to occur naturally. I learned substantially from this course and would take it again in a heartbeat. All courses at Harvard should be organized in this manner, especially small seminars like this one. Take it, but Prof. Tuross/Dr. Reynard: Keep it small!</comment>A fun and engaging way to get a look at an incredible field that most don't know about and that is in the news a surprising amount!  The teaching staff is very accessible and make the material interesting.  The emphasis on application of material that is learned make it one of the most relevant classes you can take.</comment></course>ASTRON 2: Celestial Navigation</title>It's a very different experience from what you will get in your normal classes. The skillset required is also very different - it's a lot of working with details and making very precise measurements. One mistake will screw up your whole reduction. The math itself isn't that hard but the material is hard in it's own way because of all the details you must keep track of. Phil and Eliza are really great and totally make the class. Can be a really cool experience if you want to try something new.</comment>This course is not easy, but it absolutely changed how I look at the world. I love being able to actually understand the night sky and predict what will happen based on (really counter-intuitive) models that we developed in class. Really an amazing experience.</comment>This courses provides a fun, instructive, and exciting way to delve into a field of study that may not have even previously crossed your mind. The enthusiastic and unique styles of teaching masterfully blend theoretical study and practical application into the perfect course.</comment>Astro 2 is an unique course that's unlike anything you've probably taken so far at Harvard - there's very little lecture and class is spent primarily on lab-like activities helping you learn navigation techniques based on the position of the sun, moon, and stars. I definitely see the sky a lot differently after this class - it really challenges your preconceptions about, for instance, where the sun and moon are in the sky at any given date. Phil and Eliza are great and help to create an engaging learning environment, and psets and exams are reasonable and fairly graded. However, I would note that this class absolutely eats your Tuesdays. 5 hours of class in one day is tough, and I often left at 10 feeling exhausted even though I didn't have any other commitments that day. This goes twice if you live in the Yard or on the river, as it's quite a trek up to class (on the other hand, it's one of the most Quad-friendly classes in terms of location that you can take).</comment>This is undeniably a course at Harvard you must take before you graduate.</comment>This is an amazing class. The subject is very interesting and you learn not only about astronomy and navigation but also about how to learn. Phil and Eliza are wonderful teachers who truly care about your success in the class. They will go out of their way to make sure you understand the material. The class will consume your Tuesdays and sometimes more time than you expect but it is worth it. (That time will go into whale-watching trips and museum visits that are definitely worth your time).</comment></course>CHNSE 140a: Advanced Modern Chinese</title>This class is awesome! I love the Chinese language department, and the teachers were great and helpful. They were also flexible and understanding.</comment>Definitely a big jump from 130a/b, but very rewarding! The topics of conversation become very real world.</comment>Gao Lasohi is a fantastic lecturer and the class is fun. Even though it meets every day, I enjoy my time in 140.</comment>Study the review sheets and the grammar notes.</comment>Just make sure that you check the upcoming weekly schedule IN ADVANCE on Sundays. If you do so, and you start looking at the texts and new words early, it will make you learn the material better and spend less time overall.</comment>This class focuses on teaching you lots of vocabulary and grammatical structures in a very short amount of time. You'll blow through longish essays and passages each week, focusing on the vocab that the teachers emphasize. The teachers will skip over certain vocab words in the list or even unfamiliar non-vocab words in the text, so watch out for that. The teachers also try to teach you speed-reading in Chinese by making you scan a passage one paragraph at a time and then going through sentence by sentence. I feel like my oral fluency and comfort in conversational situations decreased, while my ability to read advanced passages increased and my ability to write at an advanced level remained about the same, as I noticed myself and my peers falling back on familiar, non-advanced vocab.</comment>Chinese 140a is an awesome course!  It has fantastic teaching staff that are very engaged and highly accessible.  I learned a lot and made many new friends.  I would strongly recommend this course to anyone thinking about taking it.</comment>This class is not as good as its predecessors.  It is way less fun than Bx, 123xb, HBA.  Although the topics you discuss should be interesting, and you are really just learning more formal ways to say things that you mostly know how to say, this class was pretty painful.  The material (vocab, grammar, chengyu) is difficult to retain and seems pretty irrelevant.  I didn't see much improvement in my Chinese.</comment>Take it, but know that it'll be kind of a pain. You'll be reading about social issues in China and random Chinese essays, so it's not gonna be super fun. I kinda messed around in the class and question how much I actually learned, but I think that it could be helpful.</comment>I really loved this class and it was the perfect continuation of Chinese 130. The grammar concepts can be difficult but the teachers in this class are extremely dedicated and make sure you understand the material well by the end of each lesson. Assignments were similar to those in 130 if not a bit more demanding. Gao Laoshi, as always, was incredibly enthusiastic and a fantastic teacher overall. Zhang Laoshi and Zhu Laoshi were also very helpful in section and provided thorough feedback on assignments. Take this class!</comment>This class is a ton of work, but to really learn Chinese, this is what it takes.  The teachers are fantastic and will help you at every step of the way.</comment>Chinese 140 is just like any other Chinese class, but you also learn a little bit about Chinese culture. It's a piece of cake if you're coming from 130x.</comment>Stay up to date with the work, review a bit each day, and you really should have no problems!</comment>If you've come this far in Chinese, you will not be disappointed by Chinese 140! The teachers are fantastic, as per usual in the Chinese department, and the class covers interesting and nuanced topics like 胡同文化 and 流行音乐。</comment>This class is a good taste of what formal Chinese looks like. The teachers really care about the students and you won't regret taking it.</comment>This is a really good class, but the level is pretty high.</comment>This course definitely improves your written Chinese to a huge degree, but be prepared for quite a bit more work and higher expectations than in 130.</comment>Very good for Chinese speaking; this is the first time I have really felt my speaking, reading and writing skills improve in a Chinese course.</comment>I would definitely tell them to be prepared to do a lot of intensive work. A lot of the intensive work is beneficial.</comment>I am now able to read more in Chinese than I could before, but reading a newspaper article is still a bit of a struggle. The class is very well organized and the teachers are great.</comment></course>FRSEMR 27i: Global Health: Comparative Analysis of Healthcare Delivery Systems</title>Pretty easy course to sail by in, but pretty dry. Don't take if you actually want to get some productive learning done in your freshman seminar.</comment>This class does not require a considerable amount of work. but the professors are great at leading fluid class discussions and bringing in exceptional guest lecturers, so student learning definitely happens. Also, Sanjay and Garry are excellent resources and encourage students to reach out to them to make connections with professionals, especially in the medical field (although I think this class is valuable for students interested in policy, government, etc, not just medicine).</comment>I loved this class so much. Dr. Saini and Dr. Choy are the greatest ever.</comment>This class is what you make of it. Readings aren't technically required, and you won't be tested on them or necessarily need to cite them in discussions. However, if you want to learn the material you should do the readings, and I regret not doing many of them. You can just sit in the back and not participate and essentially do nothing for this class, but then it's a waste of a class at Harvard.</comment>Do the readings and participate in discussions and you will get a lot out of this course.</comment>Very informative but low workload. Definitely take if you're interested in health policy/global health</comment>Don't expect good discussion, but do expect great guest lecturers!</comment>This class is a very reasonable commitment, though try to stay on top of the readings because they can pile up! The speakers that Dr. Saini and Dr. Choy bring in/skype are generally fascinating and very inspiring.</comment>The first couple of classes start off slowly, but then the seminar begins to pick up. The guest speakers are the best part in my opinion. You will learn the most from them. The discussions and questions in the seminar are thought-provoking and engaging. You will touch upon many topics, but not go too in-depth into any one.</comment></course>FRSEMR 35w: Sex, Gender, Shakespeare</title>This is a great class if you like Shakespeare! Dr. Graham is very knowledgeable and will provide you with great historical background to better understand his works. The format of the class is very manageable; you read a play each week and write three essays. The essays can seem overwhelming because her assignments are very vague, but she will clarify if you ask her too. Overall, this was a very fun class! I recommend it!</comment>If you don't want a reading intensive course don't take it. Though the readings are discussed in class discussions and it is a seminar, so it's not that bad. But it gets awkward sitting in the room for 2 hours if you haven't done the reading, so if you don't like reading Shakespeare a few hours a week I wouldn't suggest taking this class.</comment>This course is a wonderful option for anyone interested in the humanities, whether you are a prospective concentrator or not. Thankfully, as a freshman seminar, it is not stressful, and the discussions are fun and thought-provoking. The writing assignments are not laborious, and they are very helpful in developing your analytic skills and writing style. This was especially invaluable since I did not have Expos until the second semester. A semester of Shakespeare may seem a little daunting, but if you go along for the ride, it will definitely be a worthwhile experience.</comment>If you like Shakespeare this is the class for you but if you do not then it can be pretty brutal.</comment>It is incredibly interesting to think about the sex and gender components of Shakespeare in closer detail than is normally present in high school discussions of Shakespeare. This class is extraordinary for doing so.</comment>This class was wonderful because Professor Graham is literally a genius.  She knows everything about everything, and learning from her is basically the dream.  If you like Shakespeare and WGS, take it.</comment></course>HIST 83c: Care of the Soul</title>These books are very important to read and will definitely offer a great perspective on life - some of them will even change your life! Hankins is adorable. Take this class to have good discussions. There is a very long end term paper though...</comment>Through the works of a fascinating range of Eastern and Western philosophers, this class helped me to see happiness, ethics and the world differently. However, it requires a lot of reading and at least some background in philosophy, and classes can be a little dry.</comment>Take this class! It's a class that makes you think with a professor who makes you genuinely want to engage.</comment>Take this class if you would really like to know about some of the core components of several popular historically significant philosophies.</comment>This was a great class! Professor Hankins a humorous and laid-back attitude for discussions and is well informed on the topic. He is clearly passionate about philosophy. This is not a traditional history course, but it teaches the information effectively.</comment>Definitely take this class! Professor Hankins is one of my favorite professors and Nate is an incredibly helpful TF. The topic material is not only interesting but will actually affect the way your view your life and your values (in a positive way!).</comment></course>ENGLISH Cbbr: Intermediate Poetry: Workshop</title>If you want to become a better poet, taking a workshop here is probably one of the best things you can do as a student. Professor Bell is super great at helping you tailor your work to your own aims. I definitely feel like I walked out with a greater appreciation of poetry and a better sense of my own style</comment>If you have any interest in creative writing/poetry writing and you want to improve your craft, you should take this course.</comment>You will explode in creativity through uncomfortable challenges that will only make you better--in English and in poetry.</comment>Easily my favorite class of my first semester.</comment>Absolutely incredible class. Don't be put off by the "intermediate" title: Josh puts great effort into making this course tailored specifically to you, meant to challenge your own voice. I felt completely challenged, as did my classmates, even though our challenges were very different. Also, my poetry improved and developed dramatically in my mind, as I have begun to find my true, consistent voice. I think that is proof enough of the exceptional nature of this course. A class with Josh Bell must be included in your 32 courses at Harvard.</comment>This class is incredible. Listening to Josh Bell talk about poetry and language in general is inspiring. He approaches all students' work with such respect and energy. Also, this is not just a class for English majors -- if you love poetry and have written some before, it's so worth at least applying, regardless of what you plan to do with writing in the future.</comment>Josh is awesome! It's a really fun course that doesn't require much work. It is what you make of it. There isn't much feedback in terms of grades, but Josh gives a TON of feedback in terms of your poetry work.</comment>First, a shoutout for Josh. He has the unique ability to be both sharply analytical and encouraging in his comments about your poems. He is incredibly kind and understands what you are trying to get across in your work. He can also pick up on a whole range of subtleties that others would have missed (changes in tone, implications of your ideas, any other speakers/voices in the poem, etc) Incredible! 

There was a real sense of camaraderie in this course. We're all a little nutty. We write our life philosophies into our work. We try new styles. We dare. As I watched my friends innovate, I learned so much from innovating beside them. I also developed more confidence in my voice and a keener eye as I critiqued my own writing. I came out a sharper and more creative writer. This is education as it should be.</comment>Josh is a fantastic teacher -- super insightful and works really hard to help students with their specific needs as poets and thinkers. Yet he is also very laid back and the class environment is really relaxed but also positive and constructive. I grew a lot in how I think about approaching the study of poetry as a whole (not just writing my own -- which I also improved at dramatically and had not had any previous experience with).</comment>This was the best class I've taken at Harvard. If you have any interest in writing poetry, take it! Josh is an incredible instructor who creates a comfortable class atmosphere where it's possible to take risks and try things out. The class didn't have a lot of work but I found myself wanting to spend hours and hours every week on my poems.</comment></course>YORUBA A: Elementary Yoruba</title>This is an easy courses and less time consuming than other language courses. However I do not feel like I am learning the language at a good pace, it feels very slow and I wonder when I will be able to communicate.</comment>This class is a non-taxing class that will require minimal work and still teach you a great deal about the language.</comment>Did not learn as much as I would have hoped because the class was very easy and we did not work enough to practice language in and outside of class in a way that developed our vocabulary.</comment>If you simply do the assignments, you will fall behind. You need to always pay attention in class.</comment>take it, it's lovely.</comment></course>SCAND 90r.b: Finnish</title>First, Finnish is an awesome language -- don't be scared by the case system.  Second, Saana is a wonderful teacher. She will teach at a pace that works for the people in the class, is very enthusiastic and energetic, and understands that life happens. If you're at all interested in learning Finnish, take this course. You will learn a lot.</comment></course>ETH-REASON 39: Money, Markets, and Morals</title>This is one of the greatest class you can ever imagine. Professor Sandel's charisma at the lecture is unpointed. Anyone from any background will find the material useful and accessible. This is one of the classes I will sincerely recommend to anyone!</comment>Great class, lectures are really interesting, everything seemed to connect well. The papers are graded a little harshly, but overall I think the class was not too difficult.</comment>This was an incredible class with interesting lectures and engaging discussions.</comment>Professor Sandel is an incredible lecturer. He is able to facilitate a rounded discussion in a class of over 200 people. The subject matter is thought provoking and challenging, but in a fantastic way. Sections are clarifying and interesting.</comment>This is an incredible course in which you will get to hear novel discussions and thoughts of Harvard students about extremely polarizing issues such as surrogate pregnancy and organ sales among many other topics. You will absolute love it. Make sure you get a good TF though, because upon discussing my section experiences with others, I did feel that certain TFs (such as mine) were more approachable than others. Utilize your TF's expertise! Talk to them about your paper before writing it, it will do go tons of good. Also, go to Prof. Sandel's office hours because you might not always get called on in class (even though he does a pretty decent job at getting around the room). This class will make you question your own beliefs and values, though, so if that excites you, this is one class you have GOT to take.</comment>Make sure you get a fair TF.</comment>This is by far the absolute worst class I have ever taken at Harvard and I would not dare wish taking it upon my worst enemy.  While lectures start out interesting, by week 3 they get old as Professor Sandel starts to hammer home the same 3 points over and over and over again, offering almost nothing new to the class.  You end up learning next to nothing (honestly, read his book and you'll learn three times as much as you do in the class), and you get stuck in sections with students that try and just answer whatever they think the TF wants to hear, and TFs that dock points simply because they disagree with you.  The grading is entirely subjective and makes no sense, while the new "writing style" the class focuses on you will never need to use again because it is just so blatantly irrelevant to the real world.  I took this class because I heard positive things about Sandel; I urge you to seriously reconsider any inclination you may have towards taking this class.</comment>Great class, I highly recommend taking.</comment>Your opinion on the course will depend on your TF.</comment>Great class, but if you took Justice already I wouldn't recommend this class because they cover a lot of the same material</comment>The course is good, but can get a little tiring at times. I still have no clear idea of how I was supposed to write the response papers. The section component was good if you had a good TF.</comment>This is a great work for a number of reasons. For one, it is a great way to fulfill ethical reasoning. It is extremely interesting and the material will stick with you for a really long time because none of it is based on memorization. Rather, everything is discussion bases and all the assignments are essays (there are no in class exams). The course will give you a framework to talk about real-world moral issues. Further, the course is not very demanding and is very flexible in terms of workload. You get to CHOOSE when you write essays. This is extremely nice by the teaching staff and makes life much easier as you can choose to write when you are less busy or on topics that are most interesting to you. Overall, awesome class. Highly, highly recommend.</comment>This is a class that challenges your thinking so the assignments reflect that thought process</comment>An incredibly interesting class.  Unfortunately, you spend most of lecture listening to classmates (often times making fools of themselves) and don't get as much out of the experience as you could if Sandel would teach more of the time.  Hopefully, if this course is offered again, he changes that component of the course.  If he doesn't, watch out for really boring lectures.</comment>Awesomely intersting, fascinating</comment>Some of the material is dumbed down a bit, but all in all this is a good, thought-provoking class.</comment>Please take this class! If you get in, you'll be very lucky. It is very enriching, and useful outside of an academic environment.</comment>It is a course that has tangibly changed my way of thinking of the world around me. The course touches on many controversial moral cases related to the market (and as we live in a market economy, all these issues are very related to daily lives). How to formally develop and form one's moral opinion on issues is an important skill every Harvard students who hope to be future leaders should acquire, and this course has definitely helped me develop such skill. It teaches one how to logically and rationally weigh different reasonings on a moral issue by comparing and distinguishing similar cases, building hypothetical thought experiments, and borrowing views from influential philosophers in the past. Workload is quite manageable, but the grading though can be really really harsh (it is the harshest graded Gen-Ed I have taken).</comment>This class is amazing! Really cool to not only think about your own views on a variety of cases but also hear what other classmates have to say.</comment>This class is incredibly interesting and equips you with a lot of opinions.</comment>This is a decent course that can get a little repetitive and is heavy on anecdotes at the expense of talking about the philosophers.</comment>This is a really interesting class with fascinating case studies, but my biggest reservation is that lectures were very much hit or miss. Professor Sandel has an interesting teaching style, facilitating discussions within the lecture. This either resulted in great insights from multiple students, or a really slow moving lecture if he was constantly asking questions to one student, in which case it felt like 200 students sitting in on and listening to an office hours conversation. The cases you will explore, though, are fascinating and I often continued the discussions with friends outside of the class.</comment>Be sure you do the readings. You will get more out of class that way. Also, go to office hours! They prepare you to write the papers, and discussing the course topics with Professor Sandel should be its own reward.</comment>This is a very good class! Sandel is an incredibly engaging lecturer, and I was very rarely bored. (Note that all lectures are mandatory, and attendance was taken on random days. I would by no means consider this a negative, but it's something to be aware of.) The readings are really interesting. Most come from newspapers or magazines. Aside from a few weeks spent on moral theory, the rest of the readings I could have easily picked up in my spare time and enjoyed. The work load is incredibly minimal as well—only 4 1000-word papers over the course of the whole semester. As long as you're even remotely interested in morality and markets, take this class! It definitely taught me to think about the world in ways I never expected.</comment>This was an amazing class that brought real-world situations into the classroom for a chance to discuss the ethical side of each of them. While it opens your eyes to philosophy in a way that can't be done just by reading old philosophers, be prepared to leave class fully understanding both sides of the argument but not having a clear answer on which path to take to be most ethical. One of the best classes at Harvard for sure!</comment>This course is super rewarding. It makes people think about a lot of issues that they may have already formed an opinion on, and challenges people to support their own ideas. It definitely helped me improve as a writer, and widened my view on issues that we discussed.</comment>Take this course! It will challenge the way you think about issues relevant to our society. When faced with issues that strike you as wrong, this class will teach you how to effectively defend your objections on concrete, carefully considered grounds.</comment>Despite its tendency to repeat points, this course is fascinating and changes the way you think about markets.</comment>An easy gen ed, pretty repetitive for anyone who's studied philosophy before. There are probably a lot of more fulfilling courses if you're deeply interested in philosophy. Sandel is a good lecturer, but he's also fond of asking for opinions for the class, which can get tedious and repetitive. Try to get Charlie as a TF if he's still teaching - he was very good at explaining concepts to people who'd never heard of them before, while still keeping section from getting too boring for people with a broader philosophy background.</comment>This is an amazing course and Sandel is a great lecturer. However, you need to have a background in philosophy. Otherwise, it is extremely difficult to do well in this course. The TFs really harp on individual philosophers and if you do not jump on that bandwagon, and focus more so on your own arguments, your grade will suffer.</comment>Incredible class. Very well organized. Lively discussions. Sandel is a fantastic lecturer and not to be missed. This class will give you a whole new way of thinking. Thought provoking, difficult course, but well worth the time. Perfect introduction to ethics and philosophical thinking. And you will have endless tricky and interesting case studies to challenge your friends with.</comment>This is a pretty awesome course. You gain a toolbox of ways to approach ethical issues which is really cool. I like this because many things we know are ethically wrong, but before the course were difficult to argue in that direction since practically the unethical things is better. Charlie is a great TF. He will give you valuable feedback and teach you what you are doing wrong in your essays so you can really improve your political philosophy writing skills</comment>This is a very strong class, and Sandel is a great professor. The emphasis on discussion is one of the most enriching parts of the course, because students get to hear other students' opinions, while Sandel shapes the discussion. The workload is not particularly high, and the readings are very interesting. Pay attention during the weeks on the philosophers (Kant, Aristotle, etc) because that will appear on the final.</comment>This class will challenge you intellectually, and it will transform the way you think about ethics, and the way you should act in your day to day life. The class forces you to examine deep, pertinent questions regarding the role of money and markets in society. It is not a very difficult course, and the workload is very manageable. Michael Sandel is also a tremendous lecturer, and all Harvard students should take one of his classes before they graduate.</comment>Take the class if you are interested in the subject material. You'll learn a little bit of political philosophy, but largely the class is about how we should think about market practices today. The conclusions are not particularly profound, but the course helps you break down the ethical dimension of different issues.</comment>Take this class if you can lottery into it! Sandel is such an amazing professor that makes lectures very fun and interactive! I never noticed the time go by when I was listening to (and sometimes participating in) the debates unfolding in class. While the class is challenging is definitely manageable and the TFs (especially Charlie!) are really great and helpful. It's a course that's well organized and thought-out.</comment>Sandel breaks down the subjects and topics really well. Great moderator and excellent topics.</comment>Wonderful class. If you're interested in any social science and are interested in politics/law/ethics then you will love this class. If you're only looking for a gen ed, this class doesn't require any background knowledge and can be very interesting.</comment>The course is awesome. It is very interesting to take the course while/after you take/took an introductory Economics course such as Ec10, but I think this class is extremely interesting anyway.</comment>It's very thought provoking and brings up interesting discussion.</comment>This class is the only one in my five semesters at Harvard so far for which I did not miss a single lecture.  Professor Sandel's lectures were often the highlight of my academic week.  There is no class like this.  It is engaging, thought-provoking, and hands down one of the best classes at Harvard.  If you get in, taking it is a must.  And Charlie is a great TF; choose his section if he is still TFing the course.</comment>TAKE IT, and make sure you get into Charles Lesch's section. I am sure there are some other good TFs, but hands down Charles is outstanding and he will give you a great section experience. The class is not just about money and markets. You actually come away knowing quiet a bit about philosophers in general.</comment>INCREDIBLE</comment>TAKE THIS COURSE! It is absolutely amazing! The case studies are fascinating and the philosophers studied were manageable. Professor Sandel is an engaging lecturer and the TFs are absolutely top notch. The essays are a wonderful way of handling the materials presented in class and are not too demanding.</comment>This class is so relevant to every person's life and inspires you to think about the moral framework behind many of our society's accepted practices, and why other similar practices are not acceptable. This is the kind of course that you would want everyone elected to a public office to have taken because the questions are so pertinent. Also, Sandel prepares the lectures phenomenally, the discussions are interesting, and you pick when you will write your papers and what they will be about. Best class I've ever taken (and it isn't very hard either).</comment>If you're taking this course just for a gen ed, don't. Do ER18. As one who's taken both, the latter is much more interesting and easier. This course done for a gov political philosophy requirement is probably one of the more painless ones but Sandel did not live up to the hype this year (which is disappointing because he totally could)</comment>This class is awesome. Professor Sandel's ideas are intriguing and his office hours themselves make the class worth it. Sometimes the Socratic seminar method sucks because you'll have a good point that goes unrecognized, but such is the case in a class with over 100 people.</comment>10/10 Would take again. It is a great course that is huge on the moral deliberation of life and whether or not markets should play a role. You will learn about Bentham, John Stuart Mills, Kant, and Aristotle as the 4 big philosophies that you will consider in this course along with market principles.</comment>Be prepared to share your thoughts. It is important to be wrong at some point in this class, because it is then that you start to question your assumptions, open your mind, and start to learn how to argue. As long as you're open to the ideas of others and can be scrutinizing without being critical, then you will gain a lot from this course.</comment>Don't take it first semester freshman year</comment>A really interesting and insightful course. Really adds a new perspective on what markets should and shouldn't organize. Professor Sandel facilitates the discussions expertly and doesn't attempt to "brainwash" you with his ideas, which I definitely saw as a positive. Maybe not the easiest A, but with only 4 short papers and a take home final also not the toughest course. One of the best courses at Harvard, in my opinion!</comment>Just read his book. Literally every material he covers is in either Justice or What Money Can't Buy; lectures were just listening to unprepared students talking about illogical, unsubstantiated arguments and the grading is way too harsh for a Gen-Ed course. I was so happy to get into the lottery by a big-shot professor like Sandel, but I would say just auditing the course a couple times would be enough to quench the fan-boy desire. Would not recommend.</comment>This class is taught by Michael Sandel. I don't feel like I need to say more.</comment>I was very excited to take this course at the beginning of the semester, but it quickly became repetitive and the conversation was dominated by a few students. I also thought the topics discussed were not as substantive or pressing as many other moral issues that we are struggling with in our society. I also was uncomfortable with many of the comments said in class. Professor Sandel does a great job of creating an open dialogue where people feel free to express their opinions openly and honestly, but I think there were times when people should have been corrected for their insensitivity.</comment>This is more of an extremely large seminar as opposed to a lecture course. You'll get more out of the course if you're willing to take a position on the topics, so don't be afraid of stating your opinion.</comment>Best class I have taken at Harvard. This course will challenge you to have an opinion and take a side on the most controversial issues of our day, because you can't back away from figuring out what's right and wrong just because it might be controversial enough to offend some people. My worldview changed so much, and I learned a ton from Michael Sandel (who is a genuis and a legend, by the way) and from my fellow students taking the class as well. I feel informed about current events and ready to debate with anyone why a particular activity might be morally objectionable.</comment>TAKE IT!!! This class will seriously change the way you think about the world and your impact on it.  The lectures have just the right balance of structure and flow.  Sandel makes sure to hit on all the main arguments, and he spends the rest of the class posing questions to guide students in thoughtful debate.  The papers are fun to write, because you get to pick four topics that interest you and develop an argument about it.  This was the first year it was offered, and it far exceeded my expectations.</comment>A great class with lectures that you will certainly look forward to. My best advice is to learn how to write a philosophical paper as soon as you can. It's very different from normal essay writing, but once you get it down, the class will become a lot less stressful..</comment>This class changes the way you think about right and wrong. I've come to realize that there are many sides to a moral question, there are many pros and cons.</comment>This class is great if you haven't done much moral or political philosophy, or haven't taken a class with Sandel, but if you have done these things, the class gets a bit old.</comment>Grading was unreasonable</comment>This course is repetitive in its themes and is vague in its grading.</comment>DON'T BE SWAYED BY THOSE WHO SAY TAKING A SANDEL COURSE IS A MUST. IT'S NOT. THE COURSE IS LARGELY OVERRATED, GRADING IS ARBITRARY, AND YOUR EVALUATION OF THE COURSE IS LARGELY BASED ON YOUR TF.</comment>Not only will I tell current students that it is the best class at Harvard, but I might tell high school students that the course is a reason to choose Harvard over other schools.</comment>This was the first year the class was offered, so it still has a lot of bugs that need to be worked out.  For example, the essays were largely philosophical essays, and yet we were never taught how to write a philosophical essay.  Having said that, I think that's a bug that will be fixed in the next year or two.  The lectures are fantastic, and I think they're hugely worth the essay frustrations, enough that I would recommend taking this class.</comment>Take this course if you get the chance! Sandel is a fantastic lecturer and the material is so interesting! The readings can be a lot but are mostly really interesting. This course provides a whole new perspective and will change the way that you think about a lot of the world's issues. It leaves a lot of room for discussion and provides a perfect environment for you to learn from your peers.</comment>Take this class. It really affected the depth of my thinking and my awareness about money in society. Professor Sandel is a genius both as a teacher and a thinker, a rare combination, and the chance to take a course with him is one to not pass up. And the topic of this course is fascinating as well.

I didn't take Justice but my impression of it, and having watched a few lectures on YouTube, is that this is an applied way of thinking about that class. Much more interesting perspective than the one three thousand other people have walking around our campus at one time, right? (Or you could just take both...)

Also, advice: go to office hours as much as you can. It is SO FUN and also a very worthwhile way to learn.

Also if you can take this with Tsin Yen as your TF do, she is a fantastic TF!!!</comment>NA</comment>This class is amazing!! Such a gem! It's so interesting and the professor is great. I would take the course again if I could.</comment>One of the best classes I have taken. Strongly recommend. Professor Sandel is amazing and you will learn a lot.</comment>This is an excellent class. The readings and discussion are very interesting, and Professor Sandel is just as engaging and eloquent as you expect him to be. While he has a clear stance on many of the issues, he does not impose any of his personal ideas on the discussion or reading selection. This was the first year this class was taught, but due to the experience of the professor and teaching staff. that was not at all apparent.</comment>This course is incredibly interesting. Topical issues are examined, and you gain the skills to better consider what the role of markets in society should be. Lectures are very interesting, with seminar-like participation and engagement. Definitely a course with big ideas and great discussion.</comment>incredible class, learned so much</comment>Definitely read Sandel's works outside of the class or before it and review the philosophers. Also get writing help through the writing center or a house tutor because YOU WILL NEED IT.</comment>This a great course with a moderate workload. Sandel is definitely as good as advertised and makes lectures incredibly interesting and engaging. The four 1000 word papers proved to be pretty easy once you're able to discuss the topic during lecture. If you like discussing ideas, debating cool moral concepts, or if you are section kid, you will definitely enjoy this course.</comment>The course addresses issues from a lense that is narrow and is therefore sometimes very frustrating. However, it is an interesting way to explore the appropriate use of markets.</comment>This is a course you're going to want to keep talking and thinking about outside of class.</comment>This class is incredible. Some don't always love the extent to which students speak in lecture, but seeing Sandel in this setting is incredible. The class makes you think about issues you previously ignored, and is one of the courses you need to take at Harvard.</comment>Nice and easy course, pretty small size of class makes it easier to participate in the discussion and to meet Sandel during his office hours. Very chilled class, definitely take it if you get picked up on the lottery.</comment>This course is phenomenal. While it may not propound one single view, the material is fascinating, the class is riveting, and of course, Professor Sandel lives up to all expectations. You might not expect it, but his Socratic Method works in every way. Section was truly my favorite hour of every week. If you're interested in ethical reasoning or moral philosophy even in the slightest, then do everything you can to get into this class!</comment>Amazing class. Come in with an open mind and don't be afraid to discuss outside of class.</comment>Michael Sandel holds very engaging lectures, but be ready to write some challenging papers.</comment>This was a great course! Sandel is  a fantastic lecturer and great at actually engaging an entire classroom in debate.  Each case study was interesting and challenged the way that I had previously thought about right and wrong. It was overall phenomenal and also not very challenging or too philosopher heavy.</comment>Professor Sandel is excellent. This is a thought provoking and enjoyable ER class.</comment>Participating in lecture is a lot of people just talking about their feelings. That annoys some people, but I found it to be interesting and made lectures less boring than if Sandel were to just talk the whole time or ask us which reading said what. 

Regardless, Sandel is amazing. Take it! It's definitely not a hard course. Workload is very reasonable.</comment>Be ready for some good discussions</comment>This is probably the best class I have taken at Harvard. It fundamentally changed my outlook on key social, political, and economic issues by providing a framework to evaluate them. Grading is harsh, but definitely worth it in the end.</comment>Its great and very engaging!</comment>It's not an easy gen ed, but it is very interesting.</comment>Sandel is great and the content is kinda interesting but section was really bad</comment>This is a really interesting course, and one that deals with important issues in a really interesting environment.</comment>Awesome course. Although slightly repetitive, great material and lecture discussions. Interesting to hear everyone's very different perspectives on these current and relevant topics.</comment>This was an excellent course.  I'm so glad I lotteried into it.  Sandel is an incredible facilitator, and strikes a good balance of summarizing arguments, laying out dilemmas, and questioning the beliefs of the students he calls on.  The class struck a very good balance of theoretical frameworks and case-based analysis which made for a very satisfying experience, and the assignments were fun to right.  If you have the opportunity, take it.</comment>Very interesting course that changes the way you think about a lot of real-world issues. Introduces many difficult moral issues that I have never considered before.</comment>Basically Justice with another name. Sandell is a good lecturer. Because it's a Gen Ed, the discussions don't get as deep as I would've liked. Other than that it's an alright course. Not particularly incredible, but okay.</comment>Will really make you consider you actions and those of others in a new moral light.</comment>The readings aren't completely necessary because a lot of it is gone over and summarized in lecture and section.</comment>Great class for engaging in important moral debates</comment></course>TAM 101a: Elementary Tamil</title>Engaging teacher, fun class, challenging to learn new alphabet but rewarding</comment>You definitely learn a lot of Tamil in just one semester. Jonathan is very encouraging and engaging, but some of the assignments can get repetitive. I would've preferred more speaking practice rather than mostly learning grammar, but the grammar we did learn was very useful.</comment></course>DRAMA 114: Practical Aesthetics</title>Cool class. Zigler is set in his ways so if you give your opinion, he will definitely have something to say which will most likely refute it. Come with an open mind so you can fully emobdy the tecniques. It's boring when you are not performing for the class, but the class is easy.</comment>The class is super relaxed. Scott is an acting wizard and will help you grow as an actor.</comment>This class is definitely applicable to actors of all levels, and should definitely be considered by people who are interested in directing/writing as well. Very worthwhile course.</comment>It is great for the soul. Do it!</comment>You'll learn more than just how to act better in this course! Scott is always available to you, even if you have questions about a scene you're doing outside of class. His knowledge is just spectacular. If you're not a big actor bear in mind that you have to learn lines, which isn't for everyone.</comment>This class is a gem! I have learnt so much about how to act and more: interpersonal relationships (Scott's witty comments), my own personality/tactics better, perceiving others and overcoming fear etc.</comment>You have to put in the work in order to get up in front of the class and perform, but there is a huge spectrum of preparedness that cannot really be quantified. Hours spent on coursework also depends on when you are performing. If it's an off-week there is less work but the week of performances you have to rehearse a good amount, chose a scene, read the play your scene is from, analyze the scene, etc. And how much time you spend on these things is a personal choice.</comment>When you're not presenting a scene, the class can be quite boring, but Scott gives incredibly helpful constructive criticism, and this class will definitely improve your skills as an actor.</comment>Not a life-changing course, but a solid foundation in the technique of Practical Aesthetics.</comment>This is a great course if you are looking to learn an acting technique. The course is really about learning the technique and everyone definitely makes improvements by the end of the course. It gives you tools to analyze a scene and works a lot with moment to moment work.</comment>Scott is an incredible director. You might think you've gotten a scene or a character figured out, and he can completely debunk your theories and help you discover new meaning in the texts--translating that new meaning into  the portrayal of the character. The course is organized about as well as I can imagine it being, with each person doing three scenes which get reviewed and workshopped multiple times over the course of the semester, though this does mean that in a majority of the classes you won't be doing anything particularly interactive.</comment>Do not take this class if you are not passionate about theater.</comment></course>PSY 2050: History of Psychology: Seminar</title>Read the textbook even though it isn't assigned reading! The professor is great and the topic will be interesting to anyone in the field. I think it would be weird to be awarded a PhD in psychology without this fundamental knowledge of the field.</comment></course>PHIL 117: Medieval Philosophy</title>Try to ask lots of questions instead of just letting things go by without understanding them. Try doing the readings after we go through them in class because they will probably make a lot more sense than if you just try to hack at them on your own.</comment>Prof McDonough is a fun and easygoing teacher, and the readings were very interesting and well motivated. Lectures were helpful in explaining the main themes of the readings. The writing assignments were not stressful. Overall the class was fun and not difficult. My only regret is that it felt difficult to engage with the medievals at a deep level, beyond these broad-brushstroke sketches.</comment>This is a very good introduction to medieval philosophy, but it does require that you be interested in it for it not to be boring. It was well taught, but it's hard to make Aquinas fun!</comment>I came into this course thinking it would be more interesting than it actually turned out to be. Perhaps that is simply because I learned medieval philosophy does not excite me as I thought it did, but the course itself does not seem to be the most thrilling among the philosophy department offerings. You will learn a fair amount especially if you keep up with the readings, and the professor is very nice, but you should seriously consider whether this course really excites you.</comment>McDonough is great! If the class is small. He leads wonderful discussions and makes it easy to discuss philosophy.</comment>This is a really great class. I didn't think I would be interested in the material and came mostly for the teaching, but I ended up becoming pretty enthusiastic about the material too!</comment>Great material to get through. Really gives you a solid base of knowledge to understand modern thought. Just be prepared to change your engagement strategies depending on the different thinkers: for Augustine the readings are imperative, for Aquinas the readings are less important but you will have to think a lot harder.</comment>Do Phil 117. Work with Prof. McDonough. You will not regret it.</comment>Take. This. Class. Prof. McDonough is amazing. 90 minutes fly by.</comment>Fairly easy fly-over of medieval philosophy</comment>This was the last class I had to take as a philosophy concentrator, mostly because I find the medieval stuff to be pretty dry. However, Professor McDonough is one of the best professors in the department, and I love taking his classes. Would recommend taking any class with him, because of his good sense of humor and strength in explaining difficult, seemingly convoluted material.</comment></course>EXPOS 20.258: War Stories</title>If you're interested in literary analysis, the themes of War, good books, war films, or really good discussions, take this course. Maggie's feedback is outstanding and you will learn a great deal about academic writing and argumentation. One warning: if you can't stand pure literary analysis or if writing an essay that requires you to develop a prompt/ analytical question yourself sounds nightmarish, consider other options.</comment>War Stories seeks to impart on the students an understanding of the true depth of warfare spanning a century of our history. Through a study of literature and film it covers a comprehensive list of often ignored aspects of war that affect society, human interaction, and the human psyche. 9/10 would recommend.</comment>The work is interesting and the writing is engaging.</comment>I couldn't have hoped for a better expos class. I was surprised with how much I enjoyed it!</comment>This is a great class where you will really learn about the act of writing.</comment>It's not an easy course, but structured pretty well and covers interesting books. Preceptor is pretty good.</comment>Great choice for expos. Stimulating readings and a solid step by step approach to what we should focus on in our papers.</comment>Though expos is never the best class, War Stories made it the best it could be. Maggie is an engaging and enthusiastic teacher, who really helps you learn a lot about writing. The course material is also interesting.</comment>Dr. Doherty is awesome.</comment>War Stories was a fantastic class -- It made Expos fun! Maggie is a fantastic instructor, the workshops and assignments helped me learn to craft longer arguments, and the workload was less than that of other Expos classes (from what I have heard). There was not much work on writing style, and at times I felt like I was writing for the teacher; choosing my arguments based on what she liked at our draft conferences. However, that seems to be a general trend in Expos courses. The readings in War Stories are also great. Even if you have already read the books, you won't be disappointed!</comment>A great class with interesting reading materials</comment></course>FRSEMR 23m: Nutrition and Public Health</title>Useful information, but a bit boring and not enough work</comment>Don't take it even if you love nutrition and public health.</comment>This course is easy. It is hard to pay attention at times but if you do, you will learn quite a bit</comment>I found it pretty boring and I learned the same thing over and over again.</comment>I felt like I wasted a course slot.</comment>It's a good seminar taught by a creative professor. I would recommend it to anyone who wishes to change the way one lives and eats for the better.</comment>This seminar has completely changed the way I look at food, and have a much clearer understanding about how nutrition and health are related. What you learn here will be applicable daily, something very few other seminars enable to do. Also, Dr. Lo is an incredible teacher, and always open to proposals (like shadowing him in the hospital or going with him to conference outside class). My seminar met during dinner, and it was one of the classes I looked forward the most.</comment></course>SOC-WORLD 30: Moctezuma's Mexico: Then and Now (2012)!</title>The course in general is great and Carrasco is a very impassioned lecturer. The Fash lectures seem a bit out of place though. The sections also were very jumbled and did not get much from them. Grading is also very subjective between TFs.</comment>DO THE READINGSSSSSS.You will be happier for it. You NEED them for the midterm and final. Go to lecture if you feel like it but make sure to do the readings and go to section. Prof. Carrasco is worth going to lecture for...Fash is less engaging unfortunately. You'll learn a lot and you'll enjoy the class more if you put some work in</comment>To do well in this class you have to do the readings, it'll make preparing for the midterm and final much easier. Lectures are interesting, especially when Carrasco is the lecturer. Sections are also fun. Overall it's a great class, it helps if you find the subject interesting. I don't recommend taking this class just because you heard it was easy.</comment>DO NOT take this class if you think it is going to be fairly easy and interesting. Oftentimes it's rather dry, and the grading is pretty brutal. I would not recommend the class. That being said, the TF's are all very nice.</comment>i would not recommend this class, honestly. they graded MUCH more strictly this year (i.e. a B+ was above the median grade on the midterm), and so other gen-eds are better if you are looking not to wreck your gpa.</comment>The subject matter is fascinating, but the professors assign a lot of reading, some of which is never addressed in class as well as a comprehensive group project creating a wikipedia page. It is a lot of work for a Gen Ed, and although you can get by without doing the readings for the most part, they are absolutely necessary for the take home final and midterm. I am not a person who minds work (as a history concentrator, I'm no stranger to a lot of reading and writing) but the expectations for this course don't seem to fit for a Gen Ed or really any course that is taken as just one of four courses taken in a semester. This being said, the lectures are really interesting and the TFs are great, plus during section you get to examine artifacts in the Peabody museum. All in all, it's a really interesting course, but if you take it, be warned that you will be expected to put a lot of work into it.</comment>The reading was a lot but it was interesting in some regards. Some of the lectures were confusing but it was worth it.</comment>This class has a lot of reading materials and requires a lot of time to sift through it all. These readings are crucial to the exam portion of this course.</comment>people say it's easy because there's a minimal work load, but when you do have assignments you have to spend a lot of time on them and they grade harshly</comment>This course requires very little work and you will pick up interesting information along the way</comment>This class is really interesting if you're looking for a introduction to Mesoamerica. I wouldn't take it if you're genuinely not interested in the subject matter because lectures and especially the exams will be tortuous. I loved the lectures Professor Carrasco did, but be prepared to hear points of view that are very different from what you've heard or are used to. I'd say it helps situate some modern struggles that latino communities face today, and contextualizes Mexico's colonial past in a clear way. I wish we had thought about the Encuentro a little more from the Spanish perspective. I would recommend highly

This is a great course that changed my views on colonization and euro-centric cultures. It really showed me how conditioned in this society we are to think in terms of european ideals. It was interesting to look at the ancient mesoamerican world in a historical and archaeological light, while spending time considering questions of transference of native culture to modern Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras.</comment>Good if you've never taken a course on Mesoamerican culture, but it will be repetitive if you're already familiar with the field.</comment>The content of the second half is more CB than SW. You are subjecting yourself to a TF lottery, where some grade insanely and arbitrarily hard and others are more lenient, which is endlessly frustrating.</comment>Interesting coursework</comment>Prior knowledge would be incredibly helpful to be successful.</comment>Easy class, but you'll learn a lot about Mexico, both Pre-Columbian and in modern society. Lectures are sometimes disorganized and seemingly incongruent, and Profe Carrasco's lecturing style is more similar to preaching at times, so just be aware of that. Some tender subjects will be addressed at times, and while it may be uncomfortable its an attempt to foster dialogue. However the class comes with a lot of perks - extra events or lectures with really good Mexican food.</comment>This is a great course, but if you're the most interested in Mesoamerica, it may not be particularly fun for you.</comment>It is not a gem class anymore and the topic isn't very interesting</comment>Ridiculously easy. If you are Hist and Lit, this is not an engaging choice to fill the dreaded pre-colonial lit requirement. If you are taking it for any reason besides wanting to take a ridiculously easy Gen Ed, I do not recommend it. I actually wanted to learn the material and was very frustrated by the lack of engagement / the material / lecture.</comment>not that hard, very interesting, and you learn a lot on a country that has a deep cultural history</comment>great class to take for SOC gen ed</comment>Make sure to go through all of the course material incredibly in deathly before taking any of the exams.</comment>Fun gen-ed.  Being an Ec concentrator, it was a class that wasn't my typical class, and was out of my comfort zone, but I enjoyed it and had fun with it.</comment>This class is pretty interesting and not too painful. The take home exams are fairly long, and there is a lot of reading, but the professors and TFs are all really passionate and want us to enjoy it. It is fun, just try to stay on top of it as much as possible!</comment>This class is no work until you hate yourself for about 24 hours on the midterm, 24 hours on the wikiproject (which is maybe the worst assignment and clearly had zero planning put into it).  Doing this before the final but I imagine I'll hate myself for about 48 hours during that.  Just do something else.</comment>Not as easy as they said it would be.</comment>a gem, but also not really. no weekly work (except reading which you don't need to do), but the take-home exams are hard, and pretty excessive for this course.</comment>This course has a plethora of reading, but can be managed by reading a few of the excerpts each week. If you do the work, you will do well if there is adequate effort put in.</comment>While the content of this course in great, and the professors are engaging in lecture, the experiences for the course overall can be heavily dependent on which Teaching Fellow you end up with.</comment>Easy if you stay on top of the work.</comment>This course, although relatively low in workload, is a bit difficult to follow. Lectures are a little too chaotic and assignments are grades very rigorously, making it hard to be successful.</comment>Gives a whole new perspective to indigenous culture</comment>This class is a fairly interesting and engaging gen-ed, but the assignments can be a bit unclear and what exactly they want us to know can also be unclear.</comment>This class is excellent! If you have any interest at all in weird cultural and religious traditions or Mexico then take this class! The assignments are few and graded easily and section is a breeze. Carrasco is a passionate, awesome lecturer but to be honest going to lecture is not really necessary, as all the info for the take-home exams is in the books, not the lectures. However, you should still go just for Carrasco's awesome lectures! I learned so much about Mexican history and culture that was absolutely fascinating-Take this class, its a gem!</comment>This is definitely a course with a really light workload (only a take home midterm, take home final, and a Wikipedia section project). That being said, the lectures were poorly organized and slides were not helpful. Be sure to vaguely keep up with the readings or it'll be really difficult to catch up for the take homes.</comment>Do the readings</comment>Great course to satisfy Gen Ed requirements. It is especially interesting to those who are interested in learning about the real history of the Americas. The course materials greatly applies to current events and issues, as racism, gender inequality, poverty, and other social/cultural issues that are covered in the class are still present. The course also does a great job at introducing anthropological theory and topics in archeology. Also, Prof. Carrasco is THE MAN. Incredible lecturer!</comment>Difficulty: 3/5. Great class to take as a Gen Ed. Keep up with readings.</comment>It's hard to enjoy the class if you don't have any interest in the materials.  TFs make this class much more enjoyable.  Unfortunately a lot of your grade depends on very few assignments so be sure to stay on top of the material so that those don't catch you off guard.</comment>It's not hard, it takes care of a gen-ed, and maybe you'll learn something.</comment>The class is very poorly structured. There is far too much reading, most of which is irrelevant. Also, the exams are incredibly difficult, and count for an obscene portion of the grade.</comment>Probably the easiest course I have ever taken at Harvard. Like most Gen-Eds, skimming the readings occasionally will suffice, and there is only a take home final and midterm, so very little work involved at all. There is also a group project that took a couple hours max. I was genuinely somewhat interested in the topic, so that made the class pretty fun, but I can see how some people would find it incredibly boring if they had no interest.</comment>Not a mountain of work but it is a very poorly taught class and the lectures are very difficult to follow along with, particularly Fash. His lectures are terribly monotonous and dry. Carrasco is a great lecturer but it's difficult to know what he thinks is important for the course and what he is just throwing out as interesting facts.</comment>I think the material in the course is very interesting and I was glad to have been able to learn about different themes and time periods in Mesoamerican history. You get out of the class what you put into it.</comment>This was probably the most disappointing class I have taken at Harvard. The lectures were boring, and the readings pretty inaccessible. Only take this class if you really want to learn about the softer anthropology of Mexican culture. There was not a lot of history involved, as I had hoped there would be.</comment>Carrasco's a wonderful lecturer despite emphasizing religion a bit too much in the course.  If you get Noa, it'll help balance it out and you should have a solid understanding of Mexico's colonial and pre-colonial religious history.</comment>I took this course for a concentration requirement; had there been another option I would have taken it. Lectures were badly organized and a waste of time, although section was good.</comment>This class was interesting, although it focused more on religion and race than it did on 'societies of the world.' The lectures were interesting, although Carrasco often said things that he didn't justify or explain why he thought what he thought.</comment>it's not as easy as people say... I would only take it if you are genuinely interested in the subject</comment>This course helped to reform most ideas about the Great Encounter between the Old and New world and is very eye-opening. As an anthropology concentrator, I was pleased to learn a great deal anthropology. Professor Carrasco is a passionate, engaging lecture and sections are filled of great discussions and trips to the Peabody Museum.</comment>I found the lectures confusing and unsatisfactory and one of the professors was unfortunately quite monotone and un-engaging.</comment>It's an easy but painful class. Not worth the work unless you actually are interested.</comment>This course is very manageable and introduces you to the Maya and Aztec world all the way to modern day Mexico. The professors are top in their fields and have done numerous primary research on the subject matter. Lectures are very engaging and visiting collections from the Harvard museums is amazing. I should say, if you have no interest in mesoamerica, this course may not be for you.</comment>You really learn to look at the world you live in in a different way. This class helped me gain a better understanding of how Mexico came to be the way it is today.</comment>This is a great class that traces the history of Mexico including discussions on ancient infrastructure and cosmovision, colonialism and racial categorization, and contemporary perceptions of Mexico and its development. There is a good amount of reading but no matter what, always read Carrasco's Religions of Mesoamerica. Midterm and final exams take time so start them as soon as they are released. Manageable and interesting esp. if you are interested in colonialism. Make sure you get Noa as your TF--he's great!</comment></course>GOV 2000: Introduction to Quantitative Methods I</title>Take this class if you want to get a good intro to econometrics class, if you want to fresh up on your intro stats knowledge and / or if you want to learn R. But beware that the workload is way, way, way to high!</comment>Great teacher who can make stats. seem doable and I dare say, fun, even for ppl. with virtually no experience with the subject matter.</comment>This course is difficult if you do not have extensive statistics or quantitative methods background; however Matt is an excellent lecturer and works very hard to tailor the class to the needs of the students.</comment>A decent introduction to regression analysis and coding in R.</comment>Some experience of R is crucial if you don't want to waste 20h/ week coding and debugging in R. Some knowledge of American politics is also recommended.</comment>Some homework assignments are a lot of work, but the course is very applied and excellent for learning the material</comment>Despite some inconveniences such as problem sets, great way to learn R, LaTeX and basic regression in a fairly comfortable environment.</comment>the assignments take a long time...but you will learn A LOT!</comment>great teaching and section work by matt, dana and anton. not sure if the material that the instructors were given to teach in the course was great for a single class, but i would recommend that you take it because you will see this stuff down the road.</comment>This class is a great introduction to linear regression and to empirical work in social sciences more generally. Definitely should be required for everyone doing empirical work.</comment></comment>It's definitely a solid amount of work each week. Remember to start the psets early! Professor Blackwell is a very funny and chill guy. He wants the class to be as good as possible. One of the two TFs was great, the other was pretty awful. Fortunately, I don't think the bad TF will be here next year.</comment></course>AFRAMER 111: Spectral Fictions, Savage Phantasms: Race and Gender in Anti-Racist South African and African American Drama, Fiction and Film</title>This class has very interesting subject material but we didn't really discuss it that much. Solid class!</comment>It will be enjoyable if you do the readings and participate. Otherwise, it can be a bit boring. The work isn't terribly hard, though the grading can be.</comment>Do the reading and participate in lecture.</comment>This course is an excellent way to begin interacting with anti-Apartheid literature, and serves as an excellent grounding to begin discussion of the nature of race relations in two societies fraught with tension. Loved Prof BJ's lectures!</comment></course>JAPNHIST 270: Early Modern Japanese History: Proseminar</title>Early modern Japan enthusiasts will find this useful. For others this course may appear to be a book club. It all depends on the quality and experience of the students enrolled.</comment></course>FRSEMR 44s: Neanderthals and Human Evolutionary Theory</title>You don't have to be interested in HEB to love this course. I felt that it helped me to better understand the world I live in.</comment>Tanya is amazing and the class is an engaging introduction to Human Evolutionary Biology. Though the readings might be dry to some, they're definitely interesting if you take the time to understand them (which isn't too much time for what you get out of them). The seminar met for 2.5 hours a week, but the time really did fly; usually discussion would last 1-1.5 hours and then we would take trips to visit labs, museums, or meet faculty in HEB. The work is not too taxing, and Tanya bought us FOOD (sushi, sandwiches, italian) multiple times throughout the year to *help us focus* on the videos we sometimes watched in class. This was by far my favorite class freshman fall, and you should take it.</comment>The class material is very interesting, especially regarding Neanderthals and human evolution. The work is reasonable and a good introduction to college work, but the best parts of this seminar are the tours and excursions outside of the classroom. I explored places in Harvard I would never have known existed, and for that, this seminar is definitely worth taking!</comment>This class is an interesting and fun way to learn about early humans and especially Neanderthals. The early part of the class, which was focused the development of the theory of evolution, was also surprisingly interesting.</comment>This class was fun. We did a lot of eating (I'm talking Japanese cuisine, Italian cuisine, etc.) in addition to the other work we did in it. On the last day of class we had a Sushi making party.</comment>This course involves reading lots of primary literature on human evolution.  However, the course is a great way to develop skills necessary to higher-level courses such as paper writing and reading of dense literature for meaning.</comment>Start the essay early</comment></course>GERMPHIL 200: Middle High German</title>If you're anything like me, you probably despise 2 hour long classes that meet in the evening once a week 'cause let's be honest, they are usually super boring and awful. This class, however, is nothing like that. You will wish it was three hours long and met twice a week. Racha is a great prof. Always funny and entertaining and extremely knowledgeable about Middle High German language and literature. Excellent course all around.</comment>Fantastic introduction to Middle High German</comment>The new MHG course has been one of the most enjoyable German courses here that I have taken. The material is presented well, and the workload is very agreeable. Assignments feel like accomplishments instead of busywork. The instructor is very cordial and takes and interest in students' progress and changes the teaching style to match the feedback from the class.</comment></course>BIOSTAT 230: Probability Theory and Applications I</title>Only take this course if you have a solid math background.</comment>The exams are challenging, but the course is really interesting. The TAs were a huge help and the professor was as nice as can be.</comment>The course in difficult, very importa and useful, but it is very time demanding.</comment>I had already taken essentially the same class at another institution, but I still found it challenging and interesting. It is a thorough grounding in probability theory. Many of the homework problems from Casella & Berger are not difficult probabilistically, but rather require a lot of calculus "tricks" which are annoying. Our TAs helped us a lot with these. Also I recommend that everyone attend the section/lab meeting since working the practice problems in groups is an excellent way to learn. In fact, I would almost say it is more important to go to the section meetings than the lectures.</comment>Be perfect in your writing and steady in your studies.</comment>It is a good course if you don't have a solid background in probability.  However, if you are a Biostatistics PhD student and have a good background in probability, it is safe to skip this course.</comment></course>ENGLISH Cnfr: Introduction to Creative Nonfiction: Workshop</title>Darcy is amazing. He is such a wonderful teacher and will give you amazing feedback - plus, he's kind and supportive. The workshop environment is truly unique, and you won't experience anything like it in a lecture class. If you're serious about writing, take this. Not only will you improve, but you'll learn how to become a better editor as well.</comment>This class is great if you are looking for a structure to support your writing, and a supportive community that will provide thoughtful feedback. You will write 2 long-form pieces throughout the semester.</comment>Take this class! The workshops will provide a relaxed, non-judgmental early audience for your writing and help you hone your skills over the course of the semester.</comment>Like so many of the creative writing workshops, this was one of my favorite classes this semester. It's very open ended so you have a lot of freedom to write what you want, and the level of engagement I felt from my peers was really amazing. Just the enthusiasm from Darcy and the group made me want to work so much harder on my writing, and I feel that I learned equally as much from reading other people's work as I did having my own work critiqued.</comment>Darcy's great. Don't underestimate how much you'll improve just by reading other people's writing. Be prepared to sit still for three hours.</comment>Although you only workshop two pieces throughout the semester, this class is deceptively time consuming, but incredibly interesting and worthwhile nonetheless.</comment>This class is fantastic. You will learn how to write effectively and how to engage an audience!</comment></course>SOCIOL 98Wb: Race, Poverty, and Justice</title>This course was really great. Because of the small class size, the discussions were always really engaging. It was also a space to talk about really hard to talk about issues. While it isn't always grounded in sociology, the readings were always interesting. Kaia is a great professor who was really good at keeping the course interesting through field trips, guest speakers, free writes and discussions. Itʻs also a really great space to begin developing your ideas about your own personal research interests. I would highly recommend this class. It was my favorite of the semester!</comment>Amazing tutorial. Kaia is such an amazing professor. I really don't have enough words to describe how awesome this class was</comment>Professor Stern is extremely flexible but I wasn't sure what she was looking for when it came to our writing assignments. This course is more about Mass Incarceration and not a broad overview of Race, Poverty and Justice.</comment>A great junior tutorial if you are interested in social justice, race, and class. Made me really reflect on why I study Sociology. Professor Kaia creates a warm supportive class environment and clearly is passionate about the topic and about her students. A great insightful experience. Highly recommend.</comment></course>HIST 2480hf: The Political Economy of Modern Capitalism: Seminar</title>It presents a great opportunity to address lasting and contemporary questions about capitalism with students from varied disciplines and ideological perspectives; it is bound to challenge the language and assumptions that you bring to the study of political economy.</comment></course>VES 158cr: Sensory Ethnography 2</title>It is helpful to come in with some nascent project or set of relationships at a site brewing to hit the ground running and let the class influence your process.</comment></course>PSY 2010: Contemporary Topics in Psychological Research</title>A nice way to become familiar with the department.</comment></course>SPANSH 194: The Borges Machine</title>This course taught me so much about not only Argentine literature, but literature in general. It was an excellent course that taught me how to look at writing in a new light.</comment>If you know and love Borges, you should take this class because Professor Siskind genuinely loves his works and will teach you about them like no one else can. If you've never heard of Borges, you should also take this class because it'll blow your mind.</comment>This class is incredible, Mariano is incredible, the TFs are incredible, the texts are incredible. It's a must-take at Harvard if you are at all interested in literature, theories of knowledge, or translation.</comment>Borges is a wonderful writer, and this class will give you a great overview into his works! Prof. Siskind is passionate about the subject matter, and his enthusiasm really makes the class.</comment>This class is excellent! Prof. Siskind is wonderful. Borges is divine.</comment>Prof Siskind is wonderful. It's a lot of reading, so be prepared for that. It's not a lot of work besides that, and it's generally very interesting reading. I did find myself a little burnt out on Borges by the end, so also be sure you have a decent amount of prior knowledge on Borges and Argentinian history in general.</comment>Great class! Mariano is a great professor and keeps up the enthusiasm throughout the semester. He is also really easy to talk to and connect with, whether about Borges or not. If you're at all interested in learning about Borges, definitely take the class. The workload is very manageable as the class only meets once a week and there isn't a ton of reading. Borges never wrote a novel or anything so you really only read a few short stories or poems per week and discuss them, which is very lax.</comment>This is a phenomenally taught class on Borges. Professor Siskind is obviously passionate about the material and he is extremely friendly and approachable with a great sense of humor. However, Borges is, in my opinion, a fairly dry and repetitive writer. Over the course of the class, I found the short stories were overwhelmingly similar in their style and their "point." If you've already read Borges and you aren't sure you like him, this class is unlikely to change your mind. If you like him or you're unfamiliar, dive right in!</comment>If the thought of taking this class has crossed your mind, you should do it. Mariano is a Borges machine, and the workload is very reasonable even if your Spanish abilities are lacking. Don't hesitate to make use of the flexible language policy (class is only conducted in Spanish per the department).</comment>I think the class was probably one of my favorites this semester and I think I would recommend it to anyone who likes Spanish literature.</comment>If you're curious about Borges's work, would like to read more of it, or would just like to talk about it and have it thoroughly elucidated by Mariano Siskind, take this class. Advanced Spanish skills are necessary insofar as you'd probably want to understand what Prof. Siskind is saying, yet the "flexible language policy" he espouses makes it so that your spoken Spanish doesn't have to be perfect at all. Although lectures and readings are mostly in Spanish, you can speak Spanglish or even outright English if you want. The atmosphere is convivial and sort of cafe-like; you can talk when you want, interrupt lecture with interesting ideas, and bring in outside knowledge if its relevant. Prof. Siskind is a total insider with respect to contemporary Latin American literature—he knows the game and might even set up a Skype meeting in class with a notable Argentine writer like he did this semester. He's also extremely accessible, overwhelmingly knowledgable, and always happy to chat with undergrads. If any of the above sounds enticing, take this class.</comment>SO GREAT. TAKE IT. MIND=BLOWN.</comment>This is an awesome class. The literature of Borges is very challenging in the best possible way. If you like the films of Christopher Nolan or mystery/detective fiction or complex storylines with huge punch lines or fiction described as history, you'll love the material of this class. I highly recommend it.</comment>Mariano is brilliant and hilarious. Good Spanish comprehension is a must, but don't be scared away if you're rusty - I had to look up every other word in the dictionary but the readings are short enough that that was possible. Highly highly recommend.</comment>Borges! Mariano y Jerónimo le dan vida a los textos de Borges. Borges es difícil leer y entender - todo lo que aparece ser es pero al mismo tiempo no es - y entonces es muy padre poder estudiar a Borges con profesores que les encantan sus textos. Tu como lector también le das vida a Borges con tu nueva lectura. Aprendes mucho - como pensar, como escribir, como deducir! Es una clase muy buena. Si te gusta la literatura o el lenguaje español, toma la clase!</comment></course>STAT 140: Design of Experiments</title>I say take it!!! It's so informative! The HW are regular but they are definitely doable with the readings compiled by the professors!</comment>This class is a pretty painless was to learn about design of experiments. The material is applicable and useful, sometimes a little boring. All around the class is a good stat course. If you don't have any experience in R coding, it is tough. Our TF was really helpful with the R code, but it is definitely confusing without that background.</comment>This class is a bit slow (you more or less cover the same basic idea about 8 times as you get into more complex and varying designs) but I think that it is very useful if you plan on applying statistics through experimental design.</comment>relatively easy, somewhat interesting class</comment>it is excellent.</comment>This is a good class to fulfill a Statistics requirement. The workload is not bad (don't be intimidated by the final project it was very easy). However, the class is not organized well and there are not enough materials provided in advance to study for the exams.</comment>Very well taught course!  Comfortable workload.  Final project is interesting.</comment>Great Course!</comment>This course ranks among the most interesting in the statistics department, striking a good balance between mathematical rigor and experimental applications. Professors Dasgupta and Rubin are first-in-class, both personally and pedagogically. 

The course is more similar to 111/139 than to 110/170, but it (in my view) is the most interesting of the five.</comment>If you are interested in understanding reasons for and alternatives to conventional randomized design, this is a wonderful class.</comment>Developing an intuition for how to design experiments is very important, especially if you want to eventually work as a data scientist or statistician in industry. This class might seem monotonous - you'll see a lot of Fisher Randomization tests, and you'll be doing largely the same thing over and over with more complex designs. At first I thought it was redundant, but now I can see its value. I'd love to see more case studies in the class, because it'd be fascinating to see how experimental design has actually affected how companies function and make decisions. I'd say this is a core class for stat concentrators, but perhaps not the most interesting. Very applicable work though, we were always working with data.</comment>The course and material are awesome, but I wish we had covered a lot more. Many times I felt lecture got redundant and we could have moved on to other topics.</comment>Tirthankar is wonderful at teaching. Don is cool but rambles a lot. Peng is the best TF. Take the class if it's offered. It's fun and not too much work and you learn about experimental design from a different perspective.</comment>interesting material... but not a structured class and the psets/midterm was hard</comment>Great class- teaching staff is awesome and problem sets are reasonable. Will definitely help to having previous R experience before taking.</comment>The professors and tf are very willing to help.</comment></course>ENG-SCI 52: The Joy of Electronics - Part 1</title>be prepared to spend ten hours per week in this class between lecture and lab. You will only be looking at about 3 hours outside of it, but then a ton of time on the final project. Avi and David are amazing especially as the semester goes on, and you learn more material.</comment>If you are interested in electrical engineering at all, take this course.</comment>Perfect EE breadth course for MEs.</comment>This is a hands on class with a slightly significant work load. Take it if you're really interested in designing electronic circuits.</comment>I loved ES 52! I had taken ES 50 already, which is a nice overview, but it didn't really give me a strong foundation. I came out of ES 52 with much more confidence in my circuit-designing skills. The labs and project all build on knowledge taught earlier in the course, which helped reinforce the learning.</comment>This was an amazing class!

It is a very large time commitment (8 hrs for lab/lecture plus time for readings and psets) but you get a lot out of it. As long as you put in a decent amount of effort and make sure you never fall behind by going to office hours and such you will learn so much! I was amazed by the projects everyone was able to create by the end especially considering that most of us had no prior circuit experience.

Avi and professor Abrams trade off teaching and are both really great lecturers. Also, both of them are always there for lab and have lots of office hours. During lab, Professor Abrams usually makes me feel like I am in massive amounts of trouble when I ask him questions so I'm a little afraid of him... But honestly he is very nice, just very blunt so try not to let it bother you. Avi is a lot kinder in how he approaches explanations and I always found it a lot easier to talk to him. Both of them are incredibly helpful, put a lot of work into the course and really want to see the students succeed.

My only warning would be cs. They say you don't need any coding background but you actually do. You will need to write some programs in arduino code which is basically C. I took CS50 concurrently and was fine.</comment>If you're a mechanical engineer student trying to fulfill your electronics requirement, I'd recommend this one over Physics 123. I mean this one is pretty time extensive, but the difficulty is pretty fair. Things do get a little hectic around final project time, but it's manageable. In your schedule, this should go down as one of your harder classes.</comment>Interesting course, but can be a big time commitment because of lab. Concepts can be difficult to grasp.</comment>Really fun class, with a focus on the lab portion of the class. The staff really know their stuff, and are incredibly helpful with the labs, and especially the final project. I feel like I definitely learned a lot, but I might not have without already having taken ES50. I don't know how Physics 123 is, but for any EE's, it might be better to take that class instead, since it's supposed to cover more things in greater depth.</comment>I don't think I've ever learned so much practical information in a single course. I went in with the attitude that electronics are magic, and came out with the attitude that I can take on a wide array of design challenges. I feel like I could invent some really cool things if struck with the ideas. Professor Abrams and Avi are extremely helpful if you just take the time to approach them. You may struggle at first (I definitely did), but know that if you put in a bit of effort you can get a lot out of this course.</comment>Take this class if you really want to learn electronics, you need to like the material to enjoy the class. If you want a flashy class thats a fun gened and will give you an easy time take es50. If you like electricity though this class is amazing and will challenge you alot but also expand your knowledge and interest.</comment>This class provides a great foundation for circuitry and electronics. It's very hands-on, and the labs, psets, and exams work well together to ensure that you learn the materials. Great course to take for any engineer.</comment></course>ECON 1936: Keynes</title>Intriguing subject. Passionate professor. Reasonable workload. I really enjoyed the class because it teaches one to question theory. It was great to see an alternative view of economics than what was presented in Ec 10, which made me question a lot of what I was learning. Sometimes, lectures can be extremely challenging and the material difficult to follow, but the readings really help. Overall, I really enjoyed the course.</comment>Great course. If you want to understand macroeconomics, and what are the differences between Keynesian and classical points of view, and you also want to learn some new fresh thoughts and ideas, then you would like the course. I'd recommend it if you economics concentrator. However, this course actually requires at least basic the knowledge of macro- and microeconomics, so if you are not an economics concentrator, and it is your first course in economics, then, probably, it is not a very good idea to take this course. By the way, attend Prof. Marglin's office hours, they are very helpful.</comment>Take this course only if there are no other courses out there that interest you more in Economics. Professor Marglin is a great guy, but is not the best Professor out there. The models you learn are great and all, but not very applicable. Not clear exactly what you need to learn in this course, and is basically just a midterm and a final. Not very useful course, material ok, not extremely interesting, and not great sections. Exams are pretty tough, and can be hard since not clear exactly what you're expected/needed to know.</comment>Take this course! It makes you a much smarter person. Some of the economic common sense that I once took for granted is now questionable in this course. While I still get very confused many times, it taught me how to view the economics from multiple perspectives. Prof Marglin is extremely smart! Spend your time doing the readings. It is definitely worth the time.</comment>Professor Marglin will offer you a completely different view into economics. There truly is no other course that presents as heterodox view to the field of economics as Keynes. You will gain deeper insight into the various schools of economics, and it will certainly change the convictions you have about whichever school of economics you most closely align with.</comment>Take this only if you have a genuine interest in the course. Be prepared to struggle through some very long lectures.  Try to view the course as a whole, rather than individual lectures.</comment>This is a very interesting class; it is applicable and a good theory class. However, it can move very quickly and be quite difficult to understand. The good thing is that that seems to be taken into account in the grading on the exams.</comment>Be very comfortable with the prerequisites, go to office hours, and you'll be fine and find this a really engaging course.</comment>Definitely take this class!  After two years of awful boring ness in EC-10 and 1010, this very different class is a welcome addition to economics at Harvard.  Everyone else in the econ department seems to agree on almost everything, but Marglin shows a very interesting different view.  Don't be scared off by the new models being difficult at first.  Also, Marglin is really nice and is actually a farmer in his spare time and brings apples from his orchard to every class in the fall!  Due to the fact that this course is based on an entirely different set of models from the rest of Harvard's annoying homogenous econ department, this class is pretty difficult at the beginning.  As you get comfortable with this different approach, things become easier. It definitely would be good to have taken EC-10 and maybe (although probably not if you know what you are doing) 1010b before taking this course.  1010a is definitely not necessary.  Also, the tests are fair and if you pay attention in class and go to section, the tests will be fine.  Also, sometimes the 2 hour lectures can be tough and scary, but they are fine after you get used to them.</comment></course>ECON 2530a: International Trade</title>A great broad overview of topics on international trade.</comment>These models come up in a lot of other places (labor, public, macro) so the course may be useful even if you are not planning on international as a field.</comment>It's clear that Helpman cares about the class and has taken the time to organize it well. This is not so for other field courses.</comment></course>OEB 155r: Biology of Insects</title>This course is more work than you might anticipate. Because it packs both an anatomy/physiology course and a taxonomy course into one, it can be a lot outside the classroom. You'll have a lab quiz every week and will have to study up and learn to identify a lot of bugs. That said, making a collection was pretty fun and a very different and wonderful way to learn.</comment>This course was incredible. It was the reason why I am working on insects for my senior thesis. I cannot say enough good things about it. If you have ever been curious about insects, take this course. It was, without a doubt, one of the best courses I have taken at Harvard. Just be prepared, the final project is a ton of work and takes way more time than you would think. Don't worry too much though because the course is designed to let you succeed while still challenging you.</comment>This is a phenomenal class. Be prepared to spend a LOT of time preparing your collection! And do the readings, or the midterm will come as a nasty shock.</comment>Don't take in conjunction with too many classes that require much work outside of class, because you get the most benefit from this class when you have time and energy to dedicate to it.</comment>Catch bugs early!!! Maybe even the summer before. Cannot stress this enough.</comment></course>CHEM 242: Quantum Mechanics for Physical Chemistry</title>Homework could require time. Do not take the course if you think you will not have enough time for the homework and the project. If you think you can handle it it definitely worth it.</comment>This is an introductory quantum mechanics course similar in scope to Physics 143a, though it assumes that you have previously taken a quantum mechanics course (e.g. Chem 160). There is relatively little emphasis on ab initio calculations using Hartree-Fock or DFT methods; these topics were treated in two weeks at the end of the course. If you have a working knowledge of QM and want to learn about these topics, I would recommend reading Szabo & Ostlund (Modern Quantum Chemistry: Introduction to Advanced Electronic Structure Theory) on your own. In particular, if you are a physics undergrad you will find that much of the material is a repeat of Physics 143a.</comment>Make sure you have more than the listed prereqs for quantum.</comment>This class is HORRIFICALLY BAD! Do NOT take it; you'll learn more in an upper-level physics class or any other computational chemistry class. There's a list of reasons: [1] The teaching was either mediocre or a complete waste of time, [2] the resources for learning outside of class were impossible to find, [3] the assignments varied wildly in difficulty (and some had both undergrads and graduate students alike struggling for 5-6 days), [4] the exam was horribly tedious, [5] both question-wording and due dates for assignments and projects were really unclear, [6] the TF (Lucas Kocia) was not helpful or instructive and sometimes even rude and discouraging, [7] grading was unbelievably harsh (simple errors sometimes yielding ZERO points, WITH propagation to subparts of the questions!), and so on. This description doesn't even begin to scratch the surface. If you want to learn something about Hartree-Fock, DFT, and modern chemistry/physics, please do so elsewhere, either through independent study or in another course. If you MUST take it, do yourself the favor of taking it Pass/Fail. You have been warned!</comment></course>GOV 20: Foundations of Comparative Politics</title>Only take this class if you are really interested in comparative politics.</comment>This class is a very good class to take if you are interested at all in Government. It gives you a really good overview of Comp. Politics and you get to listen to Levitsky lecture 2 times a week, which is a real pleasure. It's important to note that the reading for this class is oppressive. It's an unnecessary amount and there is very little chance that you will be able to do all of it every week. It's probably a good idea to get a group together to split the readings or something along those lines. It's a very good class to take if you're at all considering Gov.</comment>You're going to hate this class it's a time drain and you feel like one in a crowd that no one cares about. I learned nothing.</comment>Gov 20 is a great course, mainly because of Levitsky. The material can be a bit dry, so you need to be interested in THEORY of government and politics, not simply the PRACTICE of it, in order to enjoy the class.</comment>A much broader understand of politics and government can be found in Gov 20 if one cares to look, but the gen ed component of the class seems to detract from the quality of the class as actual ideas fall out of the central focus, especially for grading purposes.</comment>Very interesting, but difficult. Levitsky is great.</comment>Government 20 is a terrific foundation course. It includes fascinating materials and Professor Levitsky is an engaging and insightful lecturer. Despite the enormous breadth of the course (covering a dozen or so countries and many broad concepts), it did not sacrifice depth. I find myself recalling many finer points that I learned in lecture or section. A lot of students are unhappy with the readings, but they shouldn't be unmanageable if you work with a small study group. One inherent problem of a big class is that you get little to no individual time with the professor. But Ashley (head TF) is a great TF-- section was organized, productive, and included many interesting discussions and debates.</comment>This class is amazing. Levitsky is a fantastic lecturer, and I looked forward to going to class every day. The readings range from pretty boring to really interesting. There is a TON of reading assigned each week (around 200 pages of dense stuff), but you don't have to do all of it - either get in a reading group and split them up and have each person summarize, or just skim them yourself. Even if you don't get around to all of them, you'll be fine in the course. Of course, the more you do, the more you'll get out of the class, especially section. Section can seem very pointless since you only have 53 minutes to cover hours and hours of readings. I've learned a lot in the course and I think it's a good introduction to governments around the world.</comment>Get ready to read (but its worth it)</comment>Levitsky is an excellent lecturer</comment>Study smart and try and stay committed to doing some of the reading.</comment>While this course has a lot of reading that can at times seem rather pedantic and esoteric, the theories you learn in this class really help you understand why things are the way they are today. It also really helps prepare you for higher level government classes. Overall, this course was really helpful and I'm glad I took it. Plus, Levitsky is a pretty great lecturer and he is able to keep it interesting.</comment>This is the best course I have ever had. Professor Levitsky is the best professor, and his classes are informative, valuable and interesting. If you decide to devote to political science in the future, this course is a must; if you hope to learn knowledge about comparative politics or world politics, this course is also an optimal choice. I highly recommend this course with great enthusiasm.</comment>If you're genuinely curious about the subject, enjoy politics and analysis of various social phenomena (like industrialization, democracy, and ethnic conflict) then you will love this course, as many who take it do. However, if you're not passionate or truely curious about those subjects, this course can be the bane of your existence. Do take it's high Q guide rating with a grain of salt.</comment>The lectures are awesome, and while there is a lot of reading, the class is very manageable. I cannot recommend it enough.</comment>It is fairly difficult but very rewarding and a very good way to get an idea of the government field.</comment>Levistiky is my dude!</comment>Gov 20 is a lot of work. BE PREPARED TO DO A LOT OF WORK. But in the end it really does give you a broader understanding of government, world politics, and the forces that move our societies. How much you learn will largely depend on how thoroughly you do the readings, so be prepared to dedicate a large portion of your time each week reading (or stressing out from being hopelessly behind). I recommend this course, although you'd be better equipped to take it if you're a hardcore student who enjoys reading dense political theory.</comment>This class really does have a lot of readings, but I found them very interesting, so that was not a problem for me.</comment>Gov 20 is fascinating and rewarding, and the reading isn't really as bad as most people say. Sometimes the reading will lag, but Levitsky will pull you right back in with his twice-weekly lectures (unlike some other classes...ahem Ec 10). Take Gov 20!</comment>I'm not a politically-oriented person, so the subject matter of this class was not of great interest to me. The readings were very daunting and unnecessarily excessive, but overall Gov 20 made me look at the world in new and unexpected ways to which I would otherwise be ignorant.</comment>A great class to expand your general knowledge about the world.</comment>Lots of reading...</comment>This course is great! Levitsky is amazing! But, be prepared for a lot of work (especially readings). This is one of those classes everyone should take!</comment>If your are interested in Government at all I highly recommend this class. Levitsky is a great and engaging lecturer. The topic is interesting and teaches you a lot about why world events occur and the theories behing them.</comment>Professor Levitsky is a fantastic lecturer. He is passionate, eloquent, and driven. His lectures are very informative, and offer critical perspectives on a variety of global issues. This class will make you think about the world in terms of government institutions, revolutions, and social conflict. It will give you an informed (albeit limited) perspective on the Middle East, Latin America, Africa, etc. That said, the material is heavy on theory. Dense theory. It is essential to split the readings with a study group, because there is no way to go through it alone. Essays and tests are pretty well aligned with lecture and readings. The one flaw of this course is that, as with many others, the section can make it or break it. I had many friends whose section leaders told them which readings to focus on, how to tackle them etc. My section, however, was barely a review of the general ideas, and didn't really prepare me for the essays or the tests. That said, this is a fantastic course, and I recommend it both as a Gen Ed (a challenging one) and/or as a concentration requirement.</comment>its interesting, but there is a sickening amount of reading... find a study group</comment>This class is interesting, but you absolutely ABSOLUTELY must not fall behind on readings, or else you're wasting your time.</comment>Professor Levitsky is great, he keeps the lectures energetic and interesting</comment>I would strongly recommend that every student take this course. It is a very comprehensive class and the theories discussed are truly enlightening. Definitely take it!</comment>Government 20 is a must for any student hoping to study Government or simply add something exciting to their schedule! Professor Levitsky is one of the best professors on campus, providing entertaining and informative lectures each time. This course is so beneficial and truly expands your views on many current political issues.</comment>Be prepared for the immense amount of reading- the sheer volume expected each week hinders your ability to actively and thoroughly engage most of the works. Otherwise not a bad class at all.</comment>Get ready to do a lot of reading. However, the reading really is not necessary except for the papers. This class will give you a broad introduction to many different topics in comparative politics.</comment>Levitsky is a great lecturer and some TFs can lead great discussion sections, so you'll learn a lot about political theory and interesting, important historical cases. That being said, the essays are a bit tough and the focus on the readings is frustrating.</comment>If you are interested in government you should take it to get a feel for the department though being an introductory course it doesn't reflect most courses offered. It's definitely a heavy work load, but if you are interested in the material you'll enjoy it. If you are not interested in the material, I would look for a different course to fulfill your general education requirement.</comment>This class isn't necessarily for someone who wants to ease into comparative politics, but you walk away much better for having experienced the class and all it has to offer. Your skills in reading, writing, and analyzing deepens as a result of having to synthesize a lot of material.</comment>I think students should take this course if they're looking for an intro to what gov classes are like here. I took Gov 20 as an exploratory course with the hopes that it might be a subject area that I could potentially really enjoy, and I think it really helped me understand what I do and don't like about the subject. Even for those who just want a taste of what comparative politics is like, this is a great course, and I really recommend it, even for non-gov concentrators. It is a lot of reading, but honestly people over-exaggerate how much it is. For many of the weeks the readings are totally doable and didn't take an obscene amount of time like I was told. Students just have to put in the effort, and if you do it's thoroughly rewarding.</comment>You can handle the readings if you read efficiently and learn how to skim!</comment>That the course is an excellent introduction and foundation for Government.</comment>Great class. Engaging lectures. Interesting subject material provided good section discussions.</comment>I would really only recommend this course for those who are thinking about concentrating in Gov. There are a ton of readings. The best way to approach the course would be to form a study group, which may not be ideal for some students. Professor Levitsky is a very passionate lecturer, but it can be overwhelming to try to take good notes during his lectures. This is a very good introduction to some pretty broad political theory, and some of the readings are rather dense. Still, looking at specific cases throughout the world was very interesting.</comment>The material just did not interest me. Levitsky is great, but make sure you like comparative politics. It is not for everyone!</comment>This class is excellent. Don't let the readings discourage you!</comment>This class is as good as it gets when it comes to Freshman government. Levitsky is a rockstar -- I never heard anyone complain about his teaching. He employs a good mix of humor and severity to deal with a complex subject. Sometimes the readings can be dry, but you can get by without reading every single assignment. Regardless of your background, you'll learn a lot from this class.</comment>Levitsky is a great lecturer that knows how to keep his stuff both interesting and enlightening. the reading is brutal so just read the first sentence out of every paragraph or something like that. Speak up in section to make it worth it for you.</comment>Professor Levitksy is a fantastic lecturer and although there is a lot of reading, there are definitely ways to manage it. The class is definitely worth the work you put in.</comment>Put in the work and reap the rewards.</comment>The class has a lot of work, but it is well-worth the time; Levitsky is a really great lecturer.</comment>This class is definitely a really comprehensive introduction to comparative politics. It provides a lot of theories and explanations for understanding phenomenas and events in the world (development, democratization, ethnic conflict, and revolution). I feel like I definitely gained a better perspective of global issues through this course. The only two criticisms that I had were the readings and the sections. Because of the massive amount of readings in the course, it was difficult for many students to keep up. As a result, many students did not do the readings. Unprepared for section, the discussions were shallow and irrelevant.</comment>This class will give you a good understanding of popular thought about why things like economic development, democratization, state collapse, social revolution, and other phenomena relevant to the way our world works have happened. It will make you a more informed citizen of the world, and I would recommend it regardless of what one intends to concentrate in.</comment>GOV20 IS AWESOME.  SO IS LEVITSKY.</comment>Be prepared to do a lot of reading. The good thing about the amount of reading this class assigns is that it teaches you how to read and take notes efficiently. Definitely make a study group, too.</comment>While the readings are extensive, there is much to gain if you put the hours in.</comment>You can go into this class, read little of the material, review section and lecture materials extensively, and probably still do decently (B+ to A- range for sure). But the class may be more meaningful for you (if actually interested in government) if you make the investment in time to actually read the materials. Also, you will definitely become a much better reader and note-taker in the process.</comment>Take it for sure if Levitsky is teaching</comment>Take it if you are concentrating in Government. However, if you are interested in how the world works, it could be very helpful. After taking this class, your perspective around the world completely changes.</comment>This class is a very easy introduction into Government in terms of content; the reading workload is ridiculously heavy and probably cannot be properly conquered without a study group. For an advanced Government student, this course could almost definitely be skipped, but it serves as an appropriate warm-up to further studies within the field. It's a great course to take if you want to increase your awareness about global studies.</comment>Take this class if you want to learn something really useful andinteresting and if you want to listen to Levitsky's awesome lectures. Better not take itn when you don't want to read a lot of sources.</comment>This course was the hardest class that I've had to take, but only because I wanted to learn a lot from it.  I wanted to finish the readings and go to every lecture, which made it difficult to memorize or store a lot of information. Your knowledge is only tested in section, on 2 essays and 2 exams, which is easy to pass through by selectively reading. However, this course has a lot to offer when learning about the world and being familiar with different areas of the world, and the benefits and disadvantages of institutions and regimes that are different from our American ones.</comment>Join a study group right away--it is impossible to read the required course materials all on your own.</comment>This class bombards you with A LOT of information. It can be difficult to keep up at times, but the online lecture videos are useful</comment>This is a very interesting class on comparative politics.  Levitsky is a great lecturer, but try to get a good TF too.</comment>This class requires a good amount of work and a willingness to listen to lectures. If you have no interest in government or politics, this may not be the class for you. I loved it because Levitsky is a great lecturer and the material was very interesting to me.</comment>Take this course if you have the slightest interest at all in comparative politics. Levitsky is one the best lecturers at Harvard, and is an amazing guy. Though readings can be quite long and sometimes repetitive, they are extremely engaging and very interesting. This is made worth it and 100x better by attending lecture and seeing Levitsky talk about some of the most amazing politics around the world, not to mention being able to discuss with the brightest minds at Harvard in section.</comment>If you are interested in comparative politics, definitely take this course. Professor Levitsky is an awesome lecturer and sections are always interesting. Do take into account, however, that there is a lot of reading, but if it is interesting to you it is totally manageable!</comment>Gov 20 is a fantastic introduction to comparative politics!</comment>Levitsky is one of the best lecturers ever. If I had to choose one instance of civil society that I would participate in enthusiastically, it would be the Levitsky Fan Club</comment>You can cram your way through this class or you can work incredibly hard through the class, and what you get out of GOV20 truly is dependent on your work ethic. It's far more theoretical than you might think for a comparative politics class, but if you're willing to really put in the work (and that doesn't necessarily mean doing all of the legendary amount of weekly reading) you'll get a ton out of it.</comment>Standard introductory gov course, you'll probably end up taking it anyway if you're thinking of gov.</comment>Levitsky is an EXTREMELY engaging lecturer and makes every lecture fascinating, even if the subject matter isn't (although it usually is). The amount of reading is borderline impossible to complete if you are also taking other time-consuming classes, but although I'm sure it would contribute greatly to your understanding and enjoyment of the course it's largely unnecessary to complete for the sake of success on the papers and midterm/final.</comment>Great way to get introduced to the government department.  Also a great way to learn more about the ways that the world works outside of the United States.</comment>Take this class! It is extremely interesting, very well organizing and very engaging. It is definitely one of the best classes I have ever taken at Harvard.</comment>It is a lot of reading, but if you do the work the class is rewarding.</comment>While there is a lot of work, it is definitely worth the pain. This is a fantastic class that I really enjoyed and learned a ton from!</comment>Its a good freshmen course to take and a way to see if you might be interested in government</comment>Great class, even as a senior. People really overplay the workload and Levitsky is incredibly reasonable with exams, papers, etc. It's really not very hard, not curved, and people complain too much about the workload. 

Great class, great lectures, great readings. Take it!!!!</comment>Excellant introduction to comparative political science! If you have any interest at all in learning more about international politics and why the world is the way it is, I would highly recommend this course... even if you have zero previous experience in the field. I, personally, knew nothing about comparative politics before this course and both greatly enjoyed it and learned a lot!!</comment>Do as many of the  readings as you can! It will greatly enhance your understanding and appreciation of Levitsky's lectures, which are outstanding.</comment>Although readings may bog you down and the content might be downright confusing, this course really teaches you a lot about various countries around the world and explanations for their current government and societal status, and helps you compare how they transformed throughout history.</comment>Interesting but very difficult</comment>Just beware of and be realistic about the amount of time that you can devote to readings and study groups.</comment>Be prepared for extreme amounts of readings. Not all of it is necessary, so be sure to ask your TF which to focus on.</comment>Professor Levitsky is an amazing lecturer with a clear passion for comparative politics. You will learn about different political theories and various case studies which exemplify them. There is quite a bit of history involved. The assigned reading is enormous but it's not necessary to do all of it; most TFs let their section know which readings are important and which ones to skip.</comment>Gov 20 is a staple that you can do well in while putting in minimal work.</comment>I restructured my whole schedule just so I could take this course. In retrospect, I did really enjoy the class but am less enchanted by it than I was at the beginning of the semester. Lectures are very engaging and worth going to, but readings are long and time-consuming and may sometimes feel unrelated to the subject matter.</comment>It's a lot of reading but cool.</comment>This class is an interesting class. Levitsky is an amazing lecturer. He will keep you engaged and explain anything you misunderstood. Section is just a good place to ensure that you understood everything in the readings and in lecture. However, beware that there are a ton of readings that come along with it. Make sure you allot a certain amount of time each week towards the readings or find a study group.</comment>Professor Levitsky is an excellent lecturer and this class provides a solid foundation on a wide range of topics related to comparative politics.</comment>It's really fascinating and a useful intro into Gov and the Social Sciences in general. You don't need to do the readings, honestly, because if you go to every lecture and take good notes you'll get basically the same out of the course but with less stress (you just might be a bit less clear on who said what when it comes to section).</comment>This is a very good course and I would recommend it to anyone interested in government or more  broadly world issues. It is a demanding course that involves a lot of reading but one that for the most part is worthwhile.</comment>The lectures are great, and it doesn't kill you with work.</comment>Professor Levitsky is one of the best professors I have ever had. His enthusiasm makes the course so fun. The course covers a wide variety of topics, which makes it difficult to follow at times. Professor Levitsky tries to fit an extensive amount of subjects in 1 hour lectures, which causes him to talk very fast and jump from topic to topic and does not leave time for you to evaluate on the information given. Therefore it is vital to review the topics covered in lecture at the end of each day. The reading requirement is too much for the course. It is nearly impossible to do all of them but I encourage you to try. I found myself at a loss before the exam since I hadn't done quite a few. The weekly lunches with Steve Levitsky is perfect to prevent the gap between the students and the professor that is bound to happen in such a large course.</comment>It's a very demanding class but in terms of difficulty it's definitely doable; more than any other course I've taken this term, I think you really get out of it what you put into it. I wasn't really planning on taking this class but did because Prof. Levitsky's going on sabbatical next year, and I'm so glad I did. I think it really opened my eyes to not just the facts but also the whys and hows of history and current events.</comment>This class is amazing. Professor Levitsky is an amazing lecturer, so make sure you take it with him. There is a lot of reading, but it is well worth the time to do it because you learn so much.</comment>Good if you don't know much at all about international politics.</comment>Make a study group, but make sure to do the readings yourself as well. Keep up with the readings weekly.</comment>I seriously wish every single person in the world could take Gov 20, because I think its lessons both teach students a lot about the world, and serve to help students understand why having an enlightened sense of self-interest is important. If every person in the world took Gov 20, there would be a lot less global conflict. Because that's obviously not realistic, every single *Harvard student* ought to take this class at some point. It was amazing.</comment>This class is amazing and will change the way you look at the world. You get to engage with fascinating material and learn about a variety of political theories. You'll cover so much in this class. Levitsky is a fantastic lecturer and his lectures cover a ton of information, and they are also very enjoyable to listen to. Section tends to foster stimulating conversation, and the written assignments are very open-ended and enjoyable to write.</comment>Highly recommend for Freshmen, but not so much for upperclassmen as much.</comment>This course is tough, but it's rewarding. If you don't do the readings, this course will be useless (and most likely harder than it needs to be). As long as you do the readings and put it upon yourself to engage the topic, you'll be in great shape.</comment>Take it!!!!!!!!!!</comment>There is a ton of reading but it is worth it to at the very least ATTEMPT to do it all because it will improve your experience in lectures and in section.</comment>This is a great class and Levtisky is one of the best professors you will find here. Lectures are engaging and interesting. Be sure to do the readings because they make section much more interesting and you take more away form the course.</comment>Amazing intro to Gov class</comment>The lectures and readings for this course will make you a better informed citizen of the world.  The class is extremely and engaging and relevant.  However, the assignments can be frustratingly vague and many fellow students don't really take the course seriously.</comment>If you have even the slightest interest in any sort of politics, then taking this course is an absolutely fantastic way to satisfy that interest for a semester.</comment>It's an interesting course, Levitsky is a great lecturer, but the reading can be overwhelming. Don't try to do it all alone. Honestly not doing any of it is viable if you have a good section and go to all the lectures. It's also a good intro to government, so if you might major in gov it's a really good class to take.</comment>Great class, but it takes time to learn how to manage the class. Make a study group and meet regularly.</comment>This is a good litmus test for whether or not you want to study government. There is a lot of reading, but it is doable.</comment>This is a great course, you will learn a ton. Professor Levitsky is an amazing lecturer as well. Be prepared for a lot of reading – I thought most of it was really interesting, but it would probably be a huge drag if you were not all that interested in political theory. But if you are interested in Government and how it works, this is definitely the course to take!</comment>Levitsky is a great lecturer, but don't let that make you take the class, as he teaches other courses and, given that each lecture is posted online at a saner hour, there's not much incentive to go to class. Readings are heavy but manageable. Section will be nightmarish because you either didn't do all of the readings or you did and have to sit around waiting to be called on.</comment>This class has a reputation for assigning an insane amount of reading, but the tests only expect you to know the content on a very superficial level. You don't need to do all the reading--just know one or two units in greater depth for the essays. But the reading, even if you only do a quarter half of it, is incredibly rewarding.</comment>An ability to read analytically and to take notes is very helpful for this course. You don't have to do all the readings, and you certainly don't have to do them all yourself. Create a study group and break up the readings. Make sure each member notes the main idea/thesis of each reading, along with the dependent/independent variable involved, as well as the causal mechanism.</comment>Great course. Levitsky is a great lecturer. A lot of reading, but a lot of it is covered in lecture and section so it is not overwhelming. Highly recommend.</comment>Professor Levitsky delivers each and every lecture enthusiastically and it really is fascinating to hear him each week. He explains political theories in a concise, clear way and really tries to make himself accessible to the students.</comment>it is a lot of work, but in the end it is an extremely rewarding class! Levitsky is an amazing lecturer, and you will walk away with such an expansive breadth of knowledge of political trends and developments around the world.</comment>Although there is a lot of reading don't let this deter you. The lectures are well prepared and Professor Levitsky is very easy to listen to. Often the readings just support the lecture material so as long as you are engaged in lecture/section you will be fine.</comment>Gov 20 is a fascinating and important class because it exposes you to so many interesting new ideas - not only new answers but also new questions. Prof. Levitsky is terrific, my TF was also great, and the grading is fair even if the workload is pretty heavy. The course also exposes you to some intersectional disciplines like ec and sociology and provides a strong base in essay-writing, college-level discussion, and analysis/critical thinking. If you have room in your schedule for a rewarding but reading-intensive class and are interested in gov/politics (don't have to be interested in IR - I'm not), take Gov 20!</comment>So much reading. Around 200 pages of dense reading a week. Recommended for people with a strong interest in the material and will put in time to actually read because the readings lose value when summarized.</comment>If you're interested in Gov, then this class might be good for you. However, the amount of work required was way too much for someone like me who has a shallow understanding and interest in government. I would\t really recommend taking it. Plus, Professor Levitsky literally just reads out his typed up notes in lecture -- not too engaging for me.</comment>The readings are manageable, once you're not a freshman anymore. If you go to lectures, you only need to flip through them before your section (just don't get one like I did immediately after second lecture).</comment>Gov 20 has fascinating topic material. I was really interested in the issues that we discussed and I learnt a great deal. However, I did not feel particularly engaged with the course as a whole. The course is so reading based which becomes tedious and it is hard to motivate oneself to do it. The essays are completely based on the reading as well. As a result, they feel mildly formulaic in that little creativity or independent though is necessary. In fact I was told by my TF that bringing in lots of ideas from outside of class was discouraged. Overall this made me feel mildly dissatisfied.</comment>There is a lot of reading to do, but it's rewarding to see the full picture of what the course is trying to convey.</comment>There's a lot of reading and if the subject isn't interesting to you perhaps don't take it, but speaking personally it was transformative and really changed the way I think about the world. Worth the excessive reading.</comment>This course gives a great introduction to one of the pathways you can pursue in a government degree or offers an interesting perspective to fulfill the Societies of the World Gen Ed. This class has a lot of reading, so when enrolling, know that you will be spending a notable number of hours reading. Lectures and sections are very interesting and engaging, so it's important to keep on schedule with your readings or you'll find your reading list bulking up, especially around essay and exam weeks.</comment>If you're going to try to do all the readings, you're gonna have a bad time. He covers the important stuff in lecture anyway so don't bother.</comment>I think this class is an excellent way to start to figure out if you really want to concentrate in government. The way I see it, this is pretty interesting material taught by an incredible professor, so if you do not like this class gov might not be for you. The reading is almost absurd, there wasn't a single week that I finished all the reading confidently and completely. Overall, a great class if gov is your thing, pretty miserable if it is not.</comment>Professor Levitsky's impassioned lectures and the interesting course material make this a must-take class for anyone vaguely interested in politics. There is certainly a lot of reading, but if you form a study group and keep up with the readings you'll be fine. It's worth it!</comment>This class succeeds in being engaging and informative in incredibly useful ways; I feel like a much more well informed citizen, student, and gov concentrator after taking it.  An interest in politics from more than a social point of view is definitely an asset.

Lectures are so engaging; Levitsky is the best.  I highly recommend you seek him out after class, whether through lunches with Levitsky or through his office hours.
Because primarily freshman take this class, TFs are particularly helpful on essays and holding large "how to study for gov" and "how to write for gov" sessions.  Rakeen is an especially fabulous TF, so well spoken, knowledgable, and helpful, so you're in for a treat if you get her.</comment>Going to lecture is worth it regardless of the hour</comment>Steve Levitsky is a great lecturer, but there is a lot of reading for the class</comment>This is a great class! Lecture is engaging and while there is a lot of reading, most of it is interesting and relevant to class discussion.</comment>You might not like how evaluations work, but the material itself is undeniably interesting and very useful for informed citizen in a global society.</comment>I would tell students that the class is really interesting, but they should not take it amidst too many other high-workload classes as it is very demanding.</comment>Readings can be monotonous but the things you learn are fantastic!</comment>Incredibly important to establish an effective study group right away. Keep up with readings. The course can provide an incredibly valuable background in world events and politics, but success in the exams and essays requires that students pace themselves throughout the course or risk burning out.</comment>Great course with fascinating materials and a great teacher. It has too many readings though for an introductory course. It'll be a great experience. Not an easy A but very transformative in shaping the way you look at the world.</comment>This class is truly fantastic because of the strength of the teaching team, headed by Professor Levitksy, and the rich content of the material. Professor Levitsky is one of the few professors I have met at Harvard who really invests in teaching. His commitment to the students is clear through his engaging lectures and his lunch with undergraduates every other week. Even though the class is so big, he makes himself really available and gives students a chance to get to know him and talk to him about the material personally. He's just an amazing teacher that can get anyone excited about this subject matter. At the same time, the range of relevant issues we cover in class, from the Iranian revolution to the Rwandan genocide, have made clear to me how to relate the many theories I learn in class to real-life events. Truth be told, this class is challenging because of the amount of reading that we are suppose to do every week. Sure, you can get by without doing all of it...but this is definitely one of those classes in which the more you put into it, the more you get out of it. This not only applies to readings but to office hours. As I said, Professor Levitsky has a lot of office hours and I would encourage any student to go! Gov20 is one of those Harvard classes that embodies what college education should be: an opportunity to learn about academic theories that very much apply to the real world with an awe-inspiring professor and knowledgeable and helpful TFs.</comment>This course was a great introduction to comparative politics, regardless of whether you intend to continue in that field. Levitsky is a great lecturer, and he has chosen readings specifically to give a good sampling of the world of comparative politics.</comment>Not interesting material</comment>This course has A LOT of reading. However, if you find a good reading group, you can cut it down to 3-4 hours of reading a week. Not all the reading is necessary, and you can get a good grade without doing it all. The class teaches you a lot about other cultures and is great as an intro course for someone interested in government or just as a course to get you thinking about politics in other countries.</comment>There is an insane amount of reading in this class, so just be aware of that as you choose your classes. Professor Levitsky is an awesome lecturer. Also, have some experience with writing 5-7 papers because minimal help will be given to you. Expectations are unclear, grading is subjective, and very ambiguous advice is given.</comment>Honestly, it may be time consuming, but the course is well worth it. Steven Levitsky is a fantastic professor, and the material is very interesting. By tying in the material to case studies, and sometime current events, Levitsky makes the class engaging and practical. It doesn't feel like we're just learning theory. Overall, I really enjoy it, and would recommend it to anyone interested in culture and political or social development.</comment>There's a ton of reading. Honestly, the class doesn't really require that all the reading be done (Professor Levitsky does a fantastic job covering all the ideas in lecture), but the reading that is requested is really well chosen, so much so that it's a shame that I had to skim it.</comment>I never liked the idea of government until I took this class. This is an amazing class that will teach you a lot about how the world works, and I would highly recommend it to anyone!! Even if you don't think it is your thing, you can find methods to help you think critically about theories in politics, development, and conflict.</comment>I loved this class. Levitsky is amazing and Rakeen was an awesome TF. You have to do the readings to do well, but they're generally pretty interesting.</comment>Go to Office Hours-The TFs are amazing, friendly, and really helpful</comment>Don't take the course for fun, but do take the course if you want to get better. The course will push you, but not crush you. Also, you will learn about comparitive politics, so that is always a plus.</comment>GREAT Professor. I learned more than I could have ever imagined in this course. It was a great way to start my freshman year!</comment>Good class, gives a broad base for understanding different political theories but there are way too many readings.</comment>Definitely take this class if you are interested in government, whether as a concentration/secondary or just as an outside interest.</comment>Definitely take this course, I learned a great deal! Be weary of the amount of reading and the forceful.competitive conversations in section (lots of future politicians or international relations pros)</comment>The reading is hard but worth it. It is all very intriguing and I wish I read more.</comment>Its a great class but it is hard work.</comment>take it to learn about how others organize their governments</comment>Gov 20 will introduce you to a lot of material and not make you work particularly hard to make sense of it all except on two papers that are not worth very much of your ultimate grade. Levitsky is an excellent lecturer, and the fact that lectures are posted online and can be sped up with the "CS50 2x" plug-in makes the lecture component of this course its clear strong point.</comment>Definitely form a reading group to split up and discuss the readings with.</comment>It's a great class, but you have to have a good reading ethnic as section leaders or the professor hold you accountable for the reading.</comment>DO NOT TAKE IT IF YOU'RE NOT A FRESHMAN</comment>There is A LOT of reading for this course. You can get away with not doing it for section but it gets really hard to catch up and cram for exam times. But it is easy to write your essays without doing the reading. Just be weary of how much time the reading is going to eat up.</comment>Levitsky is a wonderful professor, and his knowledge of government and politics is awesome. However, I feel that this course is too literature-heavy and would benefit much more from a 2 hour section that discusses important theories and provides opportunity for debate and opinions.</comment>It's interesting if you're willing to do the readings</comment>Although it's very dense, the course is very interesting and fun.</comment>Professor Levitsky gives great lectures, but the section component is hit or miss. Do NOT do all the readings...join a reading group and share study guides.</comment>stay on top of the readings as much as possible, but don't get bogged down if you fall behind. levitsky is as amazing as they say.</comment></course>MUSIC 51a: Theory Ia</title>It's a lot of fun. There are a lot of components of the class to keep track of, but it's very very manageable. A very enjoyable way to fill the AIU requirement AND learn a lot about music theory. Beaudoin's lectures were very interesting.</comment>This is an excellent class in all respects</comment>Music 51a is a great class to take if you're looking to learn more about the technical aspects of music. You learn about basic concepts which you can apply when listening to or writing music. It's great if you want to learn how to better appreciate music and/or want to further your understanding of music theory. Beaudoin is a great professor.</comment>This is a great course that will deepen your appreciation of music and improve your ability to compose</comment>All the teachers of this class are incredible, and they really make the class an incredible experience. Theory sounds dry, but with Beaudoin it is not at all; class is really fun, and the TFs are great. All the assignments are really fair and doable, even if they seem overwhelming at first, and your TFs will help you along the way. I would absolutely take this class.</comment>You can take this class without any formal theory background AND without being a pianist. I did, and had a really fantastic time. I had never done things like Roman numeral analysis before, and while I was definitely behind my classmates at times it was never that big of a deal. The teaching staff did a great job making sure everyone was up to speed, so as long as you have played a reasonable amount of music--be it singing, piano, violin, guitar, whatever your thing is--you'll be fine and probably have a great time in this class. I really had a ton of fun.

Also worth noting that the keyboard section really isn't anything to lose sleep over if you're a non-pianist; it's a pretty laid-back addition to the course that doesn't demand a lot of you.</comment>Even if you know a lot about music theory already, take it. Even if it's just to see Beaudoin's fabulous lectures. Overall the class experience was amazing. A few things that struck me in particular:

The mount of individual attention you will get is stunning. The teaching staff will care about what you do, and provides multiple weekly individual meetings.

The assignments are well thought out, and you will get a very enriching experience out of completing each one. Analysis papers, compositions, harmonic analyses... all provided different ways of finding personal growth within the realm of music.

Lectures are stellar. They are clear, structured, engaging. I've sat through a pretty big amount of music lessons before, and close to none were as well prepared as these. 

Beaudoin is a composer, and will emphasize the creative and sensitive side of your musical education, which I find the to be the best way of teaching music.

This is also just an excellent way to become part of the music department community at Harvard which is quite small and tightly knit. 

In case the comments above aren't clear enough: if you are interested in music, this is a course of rarely met quality that you should certainly take.</comment>This class is incredible. Music is very fun, and this class makes it all the more fun. Understanding line, tonal harmony, and rhythm is a good basis for understanding a lot about music, and not just classical music. Professor Beaudoin and the teaching staff are really caring, and enthusiastic about teaching. Professor Beaudoin emails pretty much every week saying he's willing to help with assignments, and apparently he looked at people's compositions over Thanksgiving break. While lecture is 2 hours long, it hardly feels like any time at all.  On that note, I will point out that this class is a time commitment (in addition to 2 hour lecture, there's section, ear training section, and keyboard lessons). However, it's a blast, and completely worth it.</comment>This is a great class- an absolute must if you are a musician! Beaudoin is one of the best lecturers I've encountered, and I truly looked forward to each class. Keyboard section is a little dull/arbitrary, especially if you're a pianist, but I definitely walked away from this course with a new perspective on all types of music- not just classical!</comment>Professor Beaudoin is an amazing lecturer and teacher. Even though most of the music studied is classical with an emphasis on Bach, Prof. Beaudoin does a good job of using contemporary musical examples and relates what you learn to current music.</comment>To me, this course was rather unremarkable. It didn't make me cringe due to major organizational problems or terrible assignments, but while the material was somewhat interesting and the course reasonably good, it wasn't memorable and didn't push my music or my thinking ability as much as it could have. It does fulfill the AIU GenEd painlessly for musicians and gives a decent introduction to music, but those who have played an instrument for a long time will likely be uninterested in the material.</comment>Professor Beaudoin is an engaging lecturer. Take time to see him in office hours... he gives great feedback. Also, don't stress yourself over the readings. Don't ignore them, but don't dwell on small details.</comment>Don't underestimate the amount of time this class requires.</comment>Beaudoin is truly an incredible professor, and this class is phenomenal. You will learn a ton and have a blast.</comment>I would definitely encourage students to take this course!  It is engaging, creative, and very enlightening.  As a student who has taken an AP Music Theory course though, it was a fair amount of review though.  I would definitely give a high amount of praise to Professor Beaudoin for nonetheless bringing a fresh perspective to the material every class, and the way he goes about structure each lecture is very thoughtful and clearly organized.</comment>Professor Beaudoin is delightful.</comment>This is an amazing class. It is extremely well-organized and balanced. Every assignment is interesting, varied, and requires critical thinking. The sections are very small (around five people) and the TFs are outstanding and give detailed and timely feedback. Professor Beaudoin gives wonderful lectures and is almost always available to meet students during office hours.

I came into this class never having taken a formal music theory class before, and I thought it would be extremely difficult to keep up. However, you do NOT need a previous background in theory to do really well in this class, though experience with reading and writing music or playing an instrument is essential, as well as having a passion for music. If you make it through the placement exam and are recommended for this class, sign up without hesitation (despite any misgivings about the placement exam). You will not regret it.</comment>I had only heard good things about Music 51a and it did not disappoint. Professor Beaudoin is amazing. Every week I felt as if his lectures lead the way to a whole different world with green grass, clear blue sky (and perhaps a lemon tree because why not). Assignments, section and keyboard are excellent as well.</comment>Make sure you already have a good understanding of basic music and music theory concepts.</comment>Professor Beaudoin is an amazing professor, who is enthusiastic about what he does. This makes each lecture interesting and informative. I had almost now prior music theory background, so I struggled a lot with this course. However, I'm really happy I took it, and with the help of the professor, TFs, and classmates, I learned a lot and am moving on to take the next part of the course.</comment>If you have some background in music theory and are at all interested in learning more, then take this course. Professor Beaudoin is fantastic, and you'll solidify what you've learned previously and learn some cool new concepts. All of the sections can get a bit annoying, but the assignments are great (not too time-consuming). Definitely take this class!</comment>This course is a lot of work, but you definitely learn from it and gain a greater appreciation for music in general.</comment>Really fantastic course! You learn so much, and it's all really fun! it seems like quite a time commitment because of the three sections (1 hr weekly normal section, 30 min weekly keyboard section, 10 min weekly musicianship section) but they're all really enjoyable so I didn't mind at all! The teaching staff is wonderful--Prof. Beaudoin is one of my favorite professors I've had at Harvard! Olivia was also a really fantastic TF, but unfortunately I think she's leaving. I'd HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who wants to use it for a music secondary, A&I, or even just an elective!!</comment>Professor Beaudoin is absolutely amazing. He fills the room with energy while teaching and makes difficult theory concepts easy to understand. If you're interested in music, take this course! In terms of being ready to take it, I think there are two options for preparation for this course:
a) Have prior music theory knowledge: If you've taken AP Music Theory in high school, you should breeze through the foundational parts of the class, which will make it easier for you than it was for me.
b) Be very interested in music: If, like me, you don't have any theory background, don't worry! I'm a singer (4 years of choir) that loves music, but had never studied it in an academic setting before, and while the first few weeks went slightly over my head, I was soon easily understanding all the material. If the term "Roman numeral analysis" scares you, trust me: it really isn't too bad.
If, however, you just want to explore music and you haven't really done so before, I might advise taking a lower level intro to music class, since this class assumes some degree of knowledge of very basic concepts in music.</comment>Totally worthwhile if you're even thinking about taking this course!</comment>Many people said this felt like two classes. There are just so many assignments. A foundation in Western music training was pretty crucial. That being said, it certainly teaches you a lot about harmony and musicianship. Take it, just expect to devote a lot of time to it!</comment>Great class!  The lectures were very interesting and the assignments were very fun.</comment></course>FRSEMR 44g: Public Policy Approaches to Global Climate Change</title>If coming in as a freshman you already know that you are interested in climate change and the way public policy correlates to this, taking this class with Professor Cooper would be the best call. He will be able to introduce you to a variety of authors and areas of research as well as his personal experience of working with the government and advising various committees.</comment>If you lack a strong interest in environmental public policy, you will probably not enjoy the course. Since it is entirely lecture based, there is the risk that the material is boring if you do not find it relevant.</comment>Great way to admire the knowledge of professors.</comment>This seminar is not very engaging, and it's very easy to fall asleep to Prof Cooper's soft monotonous lecturing voice. Beyond that, the course is really easy and if you're looking for a class to take freshman fall because you're taking a heavy course load, then this is an alright option.</comment></course>ASTRON 201a: Stellar Astrophysics</title>Good for stars from a theory perspective. Not too much connection to observations. The larger context felt lost sometimes, but still a good course.</comment>Take this course if you are after a holistic and theoretical understanding of a variety of fundamental topics in stellar astrophysics. The coursework is reasonable in quantity and difficulty. You can really learn a lot about a particular topic from the project, too.</comment></course>CLASARCH 100: Greek Antiquity</title>This is a great class to take, whether you have had experience in Greek archaeology or not! Professor Stähli is a great lecturer and he really knows so much about all the material. Recommend for Classics concentrators or not, everyone will learn something new.</comment>Take it!</comment>One of the best classes I've taken at Harvard. Take it for the professor - Professor Staehli is wonderful! Keep up with the readings because they are helpful, and go to class because it's always interesting.</comment>Very fun and interesting course on Greek art and architecture; the professor is engaged and is clearly more concerned with how much you are learning than how to test you or grade you. I would highly recommend</comment>For anyone seeking to receive a strong foundation in ancient Greek material culture, this class is a wonderful opportunity. Furthermore, this class offers a very nice introduction to the field of classical archaeology.</comment>Take this class--Professor Staehli is the best!</comment>This is a really fun and interesting class. The quizzes are nothing too stressful, and Professor Staehli is a very fair professor and a good lecturer. All in all, a gem of a class.</comment></course>AFRAMER 141x: Prejudice and Racism in Modern Society</title>This course is phenomenal in theory, but fails miserably in execution. Unfortunately we had grad students in the course who completely understood the material, and in the end dominated conversation. The defense and prosecution set up seems interesting, however all of the time is spent talking about the study design. We spent every class period (2hrs a week) discussing study design methods and whether or not the studies we read were preformed in a valid way We barely touched on racism, the implications of the theories and studies presented, or any interesting material pertaining to race. Students would occasionally bring the discussion to race, creating interesting discussion, but it would always be redirected to critiquing study design. Sidanius is an amazing professor and every time he talked (very rarely) I loved the course. Good professor, bad course. Would not recommend.</comment>This class has the potential to be really interesting because of the subject matter but it did not work. It was no structure in the class. The professor while brilliant independently, did not help in this. He treated the class like grad students even though there were only 2 grad students in the class. The final 30 page paper was killer and we also had little instruction from the professor.</comment>TAKE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</comment>The readings and discussions will push you to think about prejudice and racism in ways you probably would not have.</comment>If you're very into the psychology of intergroup relations, take this course. If not, I'd suggest looking for something else. Professor Sidanius is super smart but doesn't give feedback at all throughout the semester, so be prepared to not know how you're doing grade-wise. The final paper can be a cool experience to explore a topic of your own interest though (although there's no prompt/guidelines, so it could also be stressful).</comment></course>STAT 139: Statistical Sleuthing Through Linear Models</title>Sometimes a bit dull, but overall this class covers very useful material.</comment>This course was yet another stat course that made me wish I hadn't concentrated in statistics. I don't really think I learned anything that I didn't already know from 104 and 111, but it still managed to be somehow difficult. Also, WHY IS THERE A PROJECT AND AN EXAM. No, just no.</comment>An useful class to take, especially for people who are interested in doing research or writing thesis. Some departments don't take statistics and methods seriously, even though research is a big component of their works. So if you are just looking for a class that is not too difficult and useful, this is the one.</comment>This class was an excessive amount of work and it was difficult to really get an understanding of the material through lectures. Although useful topics were covered, the material was presented such that it wasn't easy to make connections or to understand the bigger picture. The subject might be better depending on the professor, but I would not recommend the class as I took it.</comment>This course is useful but I would not take it if Liubliuska is teaching it. She is really nice but just do not take the class if she is teaching it.</comment>It's not difficult if you are a stat concentrator who has taken 110/111, but it's annoying.  Section is unorganized so you're better off using the textbook and google to help get through the psets.  The project had absolutely no guidance, and there's a final too which is annoying. They write the tests too long so be sure you skip ahead and do the easy parts to get points</comment>Fairly straightforward linear models class. I recommend that you take it if you're interested in doing any kind of applied statistics / research involving the use of statistics because the techniques you learn pop up ALL THE TIME (ANOVA, linear regression, t-test, etc). You want to be a knowledgeable user of these techniques. You want to check the assumptions behind these techniques and know how to interpret the results without spin. This class teaches you how to do all of that and I think if you pay attention you will be prepared to do actual research applications with statistics. 

A word of warning: The psets can be really tedious. They seemed like busy work sometimes. Just be aware of this before you take the class. Also, having a final project and a final exam meant a lot of work during reading period. I hope the course staff considers less tedious psets next time.</comment>The class can be tiresome at times, you go through all of the material you cover in Stat 104, but with greater depth.  You should have some prior knowledge of different distributions before you take it, but definitely not a deal breaker if you're shaky on the notation and the characteristics.  The tests are fair, and generally not too difficult.</comment>This course teaches you some very applicable skills, but a lot of material will be repeated from Stat 111. Overall, dry but useful.</comment>This course will give you a very practical foundation off which to build for data inference. Be patient—the first couple weeks of the course are not fascinating—and then you will be rewarded, as the back half, when you learn a variety of very interesting regression techniques.</comment>Good material in there, but this is definitely not the best class out there that teaches it.</comment>Linear models is def an important topic. The class was just kind of boring. Doesn't really make you excited to be a stats concentrator</comment>This course is the quintessential example of how the whole is not equal to its parts; the individual concepts discussed in class, the intentions of the professor, and even course logistics all have a good intention behind them, but put together, they yield a course that tries to be everything but ends up being very little. Yes, videotaping lectures is helpful and cool, but not when clicker questions still require everyone to come to class. Yes, final projects are cool, but not when the course also has a final project and a midterm! The list goes on and on. 

Course book: Written both like a reference manual, and in a horrible style. Utterly void of mathematical proofs or rigor, and full of useless "case studies" which crowd out all the technical details. By taking out duplicate content, the entire book of the course could be distilled into a couple of Latex handouts. 

Lecture slides borderline illegible -- at best, they regurgitate theorems and results verbatim from the book, at their worst they are a messy blob of arithmetic completely unintelligible to anyone looking at them later. 

Problem sets are extremely tedious, taking up upwards of 12 hours apiece, yet filled with either meaningless exercises (think t-tests done by hand over and over again) or meaningful problems, whose true value, however, never becomes apparent to the student due to poor wording of problems, and the reasons why they are assigned in the first place. Grading is harsh and inconsistent. 

The format and difficulty of exams was communicated unclearly, and the practice exams were both shorter and way easier than the actual exam. Be sure to study a lot for both the midterm and the final. 

Stat 111 and 110 should definitely be prerequisites, as should R programming skills. Frequent references were made to concepts not taught in the introductory level courses like Stat 104, even though it was the only listed prerequisite. R skills were assumed rather than taught, so the R component of Stat 111 would be helpful for every student. 

Only take this course if not taught by the same professor, or if you absolutely need it for your concentration credit.</comment>Victoria is often criticized for how she teaches this course. I disagree with people who criticize her - I think she is a solid professor and teaches the material well. The material, by nature, is rather dry, but also interesting at the same time since it is so applied. I think this is a great extension and a must take for anyone who wants to really understand data. A great follow-up to Stat 104.</comment>This course is analogous to Applied Math 105 (Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations) when it was taught by Michael Brenner: both courses are foundational courses in their respective departments/fields, both lean towards methods more than theory, and both are relatively disorganized.</comment>The content of this class is very interesting and incredibly useful. Though, I didn't feel like it was taught particularly well. I could learn almost as much from just looking at lecture slides as I could from attending class. Victoria was nice and clearly meant well, but she seemed quite out of touch with the students (the incredibly long midterm that she wrote is a prime example of that). The final project is pretty easy for a final project, and doesn't take too much time to do a satisfactory job. This is one of those classes that you sort of have to take if you want to have a solid knowledge of data analysis. I'm not really sure how it will be in the future, as Victoria is leaving after this semester.</comment>You learn important things which are very crucial for any interviews, etc. However, I was quite unhappy in the course. There were many factors responsible for this, including the fact that we had a final project, final presentation, AND a final exam (in addition to a mid term and regular psets). I'd recommend taking Econometrics in the econ department (the less theoretical one) where you'd learn about the same things, and learn them in Stata, which is what most researchers in econometrics use anyway.</comment>While Stat 139 covers incredibly useful and important techniques in statistics (you also learn an incredible amount of statistical assumptions in a wide range of test methods), it is not taught very well. Exams are incredibly long and hard to finish. Problem sets did not take as long as Stat 110 or 111 problem sets.</comment>This course is well-paced and well-taught. Prof. Liublinska is great at making time to talk to students to help them understand concepts (I definitely recommend making use of office hours and Piazza), which was helpful when there were details that needed to be clarified. I also liked the structure of the class: I felt that Prof. Liublinska designed it well, with the final project and the level of difficulty of the problem sets, for instance. It is clear that she truly values whether her students understand the material, and I liked her approach to teaching this course. I personally learned a lot and felt like I had a good understanding of linear models after completing this course.</comment>Really great class as an applied look at regression but the professor is AWFUL. Seriously. Utterly unpleasant in person who is incredibly inept at explanation while setting bizarre and pointless homework assignments. Regression material is way more useful than econometrics 1123/1126 but it's such a shame she teaches it</comment>I was not satisfied with the teaching in this course. The professor's lectures were not engaging and she doesn't do a good job making the concepts intuitive. Most of the learning is done with reading the textbook (which is really good) and doing the psets. The material is not difficult, but it's hard because the teaching is horrible.</comment>STAT 139 does a good job of covering simple and multiple regression in the context of real world examples and data. The final project is a great way to explore a concept or topic that is personally interesting to you - make sure that you have a good group!</comment>This class is useful but the lectures are a little dry and there is a lot of random stuff to remember</comment>No need to take this class. It's important material, but you can learn it on your own in 3 days or so.</comment>Take it if you really like statistics.</comment>The material is useful. Unfortunately, Victoria is a horrible lecturer. Often the concepts are simple but after she attempts to explain, things are more confusing. TF Jameson explained things much more clearly in section. I would recommend this course if taught by someone more competent. Do not take this or any other course taught by Victoria. I regret taking this course this semester.</comment>read the textbook.</comment>If you're interested in a class that actually teaches how to work with data and extract meaning from data, I think that this class does a very good job of providing you with those tools. It uses R quite extensively, so having some background in the software or some sort of coding background would be helpful. Even though I don't believe it has any formal requirements, stat 111 and stat 104 level material is helpful.</comment>Read the text book instead of taking this class unless there is a better lecturer.</comment>This class is very, very useful in your statistics education!  Be aware that the problem sets can be rather long and emphasize R a lot.  In addition, Victoria isn't the best at lecturing.</comment>be careful! It's wildly difficult and requires so much work outside of class that those who have outside commitments (i.e. graduate work) will find it hard to balance</comment>As it was taught this semester, I would strongly recommend that you not take this course and read the textbook instead.  The Statistical Sleuth is an excellent (though expensive) book with rich online resources to help you on the R component.  I would go to lecture understanding the material and walk out confused.  I would start a pset excited about the material and finish frustrated at the disorganization of the assigment.  What makes me maddest of all, though, is that I still can't bring myself to hate this class!  The teaching staff works so hard.  They are seriously online answering our questions around the clock, and they put themselves to such high standards in giving us detaied comments on so many assignments.  Simply put, the teaching staff is spread too thin, and for that matter, so are we the students across the different aspects of this course.  There is no reason that good faculty, good students, and good material should come together in such a sad, frustrating way.  All that having been said, if you have the tolerance for some course disorganization, this is material you really ought to learn one way or another if you are looking at courses in the Statistics department, and with so much potential in the course, hopefully your experience next semester/year will be better than mie!</comment>The material is very in depth and comprehensive. I learned a lot about tests and regression. This course emphasized the assumptions and interpretation, which would be very helpful for my job.</comment>Spend all the time necessary on problem sets and you'll be good to go. The book and lectures are good resources</comment>As someone from a non-statistics background, I have mixed feelings about this class. On the one hand, I learned a lot from it and feel much more confident about the statistics methods I plan on implementing in the future. At the same time, however, the class covered a lot of theory, manifested especially in derivations. Although we aren't really tested on these aspects of the course, they can be strenuous during class-time or in the homeworks if one doesn't have a whole lot of math or statistics background.</comment>As long as Victoria is teaching this class, I would look elsewhere.  The material itself is quite interesting, and the class has potential to be a good class, but in it's current state, it is not worth it.  Psets are extremely long (20 pages typed), and the midterm was quite unfair (it was 22 pages worth of problems).  There is also very little support for the students in such a class.</comment>Super useful for analyzing experimental data.  I'd recommend grad students in biology to take this class!</comment>Very good and useful class! A thorough treatment of basic applied statistics. The workload is very reasonable. Victoria is a very nice person and teacher.</comment>It was definitely the most practical and useful class I took this semester. Victoria is leaving next semester and Kevin is taking over so I can't comment on how the class will be structured/taught. Fingers crossed that Kevin will be good at teaching linear models.</comment>It's unfortunate that Victoria might not be teaching it next year.  Q comments from previous years had remarked that the course was disorganized.  That was not the case this year.  This year it was a well-oiled machine.

First half is hypothesis testing and second half is regression.  TFs were good, feedback was good, lecturing was solid, and assignments/assessments were very fair.  It's a useful course and overall painless.</comment>The first half of the course is a nicer version of Stat 111. That aside, I think I grasped the concepts much better here since Stat 139 went at a slower pace. The latter of the course is all linear models so if you were hoping for something besides Stat 111 + linear, look somewhere else.</comment>Don't take this class unless the professor is changed. Terrible organized class, which is a shame given how important the material is. Areas for improvement are countless. The grading for psets was arbitrary, the final project fair was inefficient and a waste of time, the midterm was way too long and hard, the teaching of the topic was poor, there were countless typos on the practice finals and the solutions for the finals (!!), the psets were way too tedious and R oriented, and just in general, a poorly run class. There are more things wrong with the class, but frankly, this alone should make you look for another class.

Don't take this unless the teaching staff is changed or there is a huge overhaul.</comment>More than anything, this course teaches valuable skills for analytical occupations. I and many of my peers (in an engineering graduate program) are interested in analytics and data science careers, and most agree that this course is extremely useful for such work.</comment>Take it with Rader. Stay away from Victoria</comment>This course is really good in teaching you concepts and techniques which are really applicable to using statistics in the real world. As in, given a dataset, you'll understand the pros and cons of using different testing approaches by the end of the course, and you'll have a wide repertoire of them.</comment>This was definitely one of the best classes I took in terms of applied statistics. Learning the considerations and assumptions that go into different statistical models is a vital skill for any stats major. The workload was moderate and the assignments were interesting. The midterm was a bit unfair because of how little time we had but hopefully that won't happen again in future years.</comment>This course is extremely useful for anyone in a data-driven field. You will learn when and how different statistical tests should be used and how to build simple linear models given a set of data. This course helps students develop and build intuition for data analysis.</comment>Not very well taught - really boring material. Much preferred Stat 110.</comment></course>SPANSH Acd: Intensive Beginning Spanish: Special Course</title>This course is conceived and reserved to a specific minority of students, which makes it hard to recommend to anyone. It is however great for learning the basis of the Spanish language, though another Spanish course is required in order to master it.</comment>Be prepared for an experience. You will become a family and learn so much. It can be a lot of work but also a lot of fun and a great way to learn a language.</comment>If you are thinking of traveling abroad, this is like a crash course boot camp that will whip you in shape to be able to communicate.</comment>This is a great class for those really interested in learning a lot of Spanish in a short period of time. You come out being able to understand and speak an impressive amount for just one semester. I'm not sure if Glenda will still be teaching, but she was absolutely wonderful. She was always enthusiastic and really cares about everyone. She even cooked for us a few times! The amount of class time may seem like a lot, but it doesn't feel very long when you're actually there. They use a lot of songs and videos to supplement the material, so class is always interesting</comment></course>MCB 115: Cellular Basis of Neuronal Function</title>The lectures are pretty dry, as Dr. Murthy doesn't generate very much excitement about subject material. Assignments are fair and the teaching staff is helpful. Exams are tricky but grading is generous.</comment>This is an amazing course. Incredibly rigorous and quantitative; you won't believe it's actually a biology course! You will actually see differential equations and real electrics in a bio course and come away with a strong, quantitative understanding of how a neuron works - not just the vague qualitative understanding you would usually expect from a bio course. Would strongly recommend to any neuroscientist and to any chemist/physicist whose interested in taking a little bio/neuro but wants something with a similar quantitative rigor to a physical science course. With a decent chemistry and physics background this course will be really interesting but also super easy even without any previous biology experience.</comment>Though this course had some organizational issues, the subject matter was surprisingly very interesting! This is definitely a part of neurobiology that all concentrators should learn, and if you attend lectures and be sure to ask questions as they come up, you will do fine in this course.</comment>Definitely learn more about neuro in this class than in 105. Having took both, I think I'm much better prepared to enter the neuro field with this course. I loved 105 too, but the content here is just so much more integral. Some disorganization issues, but overall awesome course</comment>Most of you will choose between this and MCB 105. Both courses are bound to be difficult due to the level of the subject matter. I recommend you take whichever of the two you find more interesting. They will both be hard. As for 115, know that the sections will not help much and the assignments are vague and require many clarification questions. All in all, an interesting class with some flaws.</comment>This class was difficult and not well organized, but it covered a lot of fundamental concepts that, as a neurobio concentrator, were really important to know and I feel like it gave me a much better background.</comment>This course was interesting, but I would probably shop 105 in the spring (if you're a neuro concentrator) just to make sure. The material is interesting, but lecture can often be difficult to understand. Be sure to form a study group- that's the only way I survived in the end. It was a great way to get all my questions answered.</comment>Very useful course, and you will definitely learn a lot. The midterm was a little unexpected in some ways, but overall, the course is streamlined and organized into a very logical series of lectures</comment>This is an interesting course, but can be difficult at times due to a lack of organization (which is weird because the course is fairly old). Nevertheless, Venki is a solid lecturer (sometimes the lectures were dry, but that is to be expected for an upper level neuro course) and the final exam seems fair. Study a lot for the midterm, because it is more difficult than the final and requires a conceptual understanding of most of the materials.</comment>Way better than anything MCB 105 could do. Venky is an awesome professor and really down to earth. Some of the material you cover will be direct from MCB 80 and that will be a bit repetitive, but the course really focuses on the experimental side and deductive approach, which is not something I’ve seen before in previous neuro requirements.</comment>I really liked MCB 115. Whereas MCB 80 just gives you a brief overview of everything, MCB 115 gives you a more in depth understanding of how neurons actually work and how they transmit signals. It was also interesting to be able to learn about the different experiments and techniques that were/are being used that have contributed to our current knowledge of neuroscience.</comment>Neurobiology concentrators have to take this. I would take this over MCB 105 because you come out feeling like you did learn a lot of neurobiology.</comment>difficult material- definitely have to put your own time in to understand the material for the tests.  Take really good notes during lecture!</comment>Solid and makes you think. Useful class.</comment>This is a course that I think every Neurobiology concentrator should take. It really delves into the cellular basis of a neuron, which is the foundation o neurobiology. That being said, the section component of the course and the assignments need work. They were both very disorganized. Prof Murthy is a very knowledgable, nice prof though. I would recommend seeking him out in office hours.</comment>This course is hard, a lot of material is covered in lecture, yet only components of it are tested.  The midterm is harder than the final, but the final is still difficult.  Go to Prof. Murthy's office hrs, I really wish I had done that before the last week of class!  Study lots of problems for the midterm and final.  Good luck...</comment>Take this over 105 if you're genuinely interested in the material, but don't expect an easy/smooth class. The material is fascinating, but it is often poorly taught and nit-picky, which makes the course incredibly frustrating rather than enjoyable. I felt like I couldn't have a neurobiology degree without knowing this stuff, and I definitely learned a ton, but it was a painful semester. 

Make outlines of the lectures outside of what's given as the course goes along, and expect to spend a lot of time on problem sets. (MATLAB bootcamp is not really necessary in preparation - huge waste of time, the psets give enough guidance for MATLAB problems). Section is optional but you'd be an idiot not to go. 

Venky is really cool, so are the TFs. Again, take this class over 105 if it's interesting to you, but prepare to put in a lot of time and effort.</comment>Both the professor and the tfs had good intentions and definitely tried to make sure you learned a lot; that being said, the lectures were very difficult to follow and the sections were highly disorganized</comment>This class was pretty good. I enjoyed it more than MCB105 (which i shopped and attended for a couple weeks last spring before deciding not to take it). It's a really good foundational neuro course, which covers the nuts and bolts you need to know for this field, and I feel as if i understand what I've learned about neurobiology at a much deeper level now that I've taken this class.</comment>The material in this class is interesting, and Prof. Murthy is a great guy, but the two just don't add up. I really struggled to pay attention in lectures, and also found my section TF did not really know what was going on.</comment>You learn a lot from this class but it is tough. I definitely feel like you can't call yourself a neurobio concentrator without taking this course, and you learn a ton. Also, Venki is a great professor!</comment>Go to Venki's office hours. They are really helpful</comment>Excellent intro to neuroscience. If interested in pursuing any kind of neuroscience post-grad, will need the information presented in this class.</comment></course>JAPAN 140a: Advanced Modern Japanese</title>You learn a lot of Japanese. Difficulty depends on what level of Japanese you have coming in. Can be a very heavy workload.</comment>It's a fantastic course that really helps you with your conversational and formal speaking skills. Highly recommended if you want to advance your Japanese studies, whether as an elective or part of your concentration requirements.</comment>Teachers are excellent, class is engaging but sometimes the disparate nature of the material makes it hard to gauge if one is making progress.</comment>Japanese 140a is all about reading comprehension. There will be speeches, presentations, and compositions (TONS OF THEM) so prepare yourself for A LOT of work. It should be easier on you if you work hard but if you haven't the time or the natural ability to read kanji on the fly like I did, then this course will take a very big chunk of your time.</comment>If you've taken previous Japanese courses, you know the drill by now. This one has more work than prior courses but follows the same basic structure.</comment></course>SOC-WORLD 25: Case Studies in Global Health: Biosocial Perspectives</title>Take it! It will force you to reconsider your views on poverty, healthcare, equality, and institutionalized discrimination. More likely than not, it'll influence your career plans too. The deification of Paul Farmer is a bit unnecessary, but the course is absolutely loaded with firsthand experience, including the TFs. There's no need to buy any textbooks except for the sourcebook and Reimagining Global Health (which is a dick move on the part of the course heads, having us by their own books and never using them). You can go down the rabbit hole of readings and dedicate hours on end to the course, or you can skate on by with just a few hours a week if you so desire. Great SW gen ed!</comment>SW25, depending on how you approach it, has the potential to be the best sort of course: the type that changes not just the things you know, but the way you think. SW25 imparts central lessons that is applicable far beyond the realm of global health - to consider a problem from the perspective of as many disciplines as possible, and to be wary of any answer that seems overly simple.</comment>This class is great if anyone and especially if you may be interested in global health, medicine, or anthropology. These are some of the best professors at Harvard. This class really makes you think differently and may change your path at Harvard. You must take it.</comment>Don't be freaked out by the essays at the beginning. There are only 4 and then you really don't have to do like any work besides the midterm and the final paper.</comment>It's a lot of reading, but a lot of it is interesting and/or relevant to the class. I feel a lot smarter after taking it, and it's the sort of class where the grading doesn't feel so important and you're able to focus on the material, which is interesting, rather than the stress of completing a million assignments.</comment>This was a great class, and the four professors each bring such different, amazing experiences to the course. Also, it was so nice to be in a class that addresses the human aspects of medicine.</comment>This course is important - I would highly recommend the class. The teaching staff is quite good, and the material is engaging.</comment>This class got me to think about global health from a different perspective than my normal bio, pre-med classes. That being said the lectures are very long although you don't need to attend all of them after the midterm because they are taped.</comment>The course is more work-intensive than other Gen Eds may be, but it pushes you in a really healthy way-you'll leave the course knowing a lot more about a whole variety of public health issues that contribute to a better understanding of how the world works.</comment>Good course that really covers a lot of topics within global health. All of the lectures are interesting, but unecessary to attend after the midterm which was noticeable in the emptiness of the lecture halls. Essays weren't too terrible although the word count limits made no sense. Take if interested in sociology or global health! However, a lot of the viewpoints in the course may not jive well with all students as they present a particular mode of thinking and viewpoints while not really exploring other perspectives.</comment>Amazing class, would highly recommend it for anyone who wants to have an understanding of the importance and issues facing global health and healthcare disparities around the world.</comment>This is an incredibly well designed and well executed course. The lecturers are incredibly influential and it is an honor to just hear them speak. The course also covers a broad range of topics so you are guaranteed to find inspiration in at least a few of the lectures and readings.</comment>This class is SUPER amazing and if you're looking for an engaging and profound way to fulfill Societies of the World, I'd definitely recommend taking this class. The readings are all so interesting (and definitely challenges your perceptions of health and foreign aid measures), and the lectures are really great! The professors are some of the best in the field and they've done so much work in other countries, that they not only teach interesting things but they bring a very personal perspective to the topics they cover. I love this class and I wish I had found the time to put more effort into it because it has been very fulfilling.</comment>If you are interested in a health profession, I recommend this course! It puts a lot of things in perspective and was my first introduction into the world of social theories.</comment>There's a lot of reading</comment>This class changes the way you think about the health of countries far away from you and even the way you think about our health care system in the US!</comment>This class is an exemplar of what all gen eds should be like.  They material is engaging.  The class is very well organized.  The Professors are big shots in their fields yet genuinely care about the undergraduate experience.  I certainly learned a lot of fulfilling material.  The course expects a commitment that seems about right for a gen ed.  It's not a walk in the park, but its' definitely not difficulty in any way if you do half of the readings and pay attention in class in section.  There is no need to do all the readings! Definitely do all the readings from the main textbook.</comment>This was my favorite class at Harvard. First, the teaching staff is SO supportive, accessible, and incredible. Second, the professors are all amazing, incredibly genuine, and openly adamant about their commitment to the field. All the lectures are accompanied by an open Q&A discussion that reveals more about the course. During the beginning of the course, there are a lot of mini essays that have to be written, but they're actually blessings in disguise because you learn so much and solidify knowledge about the social theories that can be applied in global health. The new textbook of the coursebook is honestly a keeper beyond the course because it has incredibly revolutionary ideas beyond the ideas one is exposed to in global health. The class tailors to any individual of ANY background, which is what makes it awesome and even more eye-opening. Lastly, I would really recommend doing the readings for the course, which on paper looks daunting, but are actually very illuminating especially in addition to lecture and section. The only con is that it's easy to tune out of the course after the midterm, and I wish I had paid more attention and attended more lectures post-lecture.</comment>Great class! The case-studies are engaging, and the professors do a good job of cultivating new ways to think about global health. It is quite a bit of reading, but overall manageable, and you come out of the class with a new sense of where global health stands in a modern context. Pretty profound class.</comment>This is not a very "personal" feeling course, and yet it really does provide you with tools and the frameworks to analyze reality in a depth previously impossible - which influences your personal life.</comment>This class really revolutionized the way I viewed healthcare and the role of social factors in its global allocation. The panelists/lecturers are all super distinguished and professional, and know what they are talking about. Merely being in their presence was a huge honor.</comment>great class, amazing instructors 
don't worry about all of the readings 
even if you just read the main textbook you should be fine 
workload really drops off after the midterm</comment>This a great class taught by leaders in the field of public/global health. If one is at all interested in the field, then they should consider taking it. That being said, the you get out of the class what you put into it. It is certainly possible to take the course and simply turn in the papers and go to section, skipping all of the lectures. However, the lectures are possibly the most valuable resource in the class, and give the most insight into the actual issues.</comment>This is a wonderful course with truly engaging lectures, professors who not only know but experienced the cases about which they speak, and readings that catch your attention after just a few sentences.</comment>You don't have to do all the readings--but do as many as you can because they are really interesting and help you with writing papers.</comment>An incredible course from the first lecture to the very last. The several professors that ran lectures were incredible people with vast experiences in the field of global health. This course leaves you with a better understanding of the world around you and what can and what must be done to improve it.</comment>One of the best classes I've taken at Harvard. And no, you don't need to do all (really any) of the readings to get something out of it.</comment>Take it! It's great. You learn a lot, you have fabulous professors, and its fun. 
It doesn't feel like a lecture class- it feels like we're all in it together: the professors, the students, the TFs. It's like we're all trying to learn how to make the world better together. 
I'm so glad I took this class!</comment>This course is so necessary for learning about how to apply social theories to catastrophic situations around the world today and how to structure public health interventions.</comment>The class was great.  the material is fantastic and engaging.  The reading is heavy and since there is no check on the material, its very easy not to do it.  thats one of my biggest regrets with this class</comment>While not going too in depth into any particular disease, nation, or time period, this class is a great survey course for students interested even tangentially in global health.  The readings are voluminous, but not always necessary to prepare for lecture and succeed in the class.</comment>This course allows to analyze many important problems in Global Health today through the lens of social theories. This course gives an enlightening and refreshing view on the world.</comment>This wasn't life-changing, but it was definitely a solid Gen Ed that provided an enlightening survey of the field of medical anthropology. I'd call it a gateway course--take it to see if you like global health/public policy, and go from there. Some of the lectures were dry, but you come out with a toolbox of social theories that can easily be applied to your other pursuits.</comment>This is one of the most incredible and inspiring classes I have ever taken.  I found myself reading the textbook for fun when I didn't have other work to do, because the way that these amazing professors view the world and the issues of global health is beyond enlightening, and provides an optimism for and faith in the future that is unparalleled.</comment>AMAZING. You will come out of it a better, more wordily person.</comment>Go to all the lectures. The work is very manageable and this is one of those courses you can get a lot out of without having to slave over it.</comment>This class is very interesting and very easy to succeed in. You will get so much more out of it if you do the readings and go to lecture.</comment>Really, really interesting course-- highly recommend.</comment>This class is very interesting but is very much an introductory class into global health. You study theories that can be applied to case studies, but there's little pressure to solve real world problems. It's a very front-heavy class, since there are 4 short papers and an in-class midterm in the first month and a half. The second half is very easy--other than a final paper, there are no evaluations after that. There's a lot of reading but (after the midterm) there's little motivation to do it. Try to read them, though, because they're very interesting.</comment>This course did not change my view on global health and I did not get the same feeling all of those who took this class before (and wrote it in the Q guide) got. Some weaknesses: the course lectures are too disjointed, too many guest lecturers, professors not always present at lectures

strengths: professors themselves are great and if you reach out, you will probably enjoy the class a lot more.</comment>Very informative but must be willing to put in the work</comment>This class will introduce you to different ways of thinking about issues around the world, not just health issues.</comment>This is a great General Education class, but aside from requirements it is also a good course to take just to be more informed about the world.  It was eye-opening to realize how many aspects of nonprofits and health care were socially constructed or influenced by primarily political motives.  If you are interested in the Global Health and Health Policy secondary field, take this course to see whether or not your are interested in exploring the topics further.</comment>This has been one of the best classes I have taken at Harvard. It has taught me to think about global health problems from a biosocial perspective, and has sparked my interest in the field of global health. It has taught me that health does not come from only biological sources, but social ones as well.</comment>Although SW25 was not a bad class, it is way overhyped.  Probably if I hadn't been told that it would change my life, I would have been less disappointed.  I found the lectures often less interesting than I would hope, and that the professors were not so accessible.  The class itself is like an advertisement for Partners in Health, which I mean is a nice organization doing good things, but the approach was a bit one-sided.  I was thinking about a global health secondary, and pretty enthusiastic about global health, but now I'm not really sure.</comment>This class is an awesome introduction to global health and medical anthropology, definitely take it if you're at all interested in entering public health or medicine! Minimal workload and fairly easy grading.</comment>Take this course if you are truly interested in the world social condition. It is not good for purely medical-minded students, nor is it good for those without deep interest in sociological factors of international civilizations. If your interest in this specific topic is not strong enough, you may find the class to get quite dry early on in the semester. The final paper is a great way to expand on what you have learned during the semester and apply it to a unique area of interest for yourself.</comment>really interesting class addressing real problems in the world that are going on outside the walls of Harvard. These professors are really amazing and accomplished people and are really inspirational. You learn a lot of cool things and theory - just take it! It really forced me to look at the world and disparities between developed and developing countries differently, and I would not be surprised if this course is responsible for having some influence on my future career path.</comment>Great overview of public health issues. Pretty simple writing assignments. Lectures are interesting</comment>This is a wonderful course that will train you to think analytical about the social forces influencing global health.  You will not only gain a strong understanding of the fundamental theories shaping the field, but will also learn to apply your knowledge in a variety of historical and international contexts.</comment>This course gives a great grounding in global health. It will affect the way you look at health and medicine and give you an idea of what you may want to do in the field if you are interested; and a good and important understanding of the field otherwise. The professors have spent their lives doing the work that they present in class and and invested in creating a space in which students who are interested in global health can start to pursue that interest. Definitely recommended.</comment>This course was very interesting, and gave a comprehensive and broad overview of global health issues and interventions. Definitely recommended, as it wasn't insanely difficult, but I still learned quite a bit.</comment>This class doesn't require much effort and is pretty interesting, so you still take something away from it.</comment>fun class with a large workload in terms of reading but very rewarding</comment>Take this class! It changed the way I think about the entire world and my position in it.</comment>Great class! It was very cool (and unfortunate) to be taking the class during the Ebola epidemic. However, due to this year's circumstances, the class became a little disorganized.</comment>Take this class if you wish to explore the field of global health. No prior background experience is required. The readings are plentiful, but worth it. You will be confident on a number of different global health topics after having taken this class.</comment>If you have the slightest interest in global health case studies--as long as it's genuine--you will want to explore it in THIS class.</comment>Take it if you really want to be exposed to global health.</comment>This is an amazing class that really challenges the way you view health institutions</comment>This class is the best class to take if you have an interest in global health or just want a different perspective on the world. It will change the way you think about global health and healthcare in general, and will leave you feeling empowered to make a difference in the world. The workload is very manageable, and the lectures are incredible, with the lecturers being leaders in the field.</comment>Take this course! The lectures are great and the subject matter is incredibly important. This class made me cry in and outside of lecture (super awk right?) but it was worth it. I am not premed like many of the people in the class (or at least the people they seem to be catering the class to), but this is still important stuff to understand.</comment>Make the most out of this fantastic course.</comment>Whatever they hear about the course from other students is all true! This course is amazing!</comment>This class is the most amazing, eye opening class I've taken at Harvard! That is all.</comment>I would say that this course is truly life-changing. It allows a deeper understanding for why certain health issues are present in different parts of the world, and teaches using a holistic understanding of human well-being.</comment>This is a great course. The work is manageable, the lectures are awesome and really relevant once you get to some of the case studies. I even found the social theories to be really interesting. Pray for Jason as your TF, he's the best. Honestly, the class is such a reasonable gen ed, such good knowledge to have, and I times I even found it impossible NOT to pay attention.</comment>This course changes your perspective on world issues. Maybe not in the extravagant way they advertise during shopping week but I definitely came out with a better understanding of international dynamics when it comes to global health. Out of all the topics covered, you're bound to find one that really resonates with you.</comment>This is a great course and everybody should take it! amazing teaching team, great assignments and not too difficult!</comment>this class is SO entertaining, interesting, and definitely not too hard!</comment>Incredible and eye opening course if you want to go into global health</comment>There is a ton of reading for this course but I definitely learned a lot</comment>This class wasn't as cool as I hoped it would be (the "case studies" refers to about three examples that are repeated for several lectures each), but it's a pretty solid SW gen-ed. There's a huge emphasis on social theories, which was annoying, but the assignments are short, the midterm is straightforward, and there's literally nothing after the midterm except a 13 page research paper on a topic of your choice, so you can basically check out halfway through the semester.</comment>I really enjoyed this class! I feel that what I learned will be useful to me as I pursue a career in medicine and global health, and the professors/teaching staff are great! After the midterm there aren't many assignments besides the Final Paper, but keep going to lecture! It will make your final paper that much better and the lectures are really interesting.</comment>This class is the best Gen Ed course I have taken at Harvard. I think that it does a great job of exposing you to many different areas of global health without trying to become your most important or time consuming class, which is really refreshing considering a lot of Gen Eds try to do that because they're mad that people take them because they're easy. With that said, its stress-free environment, it made the material much more enjoyable and I actually learned a lot more than what I thought I would.</comment>SW 25 is easily one of the most meaningful classes you're ever going to take in Harvard. Whether you're interested in global health or not, the class really challenges how you think about the world and in particular how to deal with health issues around the world.</comment>Make sure you make time to talk to the professors and your TF and get feedback.  In a class this size and given their somewhat high profile jobs, the professors won't get to know you unless you reach out.</comment>Take this class, especially if you love global health! The atmosphere, the content, and the teaching team are amazing and I learned a lot - I even enjoyed writing the final paper. It was by far my favourite class freshman fall semester.</comment>This course is a great opportunity to learn from the most prominent experts in the field of global health and will change the way that you view policies toward health worldwide and in the US. There are a lot of interesting readings- read them if you can, as they are great food for thought. Other than the readings, the course is very manageable in workload and difficulty. The lectures are very relevant to current affairs. Make sure to ask questions of the professors during and after lecture- they can seem intimidating but are very nice and want to interact with undergraduates.</comment>There is a lot of work but much of it is unnecessary, which feels somewhat frustrating. Lectures are often really interesting, but definitely run the gamut.</comment>A great course to take if you are interested in global health but do not have much background</comment>TAKE THIS COURSE. This is the best class I have taken at Harvard. All the lecturers and every lecture is amazing. Section is wonderful. I really loved learning from the other students in the course as well. This course changed my life trajectory. I want to only work at mission-driven organizations now and am considering careers in public/global health. It was that inspiring.</comment>If you are thinking about going into global health I would definitely take this course. It is inspirational to hear from leaders in the field, great for networking, and the final paper lets you write about any topic that interests you.</comment>It's an incredible course that is about so much more than global health. Take it because you will learn so much more than you thought you ever could in one term, and become a much more informed global citizen. Favorite course I took this term.</comment>It's easy but seriously an amazing intro to public health. Just google the professors! You'll see that their work is really the future of the field.</comment>Overall, great course! All professors are superstars in the field of global health. Course load is a bit on the heavy side( for a gen ed) for the first month or so (there are weekly papers due for a total of four papers.) However, after the first four papers and the midterm, you don't have to go to any of the lectures if you have a busy semester. Final paper at the end was kind of long, but not too bad. I can honestly say that I've learned a lot of useful concepts in this course! if you're interested in global health at all, definitely take it!</comment>The readings are necessary, but at times redundant. At the very least, make sure to read from the core textbook and and the works of the lecturers. You get what you put in for this class. Grades are not so much of an indication of how much work or effort you put in and so actually learning the material is ascribed more to passion and enjoyment than the need to get a good grade.</comment>Great class that will expose you to many important injustices and problems int the world. Definitely worth taking.</comment>The lectures and lecturers are fascinating: each is really at the top of their field, and all have done amazing work and are there to share it with you. That experience is pretty unparalleled. The class is really structured so that you get out of it what you put in - it's not super challenging but it can be difficult and it does challenge you to think super deeply. All the work is relevant and requires a lot of thought - there's very little busy work.</comment>This class is honestly moving. You become exposed to atrocities that affect people all over the world, as well as to your own biases.</comment>This class will give you a broad overview of global health and social theories. In fact, it may be more social theory than one might expect, but as someone who has no experience with this sort of mindset, it was really eye-opening. This class does do case-studies on global health issues, and it will push you to explore issues you might not be comfortable with. The TFs and the professors are great! The one drawback is that there's a lot of reading.</comment>This is a good introductory global health class. The TFs have diverse backgrounds and the professors are top in their fields. If you are interested in working in development or global health, I would take this.</comment>One of the most profound educational experiences of my life.</comment>This was a great class that will give you great exposure to global health and the field of medical anthropology.  The teaching staff is great, and it's one of the most inspiring courses I've taken at Harvard.  These are professors who are deeply invested in both their research/fieldwork and teaching, which is hard to come by.</comment>I loved this course, it's not terribly difficult but you gain such a useful skillset that not only can be used in implementing something global health related but can also be used in understanding humans on any level.</comment>Take itttttt. You learn so much. So very engaging.</comment>most inspiering class i have taken in 3.5 years of studying.</comment>Take this class if you want an easy gen ed.</comment>This course is much relevant to those who intend to pursue a career in the field of medical anthropology or global health.</comment>Although possibly overhyped a little, this class does possess an enormous potential to change the way you think about the world. Most GenEds claim this, but SW25 really succeeded in my case. Very interesting range of material covered, manageable workload, pretty good teaching staff, etc. Mainly though, just the message that medicine and health are tied to social dynamics is enough to make this course very important (and rewarding).</comment>This class taught me so much about the world and my potential to contribute to it. I responded a ton to the biosocial framework employed--there's something for everyone, from anthropologists to economists to aspiring epidemiologists to historians and philosophers. The work load is manageable, and the class is designed to empower and inspire, not to trick you.</comment>Amazing class - inspiring and honest lectures, thought-provoking topics, professors who are the leaders in this still-developing field, TFs that are actually concerned with helping you understand the material and not about doling out grades. This class is what I imagined Harvard would be like. It's unreal - if you don't take this class, you're missing out. I loved it!</comment>There are a ton of readings. If you're pressed for time, make sure you at least do the readings for Farmer's lectures, because he specifically references/asks about them.</comment>This course was a great way to better understand how the west has affected the rest of the world over time and what that means for global health.  I think it was great!</comment>Take it because of Paul Farmer and Arthur Klineman.</comment>This is a fantastic class! You get to learn from 4 of the top scholars in the field of global health, all who offer really unique and interesting perspectives and stories from the work they've done. It really is an amazing experience, especially if you take advantage of office hours. The assignments are helpful and the final paper lets you study a question in global health that interests you. All in all, I think it's a great course. However, I will say that if you have taken a course on sociodeterminants of health, like Sociology 190 with Christakis, a lot of the themes are the same, so you might not find it as mind blowing as other people do. However, it's still a great class and definitely worth taking!</comment>There is literally no reason to go to class after the midterm (and very little before that)</comment>This class is AWESOME! The professors (and all of the guest lecturers) really know what they're talking about- I felt so fortunate to be learning about a lot of really important happenings in global health by the people actually addressing them. There's a lot of reading but you really don't have to do it to get by. If you're interested, I would highly encourage this course.</comment>SW 25 is a great class! You definitely learn new ways to think about global health, and the wide variety of lecturers is great. Be warned that at first, the class seems like a LOT of work - you have four short papers followed by a midterm in the first two months. But after the midterm, the only remaining assignment is the final paper, which is actually nice because SW 25 becomes a low-key class as the rest of your classes really pick up in the second half of the semester.</comment>This is one of the most enlightening and important classes you can take. It provides an excellent introduction into the study of global health. More than that, it forces you to rethink the way global health problems are popularly understood and often dealt with. This class demonstrates how health problems are so much more than just biological problems. Exceptionally well-taught, fascinating, and eye-opening.</comment>Take it! It is a very interesting course, and will open your mind to a rigorous understanding of global health.</comment></course>COMPSCI 284r: Topics on Computation in Networks and Crowds</title>Good course to take to get a feel of what's the current areas of graph algorithms and research are</comment>What you get out of this class really depends on your interest in the material and how much work you want to invest. I was not interested in many of the papers we read for each class, so did not get much out of most classes. Yaron seemed to pick papers based on what he wanted an excuse to read, rather than what he thought would be best for students to learn about. Nor did he try to generate enthusiasm among the students. So while I learned a lot from a few of the papers, I felt that most of my time in this course could have been better spent elsewhere.</comment>The course covers very interesting material! Assignments and projects can be somewhat disorganized, but all in all if you're interested in the subject matter you'll find it rewarding.</comment></course>VES 41a: Introduction to Still Photography</title>This class was UNBELIEVABLE. Definitely one of the best classes I have taken at Harvard. Not to be over the top, but it changed my life and the way I think. David and Ryan were incredible teachers, and they were encouraging, but also pushed us to think deeper and to try new things. There were definitely challenging parts, and I worked very hard, but the work was quite rewarding. I feel so lucky to have taken this class and to have been exposed to the art of photography. I can't wait to take what I learned in this class and apply it to my life to come.</comment>David and Ryan were the best teaching team I could ask for. By looking at our final projects, I think it's clear that our class is more technically adept and conceptually complex than the other intro classes taught by another professor. Definitely not a class you can do no work for, but you can never become a better photographer without picking up your camera! The assignments were manageable but challenging. Lectures were discussion based, comprehensive, and fascinating. Critiques were thought provoking and constructive. AMAZING class. Take it before David leaves!!</comment>try to get in.</comment>TAKE THIS CLASS! You will NOT regret it- I can't recommend it enough. David and Ryan are two of the funniest people (and hands-down teachers) I've ever met, and are also incredible artists I truly look up to. I began this class with no background in photography and a bit nervous about critiques, but all feedback has been so valid and delivered out of a desire to help me improve. The small class size makes for a really great environment and overall photography for me has been such a creative outlet and release from the stress of my other classes. It encourages me to get off campus and think critically about art, and I could not have asked for anything more from this course.</comment>expect to spend a lot of hours in lab outside of class - enjoyable but time consuming</comment></course>HINDI-URDU 102: Intermediate Hindi-Urdu</title>This is a great class in which you will learn the language at a great pace. Small setting helps, and the Professor is very invested in his class!</comment>Recognize that his year is not as relaxed as 101 and the pace definitely picks up! But once you understand that and prepare yourself, the course is amazing.</comment>If in doubt, take it.</comment>Take initiative in this class. Richard ji is very chill and let's you take control over your own learning BUT you only get out as much as you put in.</comment>This is the most amazing language course ever with the most amazing professor at Harvard. He is amazingly understanding and committed to helping you learn. He is also incredibly flexible in order to ensure that you actually learn the language.</comment></course>EXPOS 20.241: Paradox in Public Health</title>Good writing takes time and multiple revisions; don't procrastinate!</comment>Just try your hardest, don't procrastinate, and utilize office hours</comment>The class is extremely helpful in improving your writing quality for current and future classes in any discipline, but you must be willing to put in a considerable amount of work. Despite the fact that it is a course that fulfills a requirement, it is worth focusing on and prioritizing.</comment>If you like to write about science, then this class is for you!</comment>The class is super helpful in developing your writing, however it does take a lot of effort to be able to get out a lot of stuff.</comment>This was a great course that made me a much better writer, plus brought up some very important and interesting issues in public health.</comment>Don't fall behind on readings, but this is definitely an interesting class.</comment>At first, this class may seem like a lot of work, but in reality our workload seemed similar to that of most other expos students. Jerusha is extremely well organized and always prepared. She has refined the class so that every reading and activity has a purpose and helps you become a better writer. Though the course is challenging, she pushes you to improve your writing and address areas of weakness. I recommend taking this class if you think you might be interested in public health, though the topics we cover in this class are fairly broad and will give you a better understanding of the world even if you have no desire to pursue public health. This year, topics covered in this class ranged from vaccinations to smoking laws to salt iodization programs. From talking with peers in different classes, this is definitely one of the better expos classes to take. As an athlete, it also gave me the chance to meet more non-athlete students than I would have if I had taken a class like Sports and the Law. This class is not the best, but it is certainly not the worst, and I recommend taking it.</comment>I recommend this course with great enthusiasm because Paradox in Public Health is fascinating and Jerusha is an amazing professor. Jerusha is knowledgeable and has very effective teaching techniques. I feel very well-prepared for writing in other courses at Harvard because the way she structures her course allows us to progress one step at a time to ultimately be ready to apply expos skills to other classes. She is also always there for us and helps each individual student with the specific areas on which they need to improve.</comment>This course is a great option if you are interested in the sciences or in medicine.</comment>The discussions in class are fun and interesting, and the work load is manageable if you work steadily throughout the course.</comment></course>PHIL 252: The Ethics of Belief: Seminar</title>If you're interested in ethics, epistemology, or even philosophy of religion, you should absolutely take the course. Plus, you may never encounter an instructor as effective at dismantling opposing arguments as Professor Rinard.</comment>She knows her stuff.</comment></course>ECON 1011a: Microeconomic Theory</title>If you are willing to put the work in, it is a really awesome class.</comment>Ride the curve.</comment>This class is as difficult as everyone says, but it is manageable to get the work done. However, I'm not sure how much I actually took away from this class regarding specific skills and knowledge. I think my style of learning fits better when I have a smaller amount of material to learn, even if the class itself is more boring. Overall though I think this class made me more excited about economics and helped me see how I could actually apply what I'm learning.</comment>Very hard, time consuming. Take it as your main class if you're able to put some time in. I'd imagine that it's rewarding if you can give a lot to it.</comment>This class is super hard. REALLY HARD. But you learn so much. You learn to mode, to think analytically, develop economic intuition, and work with very bright peers. Just be prepared to be painstakingly meticulous if you want to maximize the amount of utility you get out of this class (an exercise you can do in your sleep after you take this class).</comment>Taught me how to think like an economist!</comment>The class is extremely hard--there is no hiding that. But you leave really feeling like you understand math and creative problem solving better. Also, a real community built on mutual suffering develops in the class so there is really no point where you feel like you are alone. No matter how hard the material is, the people and the TFs made everything sort of in reach and the class was overall a positive (though at times sleepless) experience.</comment>Ec 1011a is an excellent course with an exceptionally dedicated teaching staff. Yes, it's a lot of work, and yes, it's difficult, but you learn how to do economics mathematically. The course is genuinely interesting because of the topics that we consider, and I'd say it gets more interesting as you go along. The last third of the course, about game theory, is especially fun. I had only taken math through 21a, and that was enough preparation in terms of calculus. However, it does seem that this class would be difficult without some statistics/probability theory -- I was simultaneously in Stat 110 (as much of the class is), but I imagine it could be a lot more confusing with 110. (Stat 104 is a very weak substitute.)</comment>Modeling Projects - read other papers online. Sections and OH - go, they are probably more useful than lectures. P Sets - actually try to do them even though grading is really, really lenient. Class as a whole - recommended to those interested in economics and comfortable with multivariable calculus.  Hard class, but really quite manageable and doable.</comment>Ec 1011a is something exceptional--it teaches you how to think rigorously as an economist, sure, but it also establishes a framework for how to think about problems in society and how individuals relate to one another. One of my favorite courses at Harvard, and it makes me regret not taking more Ec while here.</comment>Great course with interesting topics. Be prepared to work hard</comment>This class is challenging and requires a fair amount of time commitment, but is so much more rewarding than Ec 1010a and helps tremendously in building economic rigor and intuition behind all that fun Ec 10 stuff. If you're not comfortable with multivariable calculus, this class probably isn't for you, but if you're coming in without too much economics knowledge but have a strong math background, you'll do just fine.</comment>I took this class as an elective with no previous economics experience and do not regret it. The class's focus is on getting your hands on the real math and quantitative material economists work with. It's good practice for multivariable, economic modeling and intuition.

This year was different from others with Ponzetto teaching instead of Glaeser, so further comments may not apply to future classes. To be clear, I overall enjoyed the class; lectures were interesting and fun, and my sections were well structured. 

But in general the weekly experience was this: material was marred by disorganization and lack of structure. It was often frustrating to see that the details of the material were sometimes not paid attention to and remained ambiguous or unclear. 

The problem sets were my real complaint: often very poorly written, irrelevant, not proof read or even non sensical. (I've heard this is an unusual problem: with Glaeser the psets are instead just very hard.)

It took extra work on my part to get ambiguities cleared up and piece material floating in different places together, but in the end I did learn a lot of things (though I lack practice at doing the math due to the pset problem mentionned above). I loved the opportunity to get acquainted with the real language and thought process behind economics.</comment>The modeling projects are EXTREMELY demanding, however as an Econ concentrator, I think this will help me much more than 1010 in marginal analysis and the development of mathematical intuition.</comment>Do not take this class, worst mistake I've made thus far (and that says alot!).</comment>This class is extremely difficult and unfortunately, unrewarding.  There is a big gap between what is taught in class, what is expected on problem sets, and what you are ultimately tested on during the midterm and final.  The sections and online practice problems were, for the most part, disorganized to the extreme.  Usually, I recommend tough classes because of what you take out of them.  Here, I cannot.</comment>If you love multivariable calculus, and can think and dream in calculus, then you should take this course. You won't learn that much economics, but you will learn how graduate level microeconomics is done.</comment>While clearly a stronger alternative to Ec 1010, 1011 leaves a lot to be desired.  Overall, great professor, great section, great tests.  However, terrible p-sets.  They are poorly written and almost impossible to understand, making is so that many students cannot complete them, turning in sub-par work.  I learned a lot and put in a lot of work, but I would be wary of taking this course unless you are willing to put in a lot of extra time into the class.</comment>Econ 1011a is far more challenging than 1010a, but also more rewarding from everything I've heard. If you can handle the math, 1011a will give you a very practical set of skills (modeling, optimization, game theory) that can be applied to just about any economic situation.</comment>Only take this class if you're looking for a mathematics course with a tiny bit of economic flavor. Definitely only for Applied Math concentrators rather than Economics concentration or secondary.</comment>This class is hard, but worth it if you like modeling/economics.  Glad I took the class and feel better for it</comment>Very difficult class but you do get a lot out of it in the end if you are willing to put in the time and effort.</comment>This course is very hard, a lot of work, and often frustrating. If you are ambitious and love economics, you should definitely take it. If not, probably not.</comment>This class is an excellent introduction to intermediate microeconomic theory and mathematical modeling. While it is extremely difficult at times, particularly in the case of the modeling projects, it teaches you a great deal. The teaching is quite effective; while the sheer breadth of the material covered made it necessary for some topics to be covered very quickly, the course's use of Piazza made it possible for students to get the help they needed. The teaching staff is very good; Professor Ponzetto is very engaging and knowledgeable as a lecturer, and quite approachable outside of class, while my TF, Andrew Das Sarma, was great at helping us understand the material through rigorous and sometimes pretty hilarious problems in section. Take this if you have a relatively moderate course schedule, and are up for a challenge; it is not easy, but if you are genuinely interested in the class, it is worth it.</comment>Piece of cake.</comment>When they say that you can take this class even if you don't have extreme familiarity with mathematical concepts "if you put in the extra work", they really mean it. You will have to work much harder than many of your peers who are familiar with abstract math, have taken modeling/probability courses etc. And even if you do all the work needed, the marginal returns per hour of study are hardly worth it. Take 1010a, work less, and get more out of it, without loosing sleep for nothing.</comment>If you're planning on taking this class and the most math you've taken is 21a, don't. The class will assume knowledge of proofs and some statistics, and you will feel uncomfortable asking for these concepts to be clarified when it seems like all of the other physics/stat/math geniuses in your class understand everything. This is an unnecessarily hard class and will not leave feeling like you learned a significant amount of economics.</comment>This class is hard, but rewarding. You will learn so much in this class, but be prepared to put in the time and effort.</comment>It's frustrating, it's angering, and it might even make you want to rip your hair out in the process.  But, it's worth it in the end.  You don't learn much new economics in this class, because that's not the point of the class.  The point is to learn mathematical modeling applied to economics-related situations, and to learn how to think about problems far more analytically.</comment>It as incredible class if you have the time to commit to it and the math background to handle it.  I struggled but I'm definitely happy I took it.</comment>This is a great class and the material is very well organized. A thorough understanding of multivariable calculus is definitely helpful; some understanding of real analysis and probability is also complementary.</comment>This class is, as most people will tell you, quite difficult. To some extent, your success may be contingent on the quality of the teaching staff.

You'll be surrounded by very intelligent people, taking a very rigorous class. The situation will at times feel intimidating, but I have to say that this was one of the most enjoyable classes I took. I honestly felt like I was learning a lot. The content is consistently engaging, though--because problem sets and section notes and modeling projects and answer keys are recreated yearly by the teaching fellows--not always consistent in quality.

From reading past Q scores, both 1010 and 1011a had very positive and very negative reviews. The negative reviews for 1011a all said it was too hard; for 1010a they claimed it was too boring. Too hard or too boring--take your pick.</comment>What a waste of time... you don't learn anything that is not trivial. Lecture format with slides is terrible, there is no textbook, the problem sets are badly done. The material is interesting somewhere deep down, but this class will only bring you disappointment.</comment>This is a great course. It is not an easy course. Especially near the beginning, you will likely feel lost, but by the end of the course you will see that the work paid off and will come away with a real understanding of economic modeling and a new way to look at and analyze the world. If you are willing to put in the work, definitely do this over Ec1010.</comment>Be prepared to be lost. Completely and utterly lost. You are on an expedition towards knowledge and your instructors only have slightly more idea where they are going than you do. This class is a great class for anyone at Harvard who thinks he/she is very smart. By the end of the class you will realize you aren't. That said, it's a challenge, and when you survive it, or understand a concept, it is one of the best feelings in the world.</comment>Do not take this class- you learn very little if you have ANY other commitments because there just isn't the time- basically, all I have learned is that YES I CAN TAKE A DERIVATIVE.  Then its just a demoralizing class and not worth taking.</comment>Very interesting subject material.</comment>It's a hard course, but if you really want to get good at economic theory and/or multivariable calculus and/or economic modeling, you should take it.</comment>I would be honest about the difficulty and the frustration that comes with a very interesting course.</comment>Good class.  The material is somewhat bland but it is presented very effectively.</comment></course>HIST 1445: Science and Religion in American History</title>This is a great class if you are interested in religion in American history, and especially the way religion and science have interacted in the past. I thought this was a really great course. It is not the lightest Gen Ed in terms of workload, but I found it very rewarding. You are forced to grapple with some of the biggest questions in life, and read about how earlier (and more recent) thinkers tried to answer those questions. I think thiat is something everyone should have to do, and this is a great way to get yourself to think about some of these big ideas.</comment>Make sure to attend lecture because there is a lot of information. Section allows you to delve into the philosophy a little more, but lectures are mostly historical context. There is quite a bit of work: 3 papers, readings are often long (but highlighted making them MUCH easier) weekly responses and a final. Overall the class is an interesting topic and would be great for fulfilling general education requirements.</comment>Lectures and assignments focus too much on the 'American History' and not enough on the 'Science and Religion'. The readings are interesting.</comment>The class was pretty interesting, but I made the mistake of taking it in a semester during which I had a lot of other work more important for my intended concentration. The class was fine, and if you have the time to devote to all the readings I would suggest you take it, but if you know you're going to be stressed or pressed to finish other things then I would wait.</comment>If you like science, religion, and politics, you will love this course. The assignments are manageable and the papers are interesting. If you aren't extremely into politics, some parts of this course will drag on a bit.</comment>Do the readings</comment>This is a pretty good class, and you walk away with some good material to know.  It covers a lot of ground, which is both good and bad (you often feel like you're cramming and not really getting into the material at hand because you have to move on).  At the end of the day, it's really a philosophy class, so that's something to definitely to consider.  Not really history, but philosophy.</comment>The lecture was great, the readings were not.</comment>Overall, this was a good course. It got me to think a lot about religion, both in terms of how it has functioned in American society previously as well as my own life.  The assignments are a bit non-standard, which makes them more fun to complete.  Professor Jewett obviously enjoys teaching and has an engaging lecture style.  Some of the material from the middle 1/3 of the class is a bit dry, but the rest is quite engaging.</comment>Great class but sometimes hard to follow.</comment>TAKE IT!!! Jewett is one of the best lecturers you will ever have.

Especially take it if you are a science person, it made me think a lot more about the cultural, political, and ethical implications of science.</comment>It's a good class with good material. Be prepared for alot of reading</comment>This class was superb in almost every way.  The lectures and readings were engaging, profound, and flow smoothly from one to the next.  If you have any interest in how religion has shaped the scientific, intellectual, and cultural development of America, you owe it to yourself to take this class.</comment>The material is super interesting, and I would say it is a nice way of fulfilling USW/CB requirement. Make sure you keep track of the IDs throughout the semester though, or it will be a (slight) pain at the end of the semester.</comment>Interesting material, but a decent amount of reading some weeks for a gen ed.  There are easier ones, but this class is probably worth the time.</comment>This is a pretty good class; the readings are interesting, and lectures are, as well. A vast amount of very different ideas are thrown at you, and not all of them are able to stick easily.</comment>HIST 1445 was a great introduction into American religious thought, particularly with how Professor Jewett juxtaposes it to science and government. Excellent class -- really brought many difficult moral questions that I had thought about to the fore, where we discussed them, their origins, and the different groups that support different positions.</comment>Not very difficult, sometimes interesting, but not as engaging or useful as I had hoped.</comment>The professor is a good guy, and if you enjoy this subject matter you'll enjoy the class.</comment>This class was very poorly organized. While it has the capacity to be very interesting, Jewett's lectures are incredibly difficult to follow and it is hard to see how they connect between each other and to the readings.</comment>HIST 1445 was an interesting course and I enjoyed learning the material. However, because there is no midterm, I would encourage future students to actually keep up with the material so as to not ruin themselves for the final. It would be useful to have a pretty comprehensive understanding of US history - the major movements and events. The teaching staff can take this knowledge for granted, and it adds extra work if you are not familiar with these terms and concepts already.</comment>A solid course that leaves you with a solid body of knowledge about the interplay between science, religion, politics, education, and public culture in the US. Useful and relevant things to know. Readings were dry and authored nearly exclusively by dead white men, thought definitely manageable in length. Lectures were consistently interesting, and Prof Jewett is great.</comment>This is a very interesting class that definitely skews more towards history/religion than science. It's a history of religion and the slow introduction of science, not the history of science/discoveries in America. As a science concentrator, it was a little out of my comfort zone, but extremely interesting nonetheless. You definitely have to do the readings and pay attention in lecture as it's not taped/the slides aren't very robust.</comment>Go to lecture, take good notes. It might seem like you can skip it, but it'll make your life easier when writing essays or studying for the final.</comment>The lectures are painfully boring because Prof. Jewett read from a script every class and made little effort to be engaging or dynamic. Most people I know nod off after 30 minutes or so. It's highly worthwhile and important material so it's a shame the lectures were such a drag. Grades are highly dependent on your TF and expectations for essays were often unclear, but it's definitely possible to get by if you take the time to find out what your TF is looking for. There were 4 to 6 readings per week and sections never adequately covered them in depth due to the number of them. However, I came to enjoy sections and we had really good discussions towards the end of the course. Form a study group for finals so you can help each other through the tougher readings. All in all, I would recommend the course with reservations. The content is highly interesting--how religion and science conflict and compromise in American history is complex and, if you can stay awake long enough, lectures mapped out many important events necessary to understand the current world.</comment>This is a good way to fulfill the USW requirement through a class that is probably a bit more engaging than your average gen ed. We covered a great deal of material, and while it felt fast at times, it was great to get such a broad background in the topic. Reading was not overwhelming, and we got to study some interesting primary sources. The topic was also very interesting, especially given its continued relevance in American culture and institutions</comment>Its a good Gen Ed with a good lecturer. Try your best to actually go to lecture.</comment>HIST 1445 is an interesting twist on American history with emphasis on science and religion. The readings were often very engaging, although expect to read a lot of primary sources. On that note, the reading assignments and essays were very manageable, although I would say that it was hard to get a stellar grade. In hindsight while studying for finals, I realized that we have covered a lot of topics and many interesting connections could be made with each of the readings and thinkers/activists. Keep up with the readings and constantly review, and you will be in good shape.</comment>Easy but in no way engaging</comment>This is a nice Gen Ed to take that is not too time consuming.</comment>The material we covered in this course was interesting. However, it would have been better named "Science and Christianity" - we did not talk very much about any non-Christian religion. The final exam seems daunting but is actually manageable. Some of the readings are interesting, some are harder to understand. If you pay attention in lecture and study well though you will come out with a lot of knowledge about the material.</comment>The best gen ed of the 5 I've taken so far. The ideas presented are extremely relevant to understanding American culture and extremely engaging to hear and discuss. Course readings were varied in nature, from practical to philosophical, so there's something for everyone. You'll write three essays, each in a different style, which is an extremely fair setup for all kinds of writers. You'll learn about religion in America from its founding to the present day, making the class timely and timeless.</comment>Difficulty varies greatly with section</comment>Great class with excellent lectures. Lots of philosophy and very heavy on intellectual history, so be prepared for that.</comment>Prof. Jewett is a great lecturer and the teaching staff cares a lot about the course. The expectations on the first assignment were not well communicated and thus the grading felt a bit arbitrary, but on the whole it was a good course and the readings were engaging.</comment>The course is an incredibly interesting and challenging study of the academic history in our country surrounding science and religion. Lectures are hit or miss, some cover topics that are really interesting (evolution, eugenics, specific lectures about Harvard...) while others are very hard to understand. The work isn't bad. 3 essays 5 pages each felt reasonable, but often the short size was very limiting.</comment>This class is a pretty easy way to get rid of either the culture and belief or US and the world gen ed. It has very few assignments, the essays are pretty short and simple, and isn't that big of a time commitment. The essays are also graded more easily than I thought they would be, which is nice. This course isn't as interesting as you first think it might be, as it get's a little dry and seemingly irrelevant/unrelated to itself towards the middle of the class material, but still I didn't think it was a waste of time. Be prepared for sections that were boring and slightly awkward and for a final that requires a ton of preparation to essentially memorize the 60 (excessive) readings from the semester, but other than that good course that is fairly interesting with minimal work.</comment>An interesting and well-taught class. Definitely learned a lot about the topic. Good level of work for a Gen Ed.  Professor Jewett gives you the terms that will be relevant for the final exam at the beginning of each class, so be sure to take notes on these during lecture. It'll make studying for the final much easier.</comment>There are a bunch of readings, but the relevant parts are highlighted, Jewett is a really good lecturer, and sometimes the story is a bit hard to follow.  Overall, a great but not excellent course.</comment>If you are interested in the subject matter, than this course is really interesting. It also it a great way to satisfy your Gen Ed requirements if you are a science concentrator. However, its not the most engaging course you can take.</comment>This is the quintessential Harvard course. Take this course if you can when it's offered! Great way to fulfill a gen ed. Professor Jewett's lectures are engaging, the readings are interesting, and the assignments are thought-provoking, but not that hard and fun to complete. The first paper asked us to write a stump speech from the perspective of a candidate for the presidency whom we invented. The third paper asked us for our own opinion what the relationship between science, religion, and politics should be in the US. 
As a CS concentrator with no history background at all beyond high school AP US History, I was worried that this course was going to be inaccessible; my worries were completely unfounded. I learned so much about the interplay between science and from the nation's founding until the present day, and I was really surprised by a lot of what I learned. This course's interdisciplinary nature is what makes it accessible and interesting to so many different people with so many different backgrounds; I often found myself engaged in debate with my classmates about the merits of different work we read, and we often carried our conversations from sections while leaving section.
My only knock is that the readings can at times get quite long, and it's possible to get by during the semester without reading most of them in any sort of detail. I strongly discourage doing this though, as the readings are what enable you to really understand the arguments and the people behind what you learn about in lecture. Also, it's necessary to have a good grasp on the readings for the final exam, which is very reasonable if you spend the time preparing for IDs and did all of the readings.
Colin Bossen was a great TF, although I heard generally favorable things about the others as well.</comment>AVOID THIS CLASS! the first 2 lecturers on scopes aren't bad, you might be interested to know that christian fundamentalism is narrowly defined, BUT THEN leave this class!! Take a real philosophy class or the Darwinian Revolution. This class takes lots of subjects that are generally horrible, a few people were interesting (The pragmatists), but don't worry the discussion of them is butchered too. Nothing good will come of this class, even the paper topics are hilariously awful.</comment>This course was great. I did not attend lecture at all during the semester, which I feel may be a disadvantage on the exam, but only section readings were really required for the 3 essays. I loved the readings, they were really interesting. I'm a psych major so I wasn't used to reading historical writings, but I still enjoyed the course nonetheless. Mainly because I am interested in religion & society, but this was my first history course in college, and my first course on religion. My TF, John Gee, was great and really helped make this course awesome.</comment>The material for this course is quite interesting. Be prepared to read lots of primary sources and to take good notes in lecture.</comment>I thought this class was really interesting for the most part, although it wasn't always what I had been expecting. If you're looking for a class that focuses solely on the interaction between religion and science, you'll really enjoy the first part of the course (as I did), but then you might be a little bit disappointed as the course transitions into more of a discussion of the role of religion in the American public sphere. Professor Jewett is a decent lecturer, but some of his lectures were fairly dry, and they often move quickly so it's easy to miss important details. Two of the essay assignments were sort of weird, but they were all definitely manageable.</comment>Go to lecture. Jewett may have a slightly dry lecturing style, but the material becomes increasingly interesting.</comment>This class is an enjoyable and low-stress way to satisfy a general education requirement. It's actually pretty interesting and relevant. While it's not necessary to read all the assignments super carefully, the reading is pretty light and so keeping up with it (at least by scanning everything) is quite helpful.</comment>This class was a really cool way of looking at American history. I took this as a gen-ed not really knowing what to expect with a class about religion and science, but it was really cool. It ended up being a lot about politics and religion and science, but it really gives you an clear overall picture of America's changing views on religion and government in the context of the scientific developments of the last 200 years. I think a course with this kind of angle most definitely makes you a better citizen. Logistically on a day to day level, it was pretty painless. There were about 5 20 page readings a week and 3 papers and a final exam. The grading seems like it was based on your TF but  generally fair. The final exam was also fair and very helpful for that overall perspective. Jewett was a fine lecturer and was pretty enthusiastic.</comment>This course provides great insight into many moments of conflict between religion and history. However, the various movements we discussed felt disjointed, and I had a difficult time understanding how they fit together. Professor Jewett and Steven were both wonderful, and they clearly care about the subject matter and their students.</comment>A pretty good history survey class for those humanities students looking to fulfill US in the World. If you're a science kid, be prepared to understand that *this is definitely a history class* so don't fool yourself into thinking there won't be reading or response papers. Prof Jewett tries to make things easier on you by highlighting the parts of readings you should read, so you don't actually have to read through everything. Try not to skip lectures, but if you do, it's not the end of the world, because the papers are mostly based off the readings, and the final is based off readings and key terms he gives you. A really interesting survey of American history for anyone remotely interested in the narrative of religion in the development of the US; science is a part of the discussion, but only when in conflict with religion. Assignments include weekly 300-word responses, that unfortunately you don't get feedback on week to week, but they're pretty painless; and 3 5-7 page papers, that take a lot from the readings and are somewhat creative, which is nice. Not the *best* history class I've taken at Harvard, but enjoyable nonetheless!</comment>The title of the course is somewhat misleading: the emphasis is almost entirely on American intellectual and political thought. Also, as a (hard) science concentrator, I was surprised by the heavy emphasis on the social sciences (was expecting only bio/chem/physics for some reason). The emphasis on primary readings was also VERY heavy. That said, I now have a much better understanding of the strains of religious thought underlying and behind current and historical american politics. For example, when I took APUSH in high school, I never understood why nativism was a thing in early C19 America (it just seemed like really rude and racist xenophobia). But now, I realize that nativism was driven largely by anti-Catholic sentiment, which stemmed largely from Protestant fears that Catholics would be loyal to the Pope and undermine the free thought considered necessary for American democracy.</comment>Be careful, this course may not be what you expect.  If you come from a history background or are a history concentrator, this is certainly not like most history classes offered.  If your hoping this class will help you understand and reach a personal conclusion about the place of science and religion in society, it may not fulfill that goal either.  The course teaches a lot of specific intellectual history that some people will find boring, not stimulating, or simply not relevant.  That said, it is a moderately interesting examination of these often competing forces and if you are somewhat interested in either one you may find you enjoy this course in the end.  All things considered, I was really interested by the topic, but somewhat let down by this course's execution.</comment>The beginning and ending thirds were good. The middle third went pretty deep into intellectual philosophy which isn't really advertised in the course description. The readings for that section of the course are really dense and difficult. Overall the reading load was much less than it could have been thanks to Professor Jewett highlighting what we were responsible for in all the readings. There is definitely a minimal time commitment so it's a good class to balance the harder more work intensive ones. Your life will be a lot easier if you just read the reading when it is assigned. It is very doable and you will regret it come paper and final time if you don't.</comment>at times boring but overall worth it. very easy</comment>The lectures are wonderful, it is a joy to hear Professor Jewett discuss the material. At times funny, at times thought provoking, and at times downright shocking. Sections are alright, and the readings take careful attention. Difficult for those like myself without a background in history. Lectures ultimately make the class worth it, and the final was on the easy side of fair. I recommend, but just be ready for the high level reading required.</comment>The class was fine. Definitely not as good as the Q scores from last year said. Lectures were often pretty boring, although Jewett seems to be pretty cool. Section was awful and the feedback I got for my assignments never matched with the grade that I ended up getting. I wouldn't recommend this class, unfortunately.</comment>This isn't an easy GenEd by any means, but it covers some really interesting things. Readings aren't that bad - about 50-80 pages a week. It covers a lot of interesting philosophies; you might want to think of it more of a philosophy course that integrates history than a history course in its own right.</comment>This class starts off pretty interesting and actually ended interesting, but the middle was painful to get through. Professor Jewett seems really nice, and the first few lectures give a really interesting overview of science and religion in America (leading up to Darwinism), and then the class turns into intellectual history where we were pounded with 80 pages of philosophy that made no sense every single week. The assignments aren't long but they're odd and confusing, and it was often difficult to tell what the TFs wanted you to produce. It also definitely seemed like your TF significantly affected the type of grades you got in the course, especially since my TF (Colin) decided that he was going to give everyone worse grades with each subsequent paper. Overall, unless you're really interested in the development of the social sciences in America, I wouldn't recommend it.</comment>This is a good class. It's a very interesting way to look at American history and it's a good background for the debates we see today.</comment>This is a very interesting history class that examines some big questions about the roles of science and religion in the United States throughout history and today. The readings can be long but are usually engaging, and the important parts are highlighted. This is not a difficult class, but it is a good one.</comment>It felt somewhat scattered, we covered a lot of topics, but jumped from one to the next.</comment>The class is very very low workload straight up until the final. Because there are no midterms, it becomes very easy to not really do any of the readings along the way or only read the amount necessary to get through section response papers. My recommendation, if you're not going to read would be to take really really good notes in class because the lectures are also not online or in an annotated form after the class so if you didn't pay attention in class that's basically it.</comment>This class says it presents many different ways people have thought about science and religion throughout American history. It does this, and absolutely nothing else. Beliefs are barely, if at all, contextualized, and never critiqued. The teaching is uninspired, and all of the historical connections or critiques that might have made this class interesting are left untouched. As a result, this class is uninteresting.</comment>This course is a little strange. You start in media res with the Scopes trial, circle back to early American history, and then progress to contemporary society. Furthermore, the readings are primary sources related to the lectures, and sometimes only connect tangentially (well, maybe a little more than tangentially). All of this together makes it difficult to piece together a coherent account at times; however, if you stick with it and put in enough work, connections start to become apparent. It was very edifying to go back and skim the readings while studying for the exam, as the context was much clearer. Overall, a decent course (especially for Gen Ed): the lectures are interesting, the readings can be interesting, and section produced some good discussion. However, I did find section policies a little draconian (300 word response every week, additional 500 word responses for a missed section), although perhaps that is necessary in order to compel people to work in a Gen Ed class...</comment>Lectures were straightforward, but the material was repetitive at times.</comment>Neither the best nor the worst course I've taken at Harvard, I still can't help but think it was a bit of a disappointment. The material and subject matter are very interesting, but the course has trouble pulling everything together into something comprehensible and coherent. Even the longest readings aren't all that long, so keep up with them (and take notes) or else the exam will be unpleasant (you aren't held responsible for much until the bitter end).</comment>This was a fascinating class with course material that makes you think and question the basis of American society. Professor Jewett is an excellent lecturer, and he always brings in interesting stories that pertain to the lecture's subject that actually help you remember the real course material. The course itself is well-organized with exactly 25 lectures and set topics for each. History and science students both will love this course.</comment>Would not recommend unless there are serious changes to the syllabus- many lectures felt ungrounded and pointless. I didn't get a sense of an overall message.
Could be a good course for you if you don't like traditional paper prompts.</comment>This class is very easy, but very unstructured. The readings are not too long or difficult, and they are highlighted so you are only responsible for the marked sections. The topic is interesting enough, but you will be in charge of keeping up your own enthusiasm, which can be difficult after the first few lectures. The papers are not very difficult, and the final is very manageable, as you receive all of the possible IDs before the test. Section varies greatly, and that can really affect your class experience and how deeply you engage with the material.</comment>Excellent and very informative class.</comment>Lecture is awesome and engaging.  The readings can get very dull, very quickly, and can be hefty some weeks.  Papers are not hard and have interesting prompts.  Section, for me, was unsatisfactory and a chore.</comment>I have mixed feelings about the class. The first two weeks or so were great, and I was super engaged. However, there is no coherence to the course. As the semester goes on, it feels like more and more separate lectures on topics related either to religion, or science, or politics. Some of the lectures are fascinating, and some not so much. There weren't many parts of the course that I actively disliked, but there also weren't an abundance of times when I came away thoroughly satisfied.</comment>Primary readings only - sections OK - not much science involved, mostly religion and society in American history. Mostly old history.</comment>Great gen-ed and great class overall. Lectures were interesting and enjoyable. Essay prompts were creative and broad enough that you were never left writing about something you didn't understand.</comment>The course readings and lectures are individually interesting, yet do not combine to form a cohesive, understandable body of knowledge.</comment>This class makes you think in new ways about the society we live in today -- were it came from, how it fits into a much larger historical context. I recommend this class to anyone who is looking to learn more about the country's history, and/or interested in the intersection between science and religion.</comment>This class is an excellent way to fulfill the requirement for US in the world.  It has a decent amount of reading, but efforts are made it make it more manageable and the amount of primary sources make it quite engaging.  Start mapping out a timeline from the beginning of class though as it jumps around a lot.</comment>Take this class to hear a very interesting, unique and polished story of religion and science in American history. Prof. Jewett is a phenomenal lecturer and really brings his expertise and enthusiasm to class every day. TFs are knowledgeable and committed, readings can get heavy in some weeks but are by and large very interesting, essay prompts are very fun and give you a lot of freedom to explore things you like in the class. I went in with literally zero background in American history or religion and learned quite a bit. Highly recommend this as a way for non-Americans to satisfy US&W.</comment>This is a great class overall, but sometimes the lectures or readings are a little dry. Most of the readings in this class are primary sources written directly by the people we are learning about in the lectures. The sections were also enjoyable (but this could depend on your TF).</comment>This is a solid gen ed with a really interesting topic. It's not an easy gen ed, but come out with a good understanding of the interplay of science and religion in US history. Go to lecture; there is no way to get the material from lecture that's not in the readings unless you go. The essays are graded fairly strictly, but the final is straight forward.</comment>Not my favorite course, but better than what I expected from a USW Gen Ed.</comment>I ended up just not being that interested in the course, but it isn't a particularly easy gen ed. Final, 3 essays, and response papers every week. The reading aren't particularly easy to get through, and although they highlight the parts you are supposed to focus on there is a lot of sheer volume for a gen ed. Not terrible, but there are certainly lower work options if you have to take something you aren't that into.</comment>This course is a unique opportunity to look at this country in a way that we don't often talk about. You will definitely understand more about current events and problems in this country after taking this course.</comment>Interesting course, not too hard. Good for fulfilling culture and belief.</comment>Section is weak but interesting topic</comment>This is an interesting course in terms of the material that is covered. Prof Jewett is a good lecturer and presents the material well.</comment>If you're interested in the material, definitely take this course!  You can learn a lot without a strenuous workload.  Lectures can be dense (tons of info packed in), but assignments are enjoyable.  The final exam does cover a ton of material, so it's useful to keep up with the readings.</comment>This course will broaden your view of religion and the way it interacts with American society. Its approach is more critical than comparative, which gives students interesting intellectual opportunities. There's not a huge amount of work, with manageable (highlighted) readings and a few short papers, but it's all rewarding work.</comment>Readings are very manageable and not boring. Essays are also manageable and final is easy as long as you study. Professor is very approachable and makes lecture not boring also.</comment>This course fulfilled everything I hoped it would. It was an interesting exploration into a topic I was previously unfamiliar with but wanted to learn more about. The readings were very interesting and manageable. I do think that the section component of the course needs to be rethought though due to the size increase.</comment>This is an intellectual history course where you mostly read abstract philosophy about religion's role in psychology. The readings get progressively more dense. Many people I talked to felt tricked by the first few weeks into taking an intellectual history course.</comment>great survey of american political history of religion</comment>This is a great course. I found the knowledge / time-input ratio incredibly high (meaning you can learn a lot without having to spend too much time). In addition, the course material itself is very interesting.</comment>This course is what I've always wanted a general education class to be. It's works well even with having other more challenging courses, and this course is very interesting and compelling in itself.</comment></course>DRAMA 115: Acting Shakespeare</title>If you are at all interested in acting, especially if you enjoy Shakespeare, you should certainly take this class! Remo is a great teacher - he manages to create an engaging and low-stress environment which is conducive to learning and growth.</comment>If you love Shakespeare, if you love Remo, if you love performing, or if you think you might like any of those things but have not had the opportunity to try, this is the perfect class. You will learn far more than you could anticipate and the environment of the class hugely supportive.</comment>This is a great class to take if you're interested in learning more about how to approach Shakespeare's texts. If you've done a lot of Shakespearean acting, you might find that you've heard some of the stuff discussed in this class before. But even veteran actors can probably learn something from this class, because Remo gives very nuanced and detailed feedback.</comment>Remo is absolutely incredible. He completely throws himself into his teaching and expects you to bring the same level of enthusiasm to class as he does. The expectations for your performances get greater each week because it's a cumulative process of improving our technique, but I felt really accomplished and proud of what I understood about acting Shakespeare by the final class. I found the work we did to be actually quite challenging in the sense the you have to really push yourself to grow in a way that you cannot bullshit, but also incredibly empowering. If you are in the world of dramatic arts, you can't pass this opportunity up. The blog posts get tiring, but it's really minor busy work and a small price to pay for the attention and elite training that you get with Remo.</comment>Acting Shakespeare is the funnest class I have taken at Harvard so far. Even if you don't have much experience in acting or performance that's ok because you'll learn SO MUCH in this class, make great friends, and work with amazing teachers. TAKE THIS CLASS!!!</comment>Remo is so kind and knowledgeable, and makes sure that everyone, not just the person performing, learns from each performance. If you have any interest in acting, then you need to take this class.</comment>If anything, take this class for the incredible personal attention you get. I found it invaluable in my development both as an actor and as a student.</comment>If you like Shakespeare, you can't miss it. Remo is brilliant, no matter how experienced you are, you'll be challenged and you'll have loads of fun.</comment>This course is a rigorous introduction to Acting Shakespeare. Remo is an excellent teacher who meets you at your level and pushes you to go beyond it. This course also gave me much better familiarity with Romeo and Juliet, A Midsummer Night's Dream, and Hamlet.</comment>If you have an interest in acting in any genre, you should strongly consider taking this class before graduating. You will ultimately  develop a strong appreciation for how Shakespeare's text lends itself to being acted a certain way and you will be able to hone your general acting skills as well.</comment></course>PHYSICS 289r: Euclidean Random Fields, Relativistic Quantum Fields and Positive Temperature</title>The tradition witnessed here, of mathematical quantum field theory and in particular constructive quantum field theory, has been linked to Lyman since the 1960s. It is by no means a tradition that is closed -- certainly, I felt welcome there, though I was an unfamiliar face.</comment>I would recommend taking this class if you would like to see a new perspective on quantum field theory (different from standard QFT textbooks).</comment></course>FRSEMR 44w: The Masquerade of Common Scents: An Exploration of Ephemeral Knowledge</title>The class had the potential to be interesting, but it needs to be restructured to be more interactive. I really enjoyed the "specialty" classes, such as when we did an authentic Chinese tea ceremony and another when we smelled perfumes from the past 100 years. But other classes were just two hours of recapping reading, and I was often very bored.</comment>Definitely take this class. Fun, interesting, and the best teacher you could ask for in your first semester of freshman year.</comment>If you have any interest in smell, whether it be a love for perfume, a fascination with the scents of cooking, or just a general curiosity, this class will cover it all and then some.</comment>Good for people with a history/humanities focus!</comment>Take this class! It'll be the class you look forward to in your busy schedule.</comment>The professor is a very kind person, however discussions drag on and begin to feel like lectures at times.</comment>If you never thought about the importance of smell, this class'll open your eyes.</comment>This class was the highlight of my semester. The professor is so passionate and my friend who I convinced to sign up with me knows he owes me big time. Very little work, besides pondering questions surrounding smell and doing readings. TAKE IT.</comment>Take it!! It will actually change the way you see (smell) the world.</comment></course>PSY 2580r: Affective Forecasting: Research Seminar</title>The Gilbert lab is awesome! You work under a grad student on whatever line of research needs assistance. The expectations are totally fair and your designated time in the lab can easily be figured out to fit your schedule. If you're lucky like I was, though, most of your time will be spent outside the lab brainstorming/researching ways to test your hypothesis and creating experiment stimuli. There are weekly journal club discussions where every RA reads the same article(s) and you discuss them as a lab. This helped the lab feel like a community and facilitated everyone getting to know each other and their work. Finally, rather than write a paper, the Gilbert lab has each RA give a PowerPoint presentation at the end of the semester to show Dan and the rest of the RAs and grad students what they worked on. This was a great capstone to an enjoyable semester. If you're thinking about working in a lab at some point, this is a fantastic option!</comment>This is an excellent lab to be in if you are looking for a rigorous and hands-on, but extremely enjoyable experience with other great and highly motivated students. The lab grants students a lot more freedom than others on campus, but be prepared to hold your own and take a lot of initiative in the research process. Overall, I would highly recommend working here.</comment>Incredible learning experience along with not a huge amount of work load.</comment>Great course!</comment>If you hope to get a better idea of how psychological experiments work and would like to get hands-on experience with data analysis, this is the course for you. Also if you loved SLS-20 with Gilbert, this is a great opportunity to interact with him and gain even more of his wisdom.</comment></course>AESTH&INTP 58: Modern Art and Modernity</title>This class is a great introduction to modern art. The professors are amazing.</comment>it's very theoretical, be prepared</comment>If you are interested in art, I would highly recommend this course. You will never again have the opportunity to hear three brilliant art historians lecture on the works most fascinating to them. Further, the course provides a wonderful survey of modernity perfect to balance out a course load that may have very little cultural influence. The readings are not terribly difficult, the teaching staff is excellent at clarifying, and the material is incredibly diverse and interesting. You really cannot go wrong. Take this course and savor the exposure to modern art - you will treasure it well into adulthood.</comment>If you are at all interested in the fine arts as a viewer, this course is an ideal survey of modern art. It even provides a rational basis for why the derogatory notion of "modern art" has come to mean what it does, evolving over time.  If you are interested in one specific movement (e.g., Cubism), and less the rest, you might find yourself dissatisfied with the one lecture your interest receives.</comment>Be open minded about the art.</comment>Relations with teaching fellows and course staff matters just as much if not more than actual knowledge of the material.</comment>Take this course! It's a very cool overview of the major movements of modern art, and the readings and the textbook and the lectures are full of interesting claims from many angles. (So do the readings!) I came in knowing very little about 20th century art and the early start date (we began with Jacques-Louis David in the 1780s and 1790s) really helped to ease me into thinking art historically. I'm in biology, but I never felt like I could not write a good essay or ask good questions. Overall, one of the best GenEds I've taken at Harvard.</comment>I felt this class helped me learn to appreciate modern art and for the most part the readings and work were reasonable. I genuinely enjoyed the material. The exception was for the readings that were highly dependent on previous art knowledge. Also there were too many paintings to memorize for the final. And some lectures *cough Buchloh cough* were nearly impossible to follow. Unfortunately, essentially every lecture did not cover the paintings that they planned to cover.</comment>Awesome survey course. You'll learn a great deal.</comment>This class has amazing professors, and will provide you with a comprehensive overview of modern art. It would be a lot for someone who has no background in art history-- I found it more difficult than many HAA courses I've taken.</comment>Not the easiest gen ed, but an incredibly rewarding one. If you have any fleeting interest in modern art, definitely take this. You have the opportunity to learn from the authorities on the subject, which makes learning it so awesome.</comment>A fantastic class that really gives you on overview of art from 1720 to the present. Be prepared to learn a tremendous amount. Also, make sure you enjoy the art produced during this period. I loved everything up to WW2, but after that, having to learn about abstract expressionism, minimalism, conceptualism etc was pretty painful. The essays are fun and the exams are straightforward, you get out of it what you put in.</comment>I really liked this class.  It was a great survey of modern art and the assignments were interesting and fairly graded so anyone can do well in the class if you put in the effort.</comment>It is certainly interesting, but be prepared for some dry readings on some very conceptual and hard to understand (with no art history background) works.</comment>I took this as my first art history course ever. I loved it. This course fundamentally changed the way I look at objects. I can't wait to take more HAA courses.</comment>Fantastic lectures by Lajer-Burcharth and Gogh! Take this class. You'll learn so much about the most famous moments in the world of art between the French Revolution at the present. (Buchloh's lectures are good as well, albeit a bit difficult to follow)</comment>Be prepared to do a lot of reading and a lot of learning on your own.</comment>There are a lot of readings, and the exams require students to memorize many artworks and their dates of creation. That being said, I think I came out of the class with a much clearer idea of what the major movements have been in the history of Modern Art.</comment>This class is a blast if you care about art. Prepare to see art in a completely different fashion than ever before.</comment>Each professor has distinct lecturing styles, but all of them are incredible. They truly are giants in art criticism, and being in a class will all three of them was amazing. This class is definitely one of the best I've taken at Harvard, and as someone who loved going to art museums despite really knowing nothing about art, I feel like this class has transformed the way I look and think about art and just made me love it so much more. You know how people always say that the one art history class they took in college was one of their favorites/most important... so take this class!</comment></course>GOV 1796: Central Challenges of American National Security, Strategy, and the Press</title>This is my favorite class I have taken at Harvard. If you have an interest in foreign policy or America's role in the world, definitely take this class. If you are an undergraduate, the assignments will stretch you and make you think in a way you haven't thought before. I really enjoyed the readings and assignments. You will learn a lot from the other people in the class as each has a wealth of knowledge and a unique background. Professors Allison and Sanger are experienced, insightful, and willing to to get to know each student on a personal level.</comment>It's a great chance to put yourself in the shoes of the guys in charge of American foreign policy, to see if you could do any better...</comment>Anyone interested in national security ought to take this class. Highly knowledgeable and interesting professors and peers, important and engaging topics, useful assignments, and guest lecturers make this unlike most other classes you will take. In particular, Professors Allison and Sanger have a great dynamic due to their different backgrounds; you also often learn as much from the other students in the course, who include mid-career Kennedy students, national security fellows, and those with military backgrounds. Speak up in class. Do all the readings--it will make the cases much more meaningful. And take this course. You will emerge with a much better understanding of decision-making and some of the most pressing issues facing the US today; memo-writing skills; and spend a semester (or longer) in a great community.</comment>This course is fantastic at teaching you how to think about national security issues. Graham and David are hilarious balances to one another, and the quality of students in the class is also phenomenal. Can't recommend this class enough.</comment>This class is a must-take for anyone interested in international relations, national security and politics in general. We worked on up-to-date material, constructing strategies to deal with issues ranging from the defense budget to Iran and China. In one week we got to have skype sessions with Dr. Kissinger and David Petraeus. This class was one of the best two classes I have taken- I cannot recommend it enough.</comment>A great way to get up to speed with the current state of American security, and get in the shoes of the decision makers.</comment>This is a very difficult course but pass/fail is an option! Professors Allison and Sanger are extremely knowledgeable and very invested in the course. It can be intimidating to approach them because there is a very high risk of asking "dumb" questions, but they are very gracious and their wisdom is worth any minor embarrassment or shame. My recommendation would be to not be afraid to speak up in class when you have something meaningful to say - come with a couple points/questions prepared from the readings in order to ask questions of these two experts. The best part of the course is just receiving all of the wisdom they have to share - take advantage of it!</comment>This is an extraordinary course that will give you an opportunity to deeply understand the strategic challenges facing the United States and the difficult decisions that policymakers face every day. The course requires nuanced thinking, but it also requires the ability to write strategic options memos that convey your thinking in a very brief format.</comment>i've honestly learned more in this class than I have in any other course I've taken at Harvard. I can finally understand the issues that I'm reading about in the news at a deeper level. This course takes international relations beyond theory and reveals how national security decisions are ACTUALLY made. Although this course will stretch you beyond what you think you can do, you will feel very rewarded for pushing yourself. If you're lucky enough to be accepted into this class, TAKE IT!</comment></course>HIST 1997: The Political History of the Arab States Since Independence</title>Dominated by graduate students, may be difficult to keep up as an undergrad unfamiliar with the material.</comment>This course provides an excellent opportunity for students to become better acquainted with the history and contemporary politico-economic milieu of a widely discussed but poorly understood region of the world. Furthermore, its emphasis on independent research and writing is especially promising for students seeking preparation for a more intensive humanistic or social scientific course of study.</comment>Professor Owen is amazing.</comment>Be prepared for some reasonably high level discussion, and be prepared to contribute.</comment>Professor is great, very knowledgeable. Would consider taking another class with him</comment>Great opportunity to study with great professor, but paper is long and rather difficult</comment>This was an odd one.  Owen is definitely interesting, but talks a lot and slowly.  Also, it would probably be useful to go to his office hours.  Also, I think he is probably retiring soon or something, but if he does teach more, definitely go to office hours and such.  Also this course ignores Israel-Palestine.  Also, start the paper early!</comment>Professor Owen is a star, and he is very enlightening. This course seems targeted largely at graduate students, and you can expect that it will feel a little unstructured at times.</comment></course>FRSEMR 43m: Psychology of Religion</title>You will learn a lot and probably come out of the class with a new outlook on things. The class itself is very interesting and fun, and the professor is awesome.</comment>The class was fascinating at times, and less so at others, but on the whole gave me a ground up understanding of the psychology of religion, which is what I set out to understand.</comment>Really good professor.</comment>If you're looking for an actual psychology course like I was, this isn't it. The course focuses more on philosophy and existentialist discussions, where I was expecting more analysis of WHY humans biologically focus on a god figure, etc.</comment>Professor Boyd is extremely knowledgeable about the readings and very helpful in the class discussions. Be prepared to read about complex ideas, even some that you may not agree with, that will help you participate in a thoughtful and stimulating conversation.</comment>Definitely take this seminar if you are interested in psychology and the origins of religion. Dr. Boyd is a great professor and the classes/readings are always engaging and interesting.</comment>This class has about 100 pages of reading per week and a response essay due every Sunday night. That being said, you learn how to read and think differently and I think that it has prepared me well for other courses that I will take int eh future.</comment>The course will give you a new perspective on the society and the life at large. Take this course.</comment>Very interesting class if you want to know more about the religious mind and different reactions to religion and spirituality. You will get more out of the class by doing all of the readings. Take it because the psychology of religion is something that you want to discuss.</comment>Good course with thought-provoking material. Wes leads good discussions and the workload is light. a once weekly-discussion type course that was thoroughly enjoyable</comment>This was a great freshman seminar! The professor was funny and down to earth.  The readings were interesting (and short) and made for good conversations.</comment>You will get out of this seminar what you put in. If you have an interest in psychology and religion, this is the course to take... You'll tackle big questions, big authors, and big ideas.</comment></course>EXPOS 20.195: Dangerous Speech</title>You should be interested in court cases and laws. There isn't too much reading, especially in comparison to other Expos classes, but all of it centers around interpreting the laws and the nuances between similar court decisions.</comment>Dangerous Speech, unlike other Expos courses that I heard about from my peers, is actually a very fun and helpful course. I truly feel that the past semester has taken my writing from its lowest level and elevated it to a point where I feel prepared with any essay assignment for my future courses. It doesn't matter how "good" a writer you think you are, Expos will be beneficial for you, and I hope you will be able to take it in fall semester, because you *will* need the tools to succeed in the essay assignments for your other classes. Dangerous Speech has a uniquely interesting topic among Expos courses that is actually relevant to current events, as hate speech and how it reflects American attitudes is a hot topic in modern society, so the research and essays you will engage in during the class actually open your mind to other academic opinions that can influence your approach to other topics in future courses. I recommend this class wholeheartedly and am very glad to have taken it, which is something not every freshman can say about their Expos courses.</comment>This is a great section of expos! Very engaging lectures, really cool material, and interesting assignments.</comment>It's a great class if the you find the subject material interesting! Great for students who are interested in law.</comment>This class was an amazing combination of learning about free speech in America and learning how to write. It made writing fun and exciting because I was passionate about learning about the topic!</comment>This is a solid Expos class. The subject matter isn't too complex even if you have zero knowledge of the American legal system, and the workload is very manageable. The best part of the class is the preceptor: Jessica Ziparo is brilliant and approachable, and conferencing with her is a treat.</comment>Ziparo puts in a lot of effort into providing helpful feedback and organizing the course. The material is all relevant so there isn't that much unnecessary reading. Compared to other expos courses, there is much less reading. Good introduction to court cases and legal procedures. Don't expect too much in the content portion from the class directly but Dr. Ziparo is a great resource for information during office hours.</comment>Law is a difficult thing to write about, don't take this course unless you enjoy analyzing nuances.</comment>Topics are interesting and it has a lower workload than other expos classes.</comment>This course was a very enjoyable Expos course. I have heard many Expos horror stories, so I was worried when I entered my Expos course. However, my experience was great, as the topics we covered were very interesting and very thought-provoking. Our preceptor, Dr. Ziparo, was also really helpful, really understanding, and just a great preceptor in general. She really helped our class to have fun throughout the semester. However, to incoming freshmen, I would voice three words of warning, not about this course, but just on Expos in general: First, Expos takes more of your time than you think. Gauge Expos as a moderate to difficult course just for the sheer workload, rather than as an easier course. In addition, be aware of the difficult Expos grading scale for all Expos classes, where getting the grade you want is a very difficult task. And finally, if you don't do as well as you want in Expos, don't worry. Expos is hard for everyone, although some might not admit it.</comment>Do not take this class unless you are considering being a future lawyer or care a lot about free speech laws.  The first two essays focus very heavily on court cases (i.e. one is analyzing judicial court opinions and the second is writing an opinion yourself) and if you have no interest in the subject matter, the readings will be very uninteresting.  I get that these essays were meant to teach us how to write analysis and argumentative essays but they focused very heavily on the legal field and the logic and jargon associated with it.  That being said, the readings for this class are relatively short.  Dr. Ziparo is very nice and approachable.  She is always willing to help and gives very constructive comments.  Take this class if you are interested in the subject of free speech.  Otherwise, look elsewhere as it will not be a fun experience.</comment></course>SLAVIC 270hf: Mapping Cultural Space: Sites, Systems & Practices across Eurasia</title>Although this particular iteration of the class will never be offered again, in general these Davis Center seminars are good for interdisciplinary research and making connections with people from other universities and students and faculty in other disciplines.</comment></course>MATH 223a: Algebraic Number Theory</title>Number theory is a perfect playing-ground for algebra. Take this course to see this in action.</comment>This class is awesome, and Rapinchuk is a great instructor. We covered lots of ground, and the class totally made me excited for Math 223b.</comment>It teaches a few powerful techniques to answer questions that came up and seemed impossible in earlier classes. However, the class seemed to be mostly preparation for punchlines that will come in 223b.</comment>The class moves at a pretty brisk pace, but the material is fascinating</comment>A fine second course in algebraic number theory. Explains not only what adeles, Hilbert class fields, the Artin map, etc. are, but what the salient properties and uses of them are.</comment>Prof. Rapinchuk's courses are great - he's clear and teaches a lot.  The course didn't require a ton of time because the problem sets were rather short (I almost wished they were longer).</comment>This class is a great introduction to a very beautiful subject, where nice results are immediately accessible and almost everything seems to work out as you would want it to.</comment>As usual, class quality completely depends on the professor. Igor was an extremely clear lecturer, so I would recommend the class if he is teaching it (I would also recommend taking classes with Igor in general). 

As for 223a itself - if you liked Math 129 or are interested in modern number theory at all, you'll definitely like this course. We got to prove some amazing results (for example, we solved the x^2 + 14y^2 representability problem on one problem set).

One thing to watch out for is the fact that we do assume some black boxes (some of which are proved in the second semester), and it's hard to keep track of what we know and what we "know" (but don't actually know how to prove yet). In my opinion, keeping track of this was the hardest part of the course.</comment></course>SPANSH 70a: Heroes, Rogues, Lovers, Rebels, Saints: Voices from Medieval and Early Modern Spain</title>This is one of the best Spanish classes I have taken at Harvard. Dr. Gray is an AMAZING teacher. He is very knowledgeable on all of the readings and history, so the in-class discussion is very informative. He also gives great feedback on all the assignments.</comment>Although some of the works use slightly archaic vocabulary, the class is interesting and covers a lot of ground. I particularly enjoyed the fact that we anchored our explorations of the literature with the works' and authors' places in Spanish history. Professor Gray was extremely knowledgeable about the material, very accessible outside of class, and enthusiastic about teaching.</comment>Andrew Gray generates an immense amount of enthusiasm for the readings and makes the course thoroughly enjoyable.</comment>I think this was a great class to both practice Spanish and explore Spanish literature.</comment>This is a great beginner's Spanish literature class. If you still need to improve your grammar skills, Andrew will be understanding and supportive, though you may consider taking another class (maybe in the 60's) that devotes some time to grammar. For all intents and purposes, this is a pure literature class. That being said though, Andrew is a phenomenal leader-- he gives thoughtful feedback, and leads class through challenging discussions while being extremely empathetic to his sometimes struggling students. A great class overall!</comment>Before you take this course, look closely at the literature as the discussion revolves around the text. If you are interested in the lit from this period, definitely take this class! the discussions, while all in spanish, are accessible to non native speakers while providing opportunities for improvement. And Andrew is really approachable, so it never felt intimidating.</comment>If medieval literature isn't really your thing, then I'd recommend choosing another course if you can. The subject matter could be tedious to read and occasionally dry if the time period isn't necessarily your thing. If you DO like medieval subjects, though, then the class will be phenomenal to you!</comment></course>GOV 94is: Individual and Society: the psychology of how society affects its citizens</title>Kris-Stella is an excellent teacher and the course is really interesting. The readings are very interesting and the only really difficult task is the final paper.</comment>This class has definitely been my favorite one! Kris-Stella is not only as enthusiastic as you, but she is incredibly relatable and has so much knowledge to offer the class! The class is great because it really makes you think to understand and apply what is learned elsewhere in your life, which is where all the fun lies because its amazing to see how learning a little about psychology can help you really understand society and individuals as a whole. The information that you gain from the readings in this course is astounding! Definitely do the readings as you learn a lot from them and they are super interesting. Plus as a once a week course, it definitely does not require much work from you other than when the two papers are due or when readings are due (in any case you have a week to do them). Trust me this course will change how you look at the world and how you see people.</comment>This is a wonderful course. The topic is extremely interesting and applicable to so many avenues in life; this course does a good job in explaining at least the psychological foundation of many social structures and, in turn, how those social structures affect individuals' beliefs and behaviors. Kris-Stella does a great job of running class and class discussions were often fascinating. In addition, the course materials/assigned readings were almost always very interesting. The last essay was fairly long, but the rest of the course wasn't too difficult and the relative freedom in topic choice for the final paper was certainly nice and actually made it a fun paper to research.  Overall, great course.</comment>Kris-Stella is awesome! The two hour discussion per week goes by really quickly because all the weekly tops are so interesting. A very fair course. Definitely take.</comment>I would steer away from this course. Grading is overly harsh. However the readings were interesting. You are better off reading the books and articles in the syllabus in your free time.</comment>Kris-Stella was a wonderful instructor! She knew the material well and was incredibly passionate about the subject. However, it was often difficult to gage what the overall purpose of the course was. If you are interested in political psychology, take the course! If not, try exploring other government courses as you try to narrow down your interest within the concentration.</comment>Take this class! Your eyes will be opened!</comment></course>COMPSCI 224: Advanced Algorithms</title>Amazing class that was tough but rewarding. Would highly recommend for anyone with sufficient math background.</comment>We learned about lots of interesting algorithms, especially linear programming.</comment>I enjoyed the class as an overview to advanced algorithm. Prof. Nelson gives a clear, in-depth explanation of the topic and the lectures gave me a good grasp of most of the topic discussed. This year, the problem sets weren't great though I assume they will be redesigned in future iterations as I believe they were newly created for this year's course. There is a final project at the end, for which there really isn't that much time, since there's problem sets until two weeks before reading period. Overall, I'd recommend the class, especially if the last few rough edges can be worked out.</comment>It is a good course to get to know a wide range of works in theoretical computer science related to algorithm design.</comment>This is a challenging class. If you love algorithms and did well in CS124 it's a good logical next step. Keep in mind that these will much more abstract and you won't be actually implementing these algorithms as you might in CS124. But it's fascinating material and you learn about some pretty recent research that's being done in algorithms. If there's any change you'd consider doing research in algorithms, definitely take this course!</comment>It takes a lot of time but you learn many new and interesting things. But if you are that much not into algorithms, better not take this class. If you are into algorithms, then with no doubt enroll in this class.</comment>Material was very interesting, but problem sets were very difficult.</comment>Very enjoyable and useful if you intend to study or apply state of the art algorithms.</comment>This class is generally taught pretty well. The problem sets tend to relate to problems solved in papers somewhat recently, but Jelani provides enough hints that they're pretty reasonable.

For those who were interested in CS124, the main difference (apart from the fact that the material is more advanced) is the lack of coding assignments.</comment></course>FRSEMR 26z: What is Life?</title>Easy freshmen seminar. Only take if you have an interest in biology. Complements LS1a well.</comment>This is a really interesting and inspiring seminar to take your first semester at Harvard. It really opened up my mind to a variety of different aspects about the components of life. Professor Guidotti is a fantastic professor and you will always look forward to next week's seminar. Take this seminar and life as you know it may change.</comment>I highly recommend this seminar for all students interested in the sciences, because it really opens your eyes as to what biological, chemical, and physical properties govern the living cell. You get to learn a lot of ideas and concepts which you may never have heard about before, and which you are not expected to fully understand. Thus, this course is a great way to get exposed to the life sciences. Throughout the course, I was captivated by what was taught, inspired by the professor, and gained a better understanding of what I myself was more specifically interested in in the life sciences.</comment>Great seminar for anyone interested in pursuing the life sciences. Complements ls1a very well. Professor Guidotti is explains the material very well.</comment>This class is great for an interesting perspective about cellular activity and its role in sustaining life. Very interesting material taught by an incredibly knowledgable professor.</comment>This class has very light workload -- you only have to write a 200 word paper each week. The material is very interesting if you are into biology, and it is a nice and easy seminar to balance out your busy schedule.</comment>This course was interesting and easy to complete, but it does fill up a course space that could be used to attain concentration credit</comment>The seminar is a great way to see how all the biology one learned in high school applies to the cell on a larger scale.  I enjoyed learning and seeing the math behind different aspects of the cell, such as the average distance between molecules in the cell or the rate of diffusion in the cell of different molecules.  The seminar is great for anyone who wants a new perspective on biology because the small details and formulas are tied into a greater understanding of the intricate and complex environment and functioning of a cell.  One learns to appreciate the cell's ability to combine multiple processes and organization systems to create life.</comment>This seminar is fantastic! It is best for future hard-sciences concentrators, especially those interested in biology. This is not a philosophy course. The workload is very low and the class is mostly based around discussion and some lecturing, although every part of the class is still very interactive. Prof. Guidotti is incredibly friendly, approachable and brilliant. I highly recommend this class.</comment>This was a pretty good course. Also Guido is incredible.</comment></course>SLAVIC 156: Nabokov: A Cross-Cultural Perspective after the Cold War</title>Svetlana is a wonderful professor, and I really enjoyed this class. Even when she had to take a few weeks off for a medical procedure, she made sure we have very interesting professors to teach each week, and it was awesome to see the other professors' points of view as well! I loved the mix of grad students and undergrads in this course, because as an undergrad, I got to learn from a lot of really intelligent grad students in a very close-knit setting. She had all of us regularly present passages and our interpretations of them, and I ended up learning a lot from the other students as well! This class is great, and I am SO GLAD I took it!</comment></course>PSY 1305: Evolution and Cognition</title>It's a great class for anyone with a serious interest in how the mind works and how it evolved. The format is very convenient for busy students, as the lecture videos are well produced and easily accessible. I didn't attend class in person much, preferring to watch the videos instead on my own schedule and email the professor with questions.</comment>I believe this was a new course this semester, so I didn't really know what to expect. However, it was captivating throughout and I really learned a great deal that has made me rethink certain areas of psychology, as well as daily social interactions and even some of my own thought processes.</comment>Great material, awesome professor.</comment>Multiple choice can be tricky so make sure you are answering the questions with what the TF would like you to know and understand.</comment>It was jointly taught with the extension school so it was really difficult to feel like the lectures were anything more than a filming for the online students. I didn't do any of the readings (literally none) and the midterm took me 15 minutes. If you understand evolutions, that helps but I wouldn't waste your time with this class.</comment>A great psychology course that will help you understand a lot of modern human behavior.</comment>Even though it is tempting to skip lectures and readings, go to lecture and do the readings because the course is very interesting and you'll get the most out of it if you do those two things. I learned a lot about human nature in this course.</comment>Very interesting material.  Light workload.  Definitely worth taking.</comment>Enlightening, very easy class. Krasnow is sharp and clear, and this is a real easy introduction to new and exciting research.</comment></course>CZCH B: Intermediate Czech</title>This class is both extremely instructive, and extremely rewarding. Professor Tuckerova cares about her students, and does everything she can to make sure that all of us grasp the concepts. She is an excellent professor and is the reason why I continued with a second year of Czech. If you have any interest in taking a foreign language, you should consider this class.</comment>If you have a passion for language or would like to learn more about a powerful culture, take this course.</comment></course>ANTHRO 2855: Deep China: The Moral Life of the Person: What Anthropology and Psychiatry Tell Us About China today</title>Not very stressful and heavy class, but you can learn a lot from it.</comment>This course open a window to discuss what really matters in the contemporary China not only in a anthropology view, but a view of real thinkers.</comment>A class that will make your thinking more open and flexible.</comment>You can learn a lot from this course, even if you come from China. However, Prof. Kleinman is not very approachable, so be prepared to finish a research paper on your own.</comment>Definitely a great class.</comment>This course was life-changing. It introduced me to several new ideas that have deeply influenced my research on narratives of otherness. Professor Kleinman is deeply dedicated about what he does and has a wealth of experience which he willingly shares with the class. The space he managed to create was inspiring. Please do yourself a favor and take this class.</comment>The readings are amazing -- immensely readable and fascinating. They will expose you to a breath of interesting issues facing contemporary China, and uproot a lot of the misconceptions and preconceptions you may have about the country. Professor Kleinman will astound you with his insight into Chinese culture and his sheer knowledge of all things anthropology, social theory, and psychiatry. If you are interested in learning about social change in modern China, this is the place to be!</comment>Incredible depth and great readings.  Not much work besides reading a book each week -- I strongly recommend it!</comment></course>FRSEMR 23e: The Scientific Method: A Roadmap to Knowledge</title>This course will change your perspective and how you view the world around you. Professor Sackstein is incredibly kind and has such valuable insights.</comment>This course is great! Dr. Sackstein is amazing- he is supportive and enthusiastic. This is heavy in science research so beware if you are not into science or medicine.</comment>They should never read all assigned papers on the day before, or the day of, class. It is much easier to spread them out over an entire week.</comment>Professor Sackstein is very knowledgable. Pick his brain whenever you can. I found it to be a privilege to be in his class.</comment>This was my favorite course this fall and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone interested in learning how to think properly. Dr. Sackstein is an amazing professor; he will challenge you to examine the way you think and change the way you approach science and life in general, as he certainly did in my case. The works we discussed during the seminar meetings, including the papers by Karl Popper, Hans Krebs and Thomas Kuhn, are among the most interesting and insightful readings I have encountered.</comment>This class was extremely interesting and prompted to me think about the scientific world and the scientific community very differently. The professor was very engaging, and it is important to do all the readings, but some of the readings were fascinating. It is a lot of work for a freshman seminar, though.</comment></course>HISTSCI 129v: Ether, Atoms, Particles, and Politics: The Physical Sciences in Modern Society</title>One of he best classes I've taken at Harvard</comment>This is a great introduction to the history of science! I did not have a strong background in the sciences, but that was not a problem. This class introduces the changes in science throughout history, about the role science has played in society, while also introducing some of the most famous scientists and concepts.</comment></course>GOV 1730: War and Politics</title>This is a great class. The material is interesting, as are the lectures. There is a huge amount of reading, so it would be useful to know how to sift through what is often 500 pages in a week.</comment>A class to put in your schedule immediately.</comment>Be ready to read alot and be accountable for these readings</comment>This course focuses on war history mixed with theory but does not involve politics as much as I would have liked. If you are interested in specific war strategies, leaders, and technology, this course provides fantastic historical examples. It does not really study domestic or international politics during wartime, nor does it focus on modern warfare until the final three weeks.</comment>It's worth the work to take this! Prof. Rosen is amazing!</comment>This is one of the best classes I've taken at Harvard. I thoroughly enjoyed the professor, TF, materials, and other classmates--it was really what I was looking for in terms of a stellar elective. Not only is the course material fascinating and important, but also the course is extremely well-organized/structured, and the professor clearly cares about his students. I looked forward to the reading every week, and the lectures were usually the highlight of my day. Even if you may feel you do not know a lot about the material when starting the class, if you're the least bit curious about warfare, intelligence, and how they interact with politics, I encourage you to take 1730--it's absolutely worth it.</comment>This in an INCREDIBLE class if you're interested in the strategy, conduct and operations of war. Professor Rosen is a wonderful lecturer, and the readings are really interesting, although pretty extensive and time consuming. Its just two exams so its not too bad in terms of workload. I also highly recommend taking this after Professor Walt's Origins of Modern Wars in the spring. They're very complementary. Another great part of this class is that you study theorists such as Sun Tzu, Clausewitz and Kautilya and then their application to various wars.</comment>Personally, the subject matter was interesting enough by itself for me to really enjoy this class; I really wanted to take a military history course and, unfortunately, Harvard doesn't really offer that, so this is the closest thing. However, the heavy reading load and, to some extent, the way section is done would make me hesitant to recommend this course to many of my peers.</comment>Gov 1730 is an incredibly strong and polished course. Professor Rosen is one of those classic Harvard professors about whom you say, "you have to take a course from him before you graduate." His lectures are extremely engaging and dynamic, and his real experience in foreign policy provides a unique structural and theoretical perspective on historical events and the future of war. The simulation is fantastic - don't miss it! Most of us wished we had more of them! As a science major and a government secondary, this class simply made my semester. Take this class if you are at all interested in war theory and/or the political-military apparatus and how it works.</comment>If you are interested in the topic matter, certainly take the class. It is, however, a ton of reading and there are high expectations of your participation and work on exams.</comment>Prof. Rosen is great. Lectures are engaging and there are extensive opportunities to ask questions that really expand the discussion. Tons of reading, but you're in college, you should be able to deal with it and figure out what's important and what's not. There are no papers, just a midterm and final, so consider if that will make this a more stressful class or a less stressful class for you. I felt that David's teaching style made sections miserable and unproductive, but there are probably a range of opinions on this.</comment>The reading load is very difficult, but the class is really enlightening and interesting.</comment>If you're a history buff (especially interested in military history), take this class! Professor Rosen is an incredible lecturer with encyclopedic knowledge of wars. He highlights key theoretical concepts at the start of the course and helps you trace the development of those concepts through really fascinating historical cases. The reading load is heavy so not a class to take lightly, but definitely worth it.</comment>Be prepared to read A LOT. But when you fight through and find the right techniques it will be worth it. Truly novel view on war and politics.</comment>rosen is great! lectures are fascinating. make sure you keep up with the readings.</comment>This course will provide valuable knowledge about war and politics that can be applied to many other pursuits.</comment>This class is certainly very interesting, and the passion that Rosen brings to the subject each day is unparalleled. The workload is a bit ridiculous, and if you don't know how to quickly read through hundreds of pages a week and find the important bits for class discussion, you will struggle tremendously. An intimidating class, as it should be, given its difficulty and workload, but if you like the subject matter, there's no course at Harvard that will teach you more about war.</comment>Professor Rosen has prepared an impressive introduction to explaining why the wars of the past two centuries turned out the way they did, and how the consequences of each led to the beginning of the next and to where we are today. It is a rigorous but engaging course for those interested in the history surrounding one of the most fascinating activities of man.</comment>Herculean amount of reading.  Be prepared, but it's worth it.</comment>One of my favorite classes ever. David Howell was a demanding but supportive and ultimately effective TF. Rosen is an incredible resource, a great conversationalist, but a dry lecturer who needs to learn how to use PowerPoint. The lectures' dryness was the ONLY fault whatsoever with the class IMO. Yes the readings were long and many, but I thought they were all excellent and relevant. Exams were very tough but fair, so don't expect to coast at all.</comment>Take this class! Professor Rosen is one of the best professors I have had here in my four years at Harvard. He has such an adorable, approachable personality and is extremely knowledgable in his field and gives fantastic lectures. He literally just stands in the front of the room with no powerpoint and talks for 2 hours, and I am always fascinated and entertained, which is no easy feat. Class is never boring, and he taught us SO MUCH. I remember one week he got so passionate about what he was teaching that he got choked up while talking about racism and the Civil War and had to pause; it was such a powerful moment that you could hear a pin drop. He not only is an amazing lecturer, and expert in his field, but is also just an overall adorable person.

David Howell, the TF for this course, is literally the best TF I have ever had here at Harvard, hands down. At first, I think a lot of people were intimidated by him, but for the same reason that I love him: he expects quality, and he pushes us to produce it. Yes, he is intense, but in a good way. He is an excellent teacher and not just an expert in the subject (a common problem here at Harvard unfortunately) and teaches you not only facts, but how to think critically and how to study and retain information. I cannot stress enough how highly I regard and respect David. He also has a heart of gold and genuinely wants his students to do well, and is always accessible outside of class time and genuinely wants to know his students, which is also rare at Harvard. He always was putting together extended office hours and study sessions for us, which was wonderful. Rosen and David are such a dream team.

Lastly, aside from my fan-girling over the teaching staff, this is a great solution to the Government International Relations requirement. I had absolutely NO background with military/war history/theory, and I was hesitant about what to expect. The course covers a TON of material, a cool mix of history and theorists and readings from Rosen himself. I will say this: THIS CLASS HAS A HUGE AMOUNT OF READING.  But don't let that alone deter you from taking the course! It was hard for me, since I was in five classes this semester, but with three or four I would have been able to manage it.</comment>Gov 1730 us a challenging but rewarding examination into the theories of Strategy and War developed throughout history.</comment>SO. MUCH. READING. Also David is a great TF who really cares about the subject and his students (he goes out of his way to have extra office hours and be available for help--take advantage of this!!!), but be prepared for section: it requires significant participation and felt almost competitive at times. Lectures were fantastic--Prof Rosen knows his stuff, and the lectures never last the full two hours. When I actually managed to get through the reading and survive section, I really enjoyed the class--when I didn't have time to do the reading (which was a shame because the readings are generally pretty cool) I had no idea what was going on. Overall great class, but as a science major with significant lab and extracurricular commitments the amount of reading we were expected to do was totally unrealistic.</comment>For students who have an interest and general knowledge of wars and combat, this course will likely be easier and more interesting for you. I had hardly any knowledge of wars and I found it extremely challenging but also very interesting. I learned a lot in this class, more than most of my courses this semester.</comment>This is the best class I have taken. 

Professor Rosen will change the way you think about war, no matter what your interest in the field is. From policy wonk to ROTC soldier, we're all doing it wrong. Rosen takes you back to basics to think hard about strategy. 

The course centers around theory rather than the history of war, largely to its credit. By focusing on the ideas of theorists first, and then considering historical wars as case studies to test theory, Rosen creates a conceptual narrative, and walks through actual wars in a thoughtful, coherent way. Further, the course does not hold any one theory to be authoritative; instead, each represents a potential tool in the analysis of strategies. You can and will find excellent opportunities to shred the ideas of the greatest theorists. 

You will have to do a huge amount of reading to enjoy the course. There is no avoiding this and you should not take the course if you cannot keep up with the readings. 

The simulation was incredible, although it would be better if it could be longer.</comment>This course is difficult but totally worth it. You should make sure that this class is the class with your most work in the semester because you will need the time and you will want to take the time to devote to it. This is a great class to pair with a more general international relations survey course because then there ends up being a lot of overlap. Also, go to Professor Rosen's office hours because they will totally be worth it.</comment>This is by far one of the best classes I've taken here. Both Professor Rosen and David know so much about the topic and the history of war. They make the class enjoyable. It's one of those of classes where you actually want to learn and remember the information you are given. And even after the class, you'll use the knowledge you got for other things. 

The reading is a little heavy, but ask David to teach you how to deal with that! He has some great reading tips that'll really help.</comment></course>SOCIOL 158: Sex, Gender, Sexuality</title>This class is extremely interesting, relevant and thought provoking. Professor's Meadow's lectures are excellent. Take it!</comment>PSA: Sociology is not easy. I thought this class was going to be simple because I had heard that sociology was easy. I don't know if its just because I'm used to pre-med classes or what, but there were a lot of dense readings that went over my head and I didn't get above a Bplus on any of the papers. It was an interesting elective, but take it pass fail if you don't like writing papers.</comment>This course is super interesting, you cover a lot of different topics and examine different perspectives, all from a very unbiased point of view.</comment>This class will demand a lot of you -- there is a lot of reading, a lot of assignments, and the concepts at times can be quite difficult to grasp. However, I got a lot out of this class and I think the effort I put in was definitely worth it.</comment>It is low key kind of difficult but you will definitely get a lot out of it and it's super interesting. It will make you way less ignorant.</comment>This class is good for people who are willing to go in with an open mind and allow their preconceived notions of the world to be challenged. It is important to do the readings to fully understand the concepts but they are mostly engaging and definitely worth it. Additionally, I felt like the writing assignments were actually beneficial and not burdensome.</comment>The material is so relevant, it'll make you see things a little differently. In the ebst way.</comment>Great class and really interesting topic. Reading sociological papers provided a new perspective for me (a WGS concentrator who usually deals with literature). I wish there'd been more of a focus on intersectionality though.</comment>Seriously. This class covers the intersection of race gender class ability etc. It is very important everyone everyone everyone takes this class.</comment>I thought this class was interesting, section was fine, readings were interesting. Readings can be dense but they get unpacked enough in section and lecture that you can still write a good essay if you just skim read. I found this class really easy, and it made a nice balance to my pset heavy schedule. I was already radical in my beliefs about sex, gender, and sexuality, so I can't say this class changed my perspective all that much, just reinforced beliefs I already had.</comment>Extremely interesting material, makes you realize how many things in your life have no more basis than the fact that that's the way you were taught to perceive the world. You won't get bored.</comment>This course was incredibly enlightening. The assignments were 100% transparent, i.e. do the readings and you will have no problem. Professor Meadow asks for students' opinions in lecture, and she has a great attitude overall. There many, many readings-- so I would recommend reading for key themes and not for thoroughness. Lecture, section, readings and assignments are so well integrated hat if you fall behind on one or two readings each week, you'll have multiple opportunities to get the information. An interesting course with fascinating course material that's directly applicable to daily life.</comment>This is a great class for sociology students with little to no background on WGS topics. If you are a WGS student, this class probably won't give you much. Assignments are clear, lectures are well-executed, and readings are interesting. However, there is a lot of hand-holding that may be frustrating for anyone who knows the topics at all.</comment>You talk about homosexuality, gender, and sex. If you're not interested in making these concepts academic, then don't take this. Otherwise, pretty interesting material. You learn how straight guys seek sex on Craigslist and still claim they're straight. Who knows?</comment>Prof. Meadow did an excellent job of making complex gender/sexuality theory accessible for individuals who may have never taken a WGS course; at the same time, I (as a WGS concentrator) still feel like I learned loads about effective and appropriate ways to qualitatively study this kind of stuff. Overall, this is a really great course. Seriously, I think everyone at Harvard should have to take it.</comment>This is an outstanding course, which really changed the way I looked at sex, gender, and sexuality-- and the interactions between them. Tey Meadow is an outstanding professor, very smart and opinionated. It was a pleasure to have her lecture twice a week. That being said, this is not an easy class. There is a lot of (great) readings, but I guarantee that if you take the time to read those texts, you will benefit greatly from the course.</comment>There are a lot of papers, but they are not difficult. This is very applicable to real life and therefore very worth it.</comment>The content was incredibly interesting and the lectures were extremely engaging. I actually liked completing the assignments. It is not a tremendously difficult course, but you will get a lot out of it.</comment></course>JAPAN 130a: Intermediate Japanese II</title>If you want to become better at Japanese, have fun doing it, and meet the kindest and most compassionate instructors ever this class is an awesome pick.</comment>You will regret not learning Japanese at Harvard because it is such a well-run program. I've learned more than I ever could have self-teaching (which would've probably failed miserably). I can understand snippets of real-life speed conversations in the media and make out basic news articles!</comment>The course is enjoyable! I came into the course after doing PII over the summer--so jumping from first year to third year. And I have to say, it is quite a jump!  If you are thinking of skipping into 3rd year, you MUST buy and study Shingu sensei (2nd year sensei)'s textbook. Study the kanji, and brush up on small bits of grammar that may be different from PII/HIF/KCJS.  If you do that, the first three weeks are far less of a struggle bus.  As for the class, Yagi-sensei is cool and Maekawa-sensei is very nice--the class is well organized and while there is a lot of homework, it definitely improves your writing and reading skills a ton.</comment>-Lots of interesting material covered that you wouldn't otherwise be able to tackle in Japanese.  -Instructors are ready to help you when you need it.  -Very challenging but this makes it rewarding. -Relative for real world interactions and readings in Japanese.  If students do not this course to be exceedingly difficult (which it was for me), students need to have all the kanji/vocab/grammer from Ba/Bb and 120a/b MEMORIZED well. If not, you will struggle though you can get through. Especially if you are coming off a summer doing second year abroad, make sure you put in A LOT of time memorizing all of the 120a/b material.  On the whole, I'm very happy I took the course. My Japanese has improved a lot and I am much more confident in my ability to work through Japanese texts.</comment>It is just a lot of work which makes the student face the fact that advanced language courses are not relaxing course but rather pretty stressful and demanding ones.</comment>This is definitely a step up from 120. If you are sure you want to continue learning Japanese, definitely take the course because it teaches you a lot.</comment>This class really helped by allowing us to engage with articles and improve our argumentation skills in Japanese through our discussions in the first and third units. Yagi-sensei also delivers the material in an easy-to-follow way and helps with overall reviews at the end of grammar lectures. Maekawa-sensei's sections also helped immensely by having us practice each unit's grammar structures and showing us just how many different structures can be applied to similar situations.</comment>Yagi-sensei is a hilarious teacher!</comment>study study study. lots of reading. dont let the first 3 weeks stop you from taking the course. It gets better. or at least you get used to it.</comment>You know this class is in the Japanese department and thus you know it will be nothing but exceptional. Yagi-sensei and Maekawa-sensei are absolutely the best and I know that my Japanese improved tremendously because of their guidance. They are both talented and caring teachers, as well as being very cool to just talk to outside of class because they're always available. I have no criticisms for this gem of a class. You not only learn more grammar and vocabulary but you get to apply them in real discussions about real issues.</comment></course>COMPSCI 207: Systems Development for Computational Science</title>Coming in as a physics concentrator, this was the first CS class I've taken that has been directly relevant to my field, and yet was still accessible outside of it. It wasn't an overly difficult course, Cecka was a great lecturer, and the psets were all very interesting. I honestly think that it made me a better programmer, and the tricks I learned with C++ were amazing. I would recommend this course to anyone, physics or not, though I would say that it makes life a little easier with a background in C (which most undergrads here would have anyway).</comment>This is a good class if you want to learn about C++. You'll learn a lot about C++ abstraction and do amazing things with them.</comment>This is a very useful course, but you MUST have some previous experience with C++. This was actually my third attempt to take the course. The first time I realized after the first lecture that I wasn't ready, having only done Python and very basic C before. I did some preparation and tried to take it again the following year. I struggled with the first problem set, but got through it. Then I read the 2nd problem set and dropped the course. I then worked on a code base in C++ and picked up a lot of the basics before trying again. I finally felt prepared, and while it was still challenging, I learned a ton and it was very rewarding. 3rd time's the charm, as they say.</comment>Need to take some c++ before taking this class.</comment>This class will make you a C++ god, and you will build really awesome projects. Be prepared to put a ton of time into it though. Also Cris is a fantastic teacher. He's incredibly passionate about coding well, and very funny.</comment>Its kind of a lot of work. Sometimes tedious. Lectures not always relevant to class work.</comment>This class is amazing.  Cris is wonderful.  That said this course is HARD: some psets will absolutely own your life, and the midterm was insanely tough. Having experience with systems and algorithms definitely a must and having C++ experience makes it a lot better.  You will vastly improve as a programmer after taking this course.  Hopefully Cris keeps teaching it: he is amazing.</comment>Great class to improve C++ skill. The materials taught in this class are very specific to C++.</comment>Make sure you have very good background in C++ and algorithms and data structures, or else you will suffer a lot</comment>But come prepared.</comment>This class is incredibly challenging, and will likely be very different without Cris teaching it next year, but I found it to be one of the most rewarding classes I've taken at Harvard. I recommend that any CS concentrator who wants to learn how to write production code and fundamentals of software design take this class as early as possible.</comment>CS 207 with Cris was awesome. It's a chance to focus a semester on developing your software engineering skills, which will go a long way in my opinion. The highlight for me was the problem sets, which begin with a lot of starter code and gradually wean you off so you are designing large portions on your own. The theme of the problem sets is a graph class which gets used to model water flow, rubber cloths, and a Poisson equation solver. If the same problem sets are kept next year, I would highly recommend 207, but unfortunately Cris is leaving so the course will be a bit different.</comment>Take this course if you want to learn more systems programming after CS61, if you want to learn C++, or if you just want a good course in general!  Cecka is a great professor and lecturer, and this class will force you to not only become acquainted with high (low) level concepts, but also force good programming habits on you.</comment>Definitely kept my programming sword sharpened. I actually enjoyed most of the course, and the visualizations that resulted from our code were a great way to feel extra satisfied with yourself. That being said, I felt that a lot of the course was quite "fluffy", and much of the thinking that went into design patterns, loop invariants, representation functions, and abstraction functions seemed unnecessary to me. Maybe I'm just too inexperienced, but damn I was bored.</comment>I may never have taken this class were it not a requirement for my S.M. program. That would have been a shame, as it turned out to be the most useful and engaging class I have taken at Harvard so far. This course teaches very useful software engineering and computer science fundamentals that make you think very critically about the code you write.</comment>Hard C++ course with design focus</comment>This class takes a lot of time, make sure you have that time.</comment></course>BE 110: Physiological Systems Analysis</title>Go to lecture and afterward, go over the material on your own, learn on your own first then come to class.</comment>The section component and office hours are life-saving. Utilize them.</comment>This class was pretty awful, although not terribly difficult. This is actually quite a shame, as it is a required course for bioengineering and covers a topic many students would genuinely enjoy if the professor were better. The material was interesting but lectures were tedious and not helpful. The problem sets had little to do with lecture material, and the professor plainly didn't care about the class so it was never clear to either the students or the course staff what we were expected to know. All of the readings were years old so they often didn't relate to what was being taught this year and a few were littered with crucial typos. Although the head TF was very nice, her section was also not very helpful. The two midterms were easy but 35% of the final covered information we were explicitly told in lecture was "just for context" and that we were not responsible for. Quite frankly, it seems after nine years the professor is no longer interested in teaching this class and the department should find someone else to teach it.</comment>If your bioengineering you have to take it so that's that. The material is good if you like the stuff, but the class leaves a lot to be desired.</comment>While the material itself is not extremely difficult, the course staff seems to range from disinterested to disorganized, making the overall experience very frustrating. However, seeing as it's a concentration requirement for the SB in bioengineering, you may have no choice but to take it anyway.</comment>For one, the "design project" is not really a design project at all. The assignment is to take a theoretical, arbitrary unstable system and stabilize it with very arbitrary constraints - to many, it seemed like a way for the bioengineering program to satisfy the ABET accreditation's requirement for engineering courses to have "design projects." I, along with many, do not feel better equipped to become an engineer in the real-world after going through this project or course.

Secondly, while the course material is interesting, it barely scrapes the surface for useful information - we learn how to stabilize systems simply by using proportional feedback, but there is a wealth of information that is not touched upon (e.g. PID controllers, lead/lag compensators, etc.).

Thirdly, the course is disorganized - the notes used for lecture were outdated and contained mistakes that have not been corrected for several years. The head TF was not helpful at office hours. Review notes by TFs contained mistakes. Support material for exams were missing - for example, three practice exams were supplied for the final, but only one of them, way back from 2007, had solutions.

Unfortunately, this is one of the requirements for BME/bioengineering, and you will have to take it in order to complete the degree. If you want to have a say in your education, you can suggest to SEAS/course staff to make improvements in the aforementioned areas.</comment>BE110 is a necessary challenge for bioengineers -- don't take this otherwise. The class is taught in a fairly non straightforward manner, and it felt as though we superficially learned a lot of the material without any deep intuition of what we were doing.</comment>This course is easier than ES 53, which is not really needed as a prerequisite. You should however has taken linear algebra because the course is all about linear algebra and solving equations. It is mostly a math course, with some physics and even less biology. Overall totally do-able and enjoyable.</comment>Don't take this class unless you're required to. Merfeld is really nice, but he's an awful teacher.</comment>While the material is challenging, if you go to all the lectures, pay attention in class, and read the textbook, you will find that the class is doable. The professor is very good at lecturing and presenting the material in a coherent and clear manner that is easy to follow.</comment>Okay, I'm going to try to make this section as constructive as possible but it might be hard. First off, I'll say that in terms of what you're actually required to know, the class is not difficult. The problem is, a lot of material is thrown at you but almost none of it is taught well so the class seems difficult and daunting before psets/exams because you have to essentially learn everything that you need to know (which isn't actually that bad, if you have good TFs - but that's not the point of a class). The biggest issue I had with the class, was that it felt like "plug and chug" with little understanding or actual learning required - and most of the time a question was asked about what something meant the only answer we got was either "don't worry about it", or we would get half an explanation followed but "just trust it". The course sounds cool and the material would actually be interesting material IF you have to actually learn and learn how/when it is used. To be honest, all the time I spent on this course felt like I was wasting my time because I didn't feel I was getting anything out of it. I think I can honestly say that this is the worst class I've taken at Harvard so far and I really hope it changes in the future, because it does have great potential. Professor Merfeld is a very nice and friendly person but I'm not sure he is the right person to be teaching this course anymore, I think it needs someone who is more excited by the material and wants to challenge their students but provide them with knowledge that will last. In the very least, I think this course should not be a course requirement.</comment>The material covered by this class is awesome, but there aren't many resources for actually figuring out what's going on beyond the surface level.</comment>The material covered in this class is useful, but the way the professor teaches it isn't. You need to have a good teaching staff in order to succeed in this class because the professor doesn't cover the material needed to do well on psets or on tests. Class lectures are also incredibly dull - it's hard to stay awake.</comment>This course may seem intimidating at first, but the assignments and exams are very fair. The course is taught at a higher level than is actually expected of you. The TFs for this course are also a great resource if you feel that you are overwhelmed by the material.</comment>DIFFICULT, but not because it has to be... the material itself is interesting, but the course is taught in a way that overcomplicates concepts and makes it difficult to understand which are important and which are simply details.</comment>This class is a basic systems class with some physiological applications. I think it is well designed for a biomedical engineering student.</comment>Only take it if your concentration requires it.</comment>You pretty much have to take this class. Bite the bullet and work with your classmates and TF's. Its a bit hectic without real sections, but the teaching staff is always there to help you with the material.</comment>Control theory is interesting, and while Professor Merfeld seems to be very enthusiastic about the subject, I do not think he was very good at relaying the knowledge he knows to his students. After you understand a concept, it actually seems pretty simple, but the class makes the process to understanding the concept incredibly muddled and difficult.</comment>Good class with cool material. If in the beginning you have no idea what's going on, don't worry that's normal. Things start clicking around week 3.</comment></course>HEB 1495: The Head</title>This class is a great way to fulfill the Junior Research tutorial requirement. The research project that we have to conduct over the course of the semester is a great way to get introduced to writing a research paper and conducting one's own statistical tests.</comment>You will learn a lot about conducting your own research and about thinking critically about data and evolution</comment>Come to class prepared because class time is devoted entirely to discussing the previous week's readings. You're a fish out of water if you don't read. Also, take advantage of office hours with the instructor because she's very supportive. She will help guide you through assignments if you have questions.</comment>Great class with interesting assignments. Prof. Zink kept the class fun and exciting.</comment>A ton of information is packed into this course. The work does not let up all semester. One project or presentation just transitions into the next. Katie is a great instructor, but don't be fooled by her nonchalant attitude toward some of the assignments - they are all graded exactingly. This being said, I feel that I learned a lot and had an enjoyable experience overall. Hopefully the next iteration of the course will include more current literature as planned so that you won't feel like you're drowning in the Lieberman textbook the entire semester and attempting to memorize trivia and minutia.</comment>It's a great, relatively painless way to knock out the Junior Research Seminar Req.  I think the course is going to be changed a bit so that "The Head" isn't the only text used, and with that change I think the class will only improve.</comment>This class is the best way to fulfill your junior tutorial requirement for HEB. Professor Zink is amazing and it gives you great exposure to what research in HEB is and looks like. Take this if you are uncertain about writing a senior thesis or pursuing a PHD.</comment></course>EXPOS 20.276: American Criminals</title>The course material and the preceptor's individual feedback were quite interesting and helpful. Class time was spent more discussing American Criminality, and less writing. I enjoyed the discussions, but when writing papers felt I could have had more instruction.</comment>This class maybe good for an expos class but you will improve your writing little.</comment>It is barely about criminals</comment>take advantage of the conference draft thing, great comments, great conferences</comment>For an Expos course, it's not that hard. It also improved my writing significantly.</comment>American Criminals is such an awesome class! The content is very engaging and the preceptor is super nice and helpful!</comment>Lindsay is great, and this class has more interesting writing assignments than other expos flavors. Definitely a good choice.</comment>As expos classes go, this one isn't bad.</comment>Just get through it. Expos is rough, but you'll make it.</comment>You just have to take it and there isn't much of a choice here</comment></course>FRSEMR 24e: The Physics and Applied Physics Freshman Research Laboratory</title>So relaxed and extremely engaging! We each had separate group projects (I was in the Music group), and at the end of the course had a presentation. What I loved the most was that since this was a Pass/Fail freshman seminar, I could really focus on the exploration aspect of the course and less about whether I'm getting an "A." The people at the Rowland Center are extremely helpful and so happy to have the students around.</comment>It was a wonderful way to get exposure to physics and lab research, and we had lots of access to lab resources and mentorship.</comment>Take it. You won't regret it</comment>Professor Golovchenko values scientific curiosity. He will explain you anything which you cannot understand, so you better ask. It is a rare opportunity to be able to build and think about physics with such a demi-god of experimental physics that loves to answer any question.</comment>Be prepared to be confused... but it's a fun course.</comment>Almost no work outside of class, but the location is far away.</comment>This class was my favorite of the semester because it allowed us to engage physics and engineering in a hands-on and supportive environment in which we constructed real things and received feedback and discussion points with Professor Golovchenko and the staff of the Rowland Institute. The end of the year presentation to a small group of scientists was also very rewarding and taught me how to address the scientific community with a presentation of my work. This class wasn't just amazing, it was useful and meaningful to pursuing science after college.</comment>I would say that the seminar could be interesting at times, but was not what I had hoped. I would make sure that you are incredibly enthusiastic about the topic before deciding to join as the time spent watching various machines work can definitely become monotonous.</comment>You'll get what you put into this class, which could be quite a lot. There are great resources (both people and facilities) at the Rowland, and it's a great experience for freshman fall.</comment></course>HIST 82l: The French Revolution</title>This has probably been my favorite course at Harvard. Professor Higonnet is fantastic. He's funny, witty, and extremely smart, and he clearly loves sharing his knowledge of the French Revolution. The reading can be somewhat substantial, but the focus of the course is on thinking critically about new ideas rather than "busy work" assignments. Hannah is also a great TF and provides great support with the final paper.</comment>A fantastic class if you're looking for an in depth study and understanding of the historiography surrounding the French Revolution. Anyone can read a summary of the events, but this class really digs deep into the questions the revolution raised, and continues to raise to this day. The readings are varied and all very interesting, and have all been carefully chosen: I could always see how a reading fitted into what had been discussed in class, and how it offered something new, which is great. The seminar was less of a discussion, more of a talk by Professor Higonnet, but his knowledge is phenomenal and it was a privilege to learn from him. I believe he is retiring after this semester, but if this isn't the case and you're interested in the French Revolution, you must take a class with him. Hannah is one of the most supportive TFs I've ever had, and wasn't afraid to diagree with Professor Higonnet (their arguments in class were wonderful to watch). If you're looking for a survey of 1789-1794, this isn't it. If you want to really challenge your thinking and attempt to truly understand one of the most important events in world history, then take this class.</comment>This is one of the only courses offered in Harvard devoted to the study of the French Revolution, so for that reason alone I would recommend it. The actual course itself could be structured better: be aware that almost your entire grade will be dependent on the final paper. Ultimately however it was effective in making me feel like I learned some of what there is to know about the French Revolution.</comment></course>PSY 1950: Intermediate Statistical Analysis in Psychology</title>Patrick is a great instructor-- he makes all the topics very approachable and provides you with practical skills to use immediately.</comment>Without hesitation I would tell future students to take this class.</comment>Modern methods presented by a statistician who cares deeply about teaching—what more could you ask for?</comment>Patrick is an excellent instructor who understands that students take this course to improve their research and works very carefully to provide course members with the tools they (as individuals) need to develop their inferential skills. The course is carefully designed and suitable for people with varying backgrounds. It can be more or less demanding depending on the amount of effort the student is willing to put in, and commensurately more or less rewarding. It is programming heavy and students who are not already R experts will leave with significantly improved R skills.</comment>Great class! One of the best</comment>Very useful!</comment></course>HAA 275w: The Thing</title>It will change the way you think about the subjects of your research for the better.</comment>somewhat more geared toward modernists, but constructive regardless</comment>This was one of the best classes I've taken at Harvard</comment></course>EXPOS 20.060: Interpreting the Civil Rights Movement</title>Interesting material, definitely useful for learning to write about history.</comment>Overall, the course is great. Professor Liazos is engaging, as she always asks questions that inspires meaningful discussion in class and makes an effort to connect the material learned in writing to all other disciplines students may need to write in the future. The knowledge gained in civil rights is minimal: the first paper deals with set primary sources on famous speeches, the second with a provided secondary social science paper, and the third research paper left to any topic loosely related to civil rights. The class is strucutured so that you may learn civil rights if you truly want to, or you may simply focus on writing skills with the civil rights movement as a simple background to your work.   I highly recommend it as an Expos course because, despite the workload, it develops your writing skills significantly. I now feel prepared to take on Harvards most challenging humanities courses.</comment>Even if you are not interested in civil rights or black history, you will definitely have a great time in this class. The preceptor is very helpful and supportive, and the writing assignments incorporated different writing styles.</comment>You don't have much of a choice for Expos, but this is a good and interesting one. Too much focus on Birmingham earlier, but the creativity allowed in the third paper makes it a good class. You have to like History to like this class.</comment>You will be bored out of your mind. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.</comment>In comparison to other expos classes, it is far more work in between papers. However, you will most likely be more prepared for future endeavors.</comment>At the end of the day, any EXPOS class you take is a writing class. It is a not a class solely devoted to the subject you chose. So, as a recommendation take EXPOS in a subject you like because if you do you are more likely to enjoy the subject material you are able to read and enjoy writing about the subject. Therefore, if you are interested in the Civil Rights Movement chose this EXPOS. If not, chose another.</comment>From what I hear, compared to other Expos classes, this one is a bit tougher. I learned a lot, but I won't know how much of an impact that has on my writing until the future.</comment>If you enjoy the civil rights movement, this is the class for you.</comment>This course is an interesting look at what the field of sociology looks like at the same time that it allowed me to explore a subject I'm passionate about, the civil rights movement. The trouble with it was its timeline, which was sporadic. However, if you can manage to stay on top of the work, it is manageable and interesting.</comment>Do not take it. I got stuck in it because it fit my schedule, but I would highly recommend that you not take it. If it's not something that interests you its very boring and repetitive.</comment>Your writing will improve, but this course is very time-consuming compared to other Expos classes.</comment></course>VES 21s: New Grounds: Painting Course</title>Absolutely everyone should take a VES class while at Harvard and this class is perfect because it doesn't require any sort of background in painting. We covered all of the basics and the assignments were versatile enough that everyone more or less found a type of painting they liked the most. It was a really great experience and I couldn't recommend it more highly. Both Matt and Chappell were really supportive and they made the class enjoyable for everyone.</comment>If you want to get better at painting there is no better way to do it than painting nearly daily.</comment>This class is a fun way to explore a new field, but be warned: it's a LOT of time. Painting is a lot more fun than writing papers, but in terms of time it's like having a 5-6 page paper due every week. Take this if you're willing to really commit a significant portion of your semester to it. That said, Matt and Chappell are the nicest prof/TF team I've ever had, and they really want you to do well in the class.</comment>This is a great introductory painting course that balances the structure of assignments with the freedom to create unique paintings. Matt Saunders is an incredible teacher who is quite hands off. He has a great eye and has insightful things to say if you ask him. This class requires you to complete a painting outside of class every week, so if you will not take the class seriously, do not take it. That said, it is accessible to all skill levels, from beginning to experienced painters.</comment>Fantastic opportunity to fall in love with the material and conceptual process of painting. Each week focuses on a different subject matter - interiors, landscape (favorite class was doing cloud studies on the roof), the figure. Makes you reconsider what makes "good" art. If you are self-motivated and can think of nothing you'd rather do than spend a good chunk of your week in front of an easel then this is a great way to really figure out the process of painting for yourself and become more confident in your ability to create art.</comment></course>BIOPHYS 170: Quantitative Genomics</title>If you are interested in learning population genetics, there must be a better class elsewhere. The selected scientific publications read in this class, however, were excellent.</comment>The course material for this course is interesting, but there are a lot of factors that make this course a very inhospitable way of learning it. Lectures were very scattered, disorganized, and difficult to follow; no lecture notes are made available online; assignment due dates remain mysterious and unannounced until very shortly before their due date; assignments as announced at the beginning of the semester are not necessarily the assignments you'll complete (we were told that we'd have 3 problem sets but only had 2); the schedule for journal clubs changes frequently; assignments that are required (specifically, providing responses to journal articles before class via an online google doc) are not made available until mere hours before the due date; and, finally, we never got a single grade back for the entire course. A few of these logistical difficulties would have been tolerable, since the course material is so interesting, but after a while it just got so annoying that I started to regret taking the course. Take this if you're interested in the material and can tolerate this level of disorganization in a course; if you can, it's probably worth it.</comment>- course is very disorganized - material is not particularly interesting and also rather unrigorously taught - don't expect your psets to be graded - lectures are often uninspiring</comment>This class is a waste of time that our program requires us to take. Maybe with a better professor something valuable would be learned.</comment>It's an interesting class with good material. Hopefully it will be better organized in the future.</comment></course>ENG-SCI 137: Energy within Environmental Constraints</title>This class was very disorganized and there was not enough communication to know what was expected of you as a student. Although it was the first year this course was offered, it was still much more disorganized than it should have been, and it is likely not to be any more organized next year.</comment>This is an awesome course - incredibly interesting and pertinent! It was a little disorganized this year, but that's to be expected in the first year that a course is offered. I'm not an engineer and yet this course was totally fine for me.</comment>Very useful practical knowledge regarding energy. Pretty easy as well, however regarding the research paper and final project it was quite unorganized and unlcear.</comment>A valuable opportunity to explore the global energy system from a real world angle using data and information the is nearly impossible to come by anywhere else.</comment>I enjoyed this class. It was the first time it was being taught, and any time that happens there are obviously going to be some kinks. However, I thought the material was interesting, and I really enjoyed having Professor Keith as an instructor. He's very interesting and sometimes a bit all over the place, but he is also extremely knowledgeable and passionate about the course material. The structure of the course could be improved, and likely will be as the instructors get more used to working with undergrads. The class wasn't too hard or too much of a commitment, and I learned a bunch along the way. Overall, enjoyable class, not too painful, and you walk away with a better knowledge and understanding of the energy technology and systems in the world today. I also enjoyed learning the pieces of economics that fit into the engineering/energy/political decisions associated with climate change.</comment>ES 137 was an interesting introduction to the energy industry today and the challenges it faces in improving efficiency and complying with environmental/climate standards. We covered most of the major sectors of energy (electricity generation, transportation), the environmental effects of energy production (pollution and climate change), and focused on cost-of-electricity calculations to determine what types of energy generation are economically feasible. If you're interested in the energy industry, this class is a good introduction.</comment>This is a great overview of the current energy sector and the potential for renewables. It will give you a new perspective on things and will increase your overall 'energy savvy' ten-fold. Professor Keith is very impressive and can lead interesting and enlightening class discussion. However, he sometimes appears a bit too busy or arrogant to give students enough thought (for example, when you ask him a question, he will often cut you off halfway through with an answer). He is a great guy though, and is a good professor overall. There is not too much work - the quizzes and the final were fair and interesting. I'm totally happy I took this course!</comment>Organization was not that great; we frequently found ourselves wondering what we'd be tested on.  Hopefully that will improve in future iterations.</comment>If the class is still like this, then no. Wait a couple of years, but under David Keith and the current teaching staff it is very disorganized. You may think not having psets is a blessing, but you really don't learn the material and it doesn't work out as well as you think it will.</comment>If you want to better understand the energy language and be able to deduce valuations for cost of energy or electricity, take this course!</comment>The lectures were awesome–Keith can easily hold your attention and the subject matter was both inherently interesting and presented in a compelling way, with a strong focus on real world connections, technologies, and applications.  The course was poorly organized, but that will be ironed out since this was the first time it's been taught.  The quizzes sometimes test stuff we didn't learn in lecture or quiz prep.</comment>While it presented a very interesting perspective on the current concerns around energy, this class was poorly organized and assumed a great deal of knowledge about energy sources, thermodynamics, and basic economics. (But Carolann was fantastic, though I don't think she's returning as preceptor.)</comment>The class was a bit disorganized but that it to be expected since it was the first year being offered. Professor Keith is great and also very enthusiastic about the material which makes lectures interesting. Overall course was great!</comment>It's a renewable energy fanatic's wet dream.</comment>This class was very poorly organized, but as a first year course that is to be expected. The quizzes are far preferable to psets each week, especially considering that they dropped a bunch of them. Kieth is a great professor, he is clearly extremely knowledgeable, but sometimes I don't know how biased his facts are by opinion. If you are interested in renewables, this is definitely a good course to take.</comment>One of the most practically focused classes that I have taken at Harvard.  If you are at all interested in the Energy sector then you should 100% take this class.  The workload is small, the value added is huge and the teaching is fantastic.  In the top 5 classes that I have taken in my three and a half years here.</comment>I think this class will improve as it gets a little older. Because the class was new this year, I felt as if the staff did not have the entire course planned beforehand, which made things disorganized (like the website) or vague (like some of the assignments. If you're interested in the energy system, however, I would recommend it for the most part.I found Professor Keith's lectures to be informative, but not central to understanding the material; many of the problems on the quizzes were not related to lecture. Dr. Koleci was a great help, and I hope she continues to be part of the class in the future.</comment>If you're interested at all in energy you should definitely take this class. It's a window into the brain of the professor and the guy is brilliant.</comment></course>FRSEMR 26v: Blood: From Gory to Glory</title>I highly encourage you to take this course. The content was very interesting, the professor is incredible, and the workload was very manageable.</comment>This was by far my favorite class I've taken, both because of the content and the structure of freshman seminars in general. Professor Scadden is brilliant and makes the material extremely relatable and engaging, material which I personally thought was crazy interesting. This class starts off with the cultural/anthropological/historical aspects of blood, and ends up at the biological side of blood. You read everything from Dracula to a biography of cancer. You talk about medical ethics and the implications of what we're learning--the small nature of the class made these discussions really engaging. If you're interested in science/medicine (or the implications of medicine in society), I'd highly recommend this class!</comment>The combination of the humanities with the sciences in this class was very well done!</comment>- do this class if you are passionate about biology and how the body works</comment>This class was great. Dr. Scadden is amazing, and the discussions are engaging. It is important to do the readings to get the most out of this class, and participation is crucial. Overall the experience, including some interesting lab work, was great.</comment>It is an outstanding seminar with an extraordinary professor. Professor Scadden is truly the authority on hematology and all that is covered in the class.</comment></course>SOC-STD 98nb: Inequality and Social Mobility in America</title>This was a great class, I would recommend it to anyone. I think the course title tends to attract people who think of themselves as social justice/activist types but that is not my case at all and I loved it. This course actually made me really glad to be in social studies because the level of discussion was very high, and everyone was really willing to engage with the material on an intellectual and personal level, everything that I hoped for out of the concentration. Discussions could seem a little repetitive, but there was always some new angle to get at.</comment>Anya is a great section leader and the readings each week were really interesting. It did get a little frustrating though, because we were just reading about poverty each week and it seemed like no solutions weren't coming out of our discussions. What do we have to say that public policy makers, etc haven't considered?</comment>Easily one of my favorite courses I've taken at Harvard. While the wonderful readings and reliably lively class discussions are enough to make this course stand out, Anya makes this class as incredible as it is. Her thoughtful advice and guidance make the daunting junior research paper that much more enjoyable, manageable, and rewarding. Take this course!</comment>This is a great class to get an in-depth look at income inequality and stagnating social mobility in America and think of solutions. The readings, the teaching and the class discussion all combine to provide a rich perspective on these issues. In addition, you can look in-depth at issues you truly care about through the final research paper.</comment>Definitely take the course, Anya directs the discussion very well, but ultimately we ran it the way we wanted to. Provides tons of help on your paper, very kind about it.</comment>Take it take it take it! Fantastic class -- discussions were great, readings were interesting and manageable, and the final paper goes by much easier with the amount of step-by-step guidance you get. Loved this class.</comment>This class was fantastic. Anya emphasized how excited she was to be teaching this course and her excitement came through every week as we discussed the readings. The readings were a great overview of the sociological greats on America. Anya really cares about the intellectual development of her students and that comes through every week. She'll meet with you once every couple of weeks. She's also very funny and warm and will invite the class to her house mid-semester. I absolutely recommend this course. Be prepared to think critically.</comment></course>ECON 1776: Religion and the Rise of Capitalism</title>More of a history course, but a good one if you're interested in European history during the enlightenment and also the history of economic behavior in US. Not for more "hardcore" economics majors.</comment>If you have knowledge of Christianity, and have an easy time with papers, then this class is not bad at all. Interesting information, and Julia makes section interesting and easy to conceptually grasp the material.</comment>It creates an intersting connection between past religions and how they may/did effect previous economic thinking, however there are many difficult readings.</comment>This class is pretty interesting. You only have to write 3 papers that are pretty interesting and a midterm and final.</comment>This is a unique class in the department that I recommend concentrators and non-concentrators alike to take.</comment>A really interesting way to think about economics and capitalism. But like everyone else will say, since lecture slides aren't posted, be prepared to type super fast.</comment>Very interesting class if you give it the time, readings are important but engaging in section is even more important</comment>It's an ok class, but unless you're interested in religion, I would avoid it.</comment>Lectures and material is super interesting. Papers are difficult, but overall low workload.</comment>Lectures are interesting, but Professor Friedman has a meandering style and prone to go off on tangents (planned tangents, that is -- there are slides prepared, although the content of the tangents are only marginally related to the material at hand, which is why they're still tangents). Sections go more in-depth than you need to know for the exams, and honestly, you don't need to do any of the reading other than the primary sources relevant to the essay topics you choose. Overall an interesting course, although grading is rather arbitrary, and like most essay-evaluative courses, it is easy to get a B+/A-, but impossible to get an A.</comment>This was a really cool class. We looked at the works of so many interesting religious thinkers and economists, and spoke/wrote about them from such a unique perspective. It was also pretty challenging: the section discussions were at a somewhat advanced level, and the essay questions forced you to really understand these concepts and thinkers. Professor Friedman is a great, engaging lecturer, and the TFs were both so intelligent and cool. Awesome class.</comment>The first half of the semester is a fascinating intellectual history of self-interest; the second half is a less interesting but still worthwhile account of the development of American non-elite economic thought. Only a very rudimentary understanding of microeconomics is necessary for the course, and I'd strongly recommend it to History, Religion, or Social Studies concentrators. Look over the syllabus: if the delightfully eclectic mix of texts sticks out to you, disregard the low Q scores (the course is full of more quantitative types who aren't particularly interested in the material) and take the class.</comment>This class is fine. I expected it to have more of a modern focus (all but the last two weeks is spent before the 1950s), and I'm not sure I would have taken it if I had known its exact path. The information is not terribly difficult to grasp, and although I did the majority of the readings, I probably could've gotten by with just going to lecture and looking up the excerpts online. If you're an Econ concentrator who is looking for a light class to go towards your concentration requirements, this would be a good bet for you.</comment>This class is an incredible blend of religious history, american history, economic history, and modern day economic policy.</comment>Super cool material, definitely take it because it fulfills so many requirements, as least for Ec majors.</comment>This class was AMAZING. The lectures were great and although the readings are not necessary, they were really interesting as an Economics Concentrator to understand the  fundamentals of the profession.</comment>This is a great course if you find the material interesting. If you don''t find the material interesting this class will be the bane of your existence. Lectures are boring, no lecture notes are provided, and the assignments are very difficult. However, I enjoyed the material and loved the course overall.</comment>Great course.  Very fair and engaging.</comment>This course is less work than a pset based economics course however the material is dense and the TFs are not very helpful and lecture is bland. The exam and essay questions are complicated and very long.</comment>Great Ec Elective. Some of readings are hard to understand in detail, but section and the review sessions were awesome and could summarize them to give you the main point which is what you need for exams and papers. Great Ec Elective</comment>Take this course! Professor Friedman is fantastic and an asset to have as a faculty advisor. He is a great teacher and makes the material endlessly interesting. Go to his office hours and interact with him-- he is one of the finest minds on offer in the department of economics.</comment>There is a LOT of readings. Do them and you will succeed.</comment>Very interesting materials if you like history, economics, and/or philosophy. Keeping up with the readings will help you very much in writing the paper and studying for the exam.</comment>It's an okay class if you're willing to learn about Puritans and Calvinism and more about religion than economics, really. Helpful if you've taken AP World History/AP European History before and know a little about Calvinism, although in this course you delve into the specifics a lot more. The emphasis on religion can get a little tiresome and repetitive, and it's sometimes difficult to see how it ties into economics.</comment>I'm a senior taking this class for an ec secondary and would not recommend this course to anyway. Friedman is brilliant and the overarching theme is interesting. However, I would not recommend the class. Read his article on the subject and you will get most of what you would get in the class. The papers are difficult to understand and require you just to do one reading and word vomit. The exams are a lot of tedious memorization. The class is not particularly rewarding. The class is very disorganized and the section component is poorly conceived if you don't have David as your TF. If you are thinking about taking this to fulfill multiple requirements: DON'T. Rethink it. There are great ec electives and other cool CB courses. I was told not to take it (by ec, applied math, gov, and psych concentrators) and didn't listen.</comment>This class will teach you something interesting and make you see religion from a new applied perspective.</comment>This is my favorite class I have taken at Harvard.  Ever, actually.  I found the material fascinating.  If you identify as Christian, this is a fascinating overview of church history, especially protestant history.  I was especially happy because I didn't feel there was a biased approach to the academic examination of Christianity.  I was worried about that going into the class, but happily, I found that there were no normative statements made about religion.  It was purely observational - examining how religion has influenced economics.  The sections were fantastic; I loved the format.  It was incredibly engaging - with debates and discussions.  And the lectures were intriguing.  I never felt bored.  I wish I could take this class again!  Yup, I loved it that much.  And I wish I could've spent more time really enjoying the readings because they were all fascinating.</comment>This class has been my favorite Gen Ed at Harvard! At first, it seems like the class is talking about a very obscure and odd subject. However, as the class progresses, it becomes clearer and clearer all of the themes that this class covers and how it is applicable today even. I took this for Gen Ed credit and for the Ec Writing Requirement, but I was so glad that to find that I loved the class. Professor Friedman always delivered very interesting lectures and concepts. I really wish I had had a chance to interact with him.</comment>This was a very rough class for me. Lectures contained so much content, but it was difficult to really absorb the material, especially since I was busy trying to type everything down because none of the slides would be online. Professor Friedman was very accessible outside of class with his regular office hours, and the TFs were also quite accessible. The writing assignments were particularly difficult for me, since my writing leaves much to be desired. However, compared to other courses, this class seemed to be much harsher in terms of grading, and it was even mentioned in class, that if there's anything we should have learned by the end, it is how to write. Also, the teaching styles of the TFs seemed to vary greatly. They may choose to take the big picture approach or take the close reading approach.</comment>This class seemed very interesting at the beginning, but be carefull! It gets very repetitive towards the end of the semester. In any case, you might still want to take it because it fulfills both CB and econ writing requirement at the same time.</comment>Professor Friedman is a great lecturer, and this class makes you think very deeply about religion and the influence of important thinkers on economics.</comment>Stay on top of readings.</comment>This course surprised me a great deal and in a good way. It is not your conventional Economics Class. You learn a lot not only but the history of economics as a discipline, but also the main figures of religious thought that have shaped British and American policy and culture. Workload is reasonable and the lectures are very interesting. I would personally say that I enjoyed the first half of the class a little bit more, as the second half became a little bit repetitive. But on the overall, a solid class with a lot of thoughtful and entertaining readings.</comment>Super interesting class. I actually wanted to go to lecture.</comment>it is hard</comment>This course feels more like a Social Studies course than an Economics one. There's nothing wrong with that, and you learn some really interesting stuff about the origins of economic thinking. However, if you don't have experience reading social/political theory, this course may be more difficult than anticipated, as it relies heavily on primary texts and drawing connections between primary authors.</comment>If you need c&b and/or the econ writing req and/or studies of the past, decently painless way to fulfill</comment>Take if ec concentrator. Optional paper for writing requirement.</comment>It's a lot of knowledge offered in lecture form, but it's a worthwhile class to take once you realize how much religious influence there actually was on the economic discipline as a whole. It also explains the differences in political parties in terms of economic policies in the 21st century.</comment>I think this class is a great western economic history through the lens of religion.  I learned a lot through this class, although it is a bit reading intensive for an ec class.</comment>I feel like I actually did learn a lot of really interesting information in this class, but it feels kind of disjointed. Hopefully they will restructure the material. If so, I'd recommend it.</comment>This class is more a religion class than an economics one. I gets way too bogged down in religious nuances and so many times in the term I forgot that I was taking this for ec credit. That can get really old really quickly. Lecture slides aren't posted online which wouldn't be a problem except for the way lectures are presented. There is a ton of random information that is totally irrelevant (like what specific Church authors preached at) and delivered really slowly but the actual material is sped through. 

In hindsight I would not have taken this class.</comment>I think its a great class but the assessment process could be streamlined.  Essays seemed to be graded haphazardly</comment>Take during semester when you have extra time, because the reading is heavy every week and you won't get the most out of the course if you don't read everything.</comment>This is a pretty interesting course, with a lot of information that helps to explain religious influences on economics. If you're looking for a course that covers a lot of information on the interaction between economics and religion today, this course only talks about it for one lecture. Start the last paper much earlier than the others if you decide to write it.</comment>It's a lot harder than it looks. There's a lot of material, and you need to know all the readers and thinkers cold.</comment>Too too much work, but definitely good material. It might be slightly boring to sit through the lectures in which the pictures of architecture of France are picked apart with seemingly no relevance to the readings, but it's great if you have a good TF who brings it all together!</comment>It's one of the best intermediate Ec courses at Harvard.</comment></course>ENG-SCI 96: Engineering Problem Solving and Design Project</title>It is all about how your team works together so try to make it work well from the start</comment>How good this class is will entirely depend on the project and professor. Although in any case you can expect to be given a lot of last minute assignments, presumably to try and simulate a real-world consulting experience.</comment>It's a really enjoyable class if you put your time and effort into it. The project is different each semester and for different sections, but generally it's a cool experience because you get to work on a giant team with all of your classmates on an interesting project that really challenges you to think in different ways than you are used to. There are no formal instructions nor will the professor tell you how to solve problems. You will get the chance to work on a real-world problem the way that people do it in industry. I would recommend it even if you are not an engineering SB concentrator because it's challenging in a fun way and you really bond with your classmates.</comment>96 is a beast of a class, but if the topic is good, it can be very rewarding. Working on the SEAS move to Allston was particularly exciting for us to dive into. Be prepared to spend a tremendous amount of time particularly at the end during the presentation and report writing phase.</comment>The final few weeks are extremely(!) busy, but ultimately it was a great course and you'll learn a lot about yourself and how to work on a large, undefined project.</comment>I had an amazing experience in this class--the best group work experience I've ever had!</comment>Your team for this class will pretty much determine your overall experience with the course -- you will spend a ton of time with them, which can be really fun to make new friends, but definitely requires a lot of teamwork and compromising for the final product to be a success</comment>ES96 will by far be one of the best courses you take at Harvard. Consider taking this even if it's not required for you! You get to spend a semester taking ownership of a real-world project and creating something you are proud of. Some of the people you work with are also incredible, and may even become some of your best friends! It is a lot of work, so don't take the class lightly. However, it is some of the most enjoyable and satisfying work you will find yourself doing at Harvard.</comment>Find out which problems are being tackled by the ES96 sections your junior year, and try to pick one you find interesting. The class is great if you are invested in the project.</comment>I assume that one's experience in this course depends wildly on the project and the professor.  Prof. Howe often sprung assignments on us (and lengthy or time-consuming ones at that), so I always had to have time set aside for ES 96 surprises.  His (stated) philosophy on the class was to dunk students into various activities, such as project planning or presenting, and then correct our mistakes after the fact, which I found more frustrating than productive, and wasted us a lot of time.  That being said, he clearly cares a lot about the class going well and tried to make himself available to students throughout the semester.</comment>Be prepared to really engage with this course. You are bound to learn a lot of really essential skills about presenting and project management, but if you are excited about it you can also have a really positive experience getting to know your classmates.</comment>Fun course but that will depend on topic (which changes each semester/section), prof, and group of students. All teamwork so having a good team makes or breaks the experience.</comment></course>RUSS 113: Advanced Russian: Readings in Russian Literature</title>You'd be lucky to be in any class with Natalia Iosifovna, and this is a particularly great one for the literarily inclined!</comment></course>SOCIOL 221: Immigration, Identity and Assimilation: Seminar</title>Fantastic class! Had students from different schools, so a lot of different viewpoints were brought to the table. Professor Waters is great!</comment>This is a great course! Prof. Waters creates an environment of in-depth engagement with the course materials, and creates a high-participatory environment for students</comment>This course will open your eyes to an incredibly important, emergent subfield; the reading list is fantastic, the instructor is at the top of the field.</comment>To me, it really only makes sense to take if you are very very interested in immigrant assimilation. I did not think it was particularly helpful for thinking about other aspects of immigration research.</comment></course>GHHP 60: Negotiation and Conflict Management: From the Interpersonal to the International</title>The teaching staff of this course was absolutely incredible. They were so passionate and helpful, which made the course very well organized and more interesting. The general topic of the course is highly interesting, but there's a lot of repetition of very basic course concepts that I think took useful time away from talking about more international negotiations/conflicts. However, I would definitely recommend this course for those interested in global health!</comment>Very involved and nice professor and teaching fellows. However, once you get about midway through the course, it feels like you're just practicing what you've already learned without learning new things.</comment>It's fantastic!</comment>This class may possibly be my favorite at Harvard to date! The teaching team is amazing and the classes are so much fun. Three hours might seem long, but it flies by. This is also one of those classes in which you learn skills and lessons that are incredibly applicable to the real world, regardless of what career path you may choose to pursue. I would recommend this class as one that every student should try to take before they graduate - I loved it!</comment>Highly recommend this class. You will learn a lot about negotiation, and have fun doing it.</comment>The class is incredibly fun and the professor is engaging, but the material feels fabricated and not very realistic.</comment>TAKE THIS COURSE!</comment>This is THE class to take. I don't think anyone should graduate from Harvard before taking this class. I can confidently say it is the best course available, and Professor Shapiro is both one of the best people and professors I have met. He cares for his students so much and makes so many initiatives to get to know every single one--one very rarely sees this characteristic in a professor, especially one with Prof Shapiro's prominence. The class will change your entire outlook on life!</comment>Fantastic class. The stuff this course teaches you will stay with you and help you in difficult situations (especially in business and politics) for the rest of your life. This is one of those few classes at Harvard that truly make the $68k sticker price of Harvard worth it. Prof. Shapiro is awesome and the classes are really fun. Workload isn't too bad either. TAKE IT!</comment>The professor and course simulations make the class. The tools help in everyday life more so than you would think, and being open to learning how you approach conflict situations is certainly helpful. The class is great for a fresh perspective!</comment>AMAZING CLASS! Actually life changing.  Probably the best class at Harvard. Professor Shapiro is absolutely phenomenal and excited about everything - half the class is figuring out conflict resolution in your own life and the other half is about how to make the world a better place.  EVERYONE SHOULD TAKE THIS CLASS! TO LIVE IN THE REAL WORLD THIS CLASS IS IMPERATIVE!!!</comment>This is my favourite class from Harvard so far.</comment>ATTENDANCE POLICY is extremely strict. Be very wary, especially if you have job or grad school interviews during the semester you're taking the class, because the course administrators, although they understand these things are important/inflexible/unavoidable/must be prioritized, will not exempt you from the grade deductions. Aside from that, course teaches invaluable skills. I don't regret taking it, despite the hit my grade took from having to miss class twice. Course felt repetitive at some times, but I felt the repetition was useful for drilling in these ideas that seem obvious but that we NEVER really put into use in our daily lives.</comment>This course was amazing!  Although it was not in any way related to global health (as it is listed), the skills learned over the course of the semester will be immensely helpful later in life.</comment>Definitely a must-take class if you can get in. Obviously, like with any lotteried course, it is difficult to get in unless you know the instructor in some capacity or have contacted him previously (like hundreds of other people do). My suggestion is to play up the diverse perspective you will bring to the class as well as to show up early to the first class and participate, or at least search out Professor Shapiro separately before the semester you want to take this class in order to get on his radar. It is worth the effort invested to get into the class. The content is fairly straightforward but it is the out-of-class discussions with the highly invested teaching team that really allows this class to flourish.</comment>This is a fantastic class! Prof. Shapiro is incredibly knowledgeable, engaging and passionate about the subject matter. Plus he and the teaching staff really care about the students. You'll learn a lot about the art of negotiation, and I was able to apply to many aspects of my personal and academic life, and see an immediate impact. The more you put into this class, the more you get out of it!</comment>This class is amazing. Although you will have days where you become disillusioned with the course, the teaching team is incredible and you will learn from them.</comment>This class is amazing because of the fantastic teaching team and the fascinating subject. I really believe that this is one of those college classes that completely changed the way I look at the world. The three hour class each Monday never seemed too long because we would have about one hour of lecture and then about another hour for simulations when we had to try to negotiate and try to apply the concepts we learned. This structure really brought to life the topics we covered in class. Professor Shapiro and the TF are also just wonderful. Shapiro is an amazing lecturer! All of them really foster a community inside of the classroom, enabling the students not only to negotiate and apply the concepts we learned, but also making space for friendships to foster. I learned so much about how to change my approach to relationships across any spectrum of my life while also making new friends and mentors.</comment>Great course, very easy and you learn useful material for the real world. It is a gem!</comment>a</comment>Best course I have taken at Harvard. Learnt a lot and put in very little work. Very applicable to real life. Shapiro is a real bro.</comment></course>HAA 242: Issues of Interpretation in Medieval Art : Seminar</title>excellent course for graduate level students, introducing not only to medieval art history but to art historical methodologies.</comment></course>ECON 2410: Advanced Topics in Macroeconomics</title>A great survey of important papers in macro. Gabe is great at working through the papers in class. However, this is not going to be a technical/methods-based field course though.</comment>The course covered many topics at the frontier of current research in macroeconomics, and I would recommend it enthusiastically to anyone interested in the field.</comment>It covers a wide range of empirical macro topics, with many different subjects and methodologies, so it is useful to be exposed to it.</comment></course>MBB 980a: Conscious States: Waking, Sleeping, and Dreaming</title>This course is a fantastic chance to put some reading and thinking into your semester. The material is dense and it won't pay off if you don't put in the work. Make sure you are enthusiastic about the material and willing to attempt (and fail!) to answer one of the hardest questions that faces science(and philosophy!)</comment>This was probably one of the best, if not the best courses I have taken at Harvard. When you see a brochure for Harvard, this is the type of class you would see on it and be enticed by: it is truly interdisciplinary, fitting it's MBB label (sure, it was founded in science but I felt we also talked about philosophy, technology, and other disciplines), only five people, and one of the most stimulating courses ever. Be prepared to think harder than you've thought in other classes, write on these reflections, and speak on them as well. Professor Stickgold is one of the smartest yet most approachable professors I've had at Harvard. He is so knowledgable in his field (he's an expert in sleep and dream research, yet so humble) and also on the topic of consciousness. Definitely take this course. It will have a decent amount of work and some moments of confusion, but it will make you a better scientist and thinker in the future. The readings were also fantastic and substantive. I wish I could take this course again, as it was one of the few classes at Harvard I have truly looked forward to attending each week.</comment>Professor Stickgold is so knowledgeable about this field. He provides a great range of sources to better understand sleep and consciousness, and he also fosters great discussion. I am glad I chose to take this course.</comment></course>JAPAN 120a: Intermediate Japanese I</title>It's difficult, but you learn an incredible amount, and Shingu sensei is AMAZING!</comment>Definitely take this course if you've already taken Ba and Bb. It is definitely much more difficult than Ba or Bb, but it's completely worth it and you'll learn so much more in 120 than you already did in B-levels.</comment>This class is so much fun! But you learn a lot too!</comment>This class helps you get a greater understanding of more complex grammar points. I feel that my speaking and writing capabilities definitely increased over the course of the semester. Be sure to review all Kanji learned!.</comment>Shingu sensei is great. She really cares about her students and puts a lot of effort into making sure lectures and assignments are on point.</comment>Demanding but rewarding. Shingu-sensei and Nishimura-sensei put their hearts into the course, and it shows in the course material and assignment feedback. Be prepared to work hard and not fall behind, but this class will make your Japanese improve by a ridiculous amount!</comment>Extremely well taught. I have also taken Chinese here at Harvard, but hands down Japanese is taught better. It focuses on few grammar points and drill them into your head.</comment>A bigger time commitment than Jpn Bb/Ba but do continue taking Japanese as you will improve so much.</comment>This class is great, but pretty challenging. Meeting 5 days a week, you really don't get a break from Japanese till the semester is over. However, your Japanese will GREATLY improve by the end.</comment>Second year may appear as a leap from first year in terms of difficulty. More efforts are expected.</comment>There is a high workload and fast pace, but you will learn a lot and improve your Japanese immensely.</comment>I loved this course. A lot. If you like the language, and care about the culture, and are willing to put the work in, it's fantastic. The teachers are supportive and the occasional confusion definitely bonds the students together.</comment>This is simply an amazing course! Shingu-sensei and Nishimura-sensei are absolutely dedicated to teaching and are always ready to help. Even if you need help on something not directly related to a lesson, they're always available by email or at their office hours. I know I spent many of mine having discussions with them on various topics for the practice. It's a good amount of work, but totally worth it in the end. My Japanese has improved tremendously thanks to both of them!</comment></course>RELIGION 40: Incarnation and Desire: An Introduction to Christianity</title>This class is one of the best I've taken at Harvard. Prof. Lamberth is the best teacher I have ever had here, better than most big name professors. She teaches with enthusiasm, and I always come away knowing more than I expected to learn. The course is accessible to everyone, and the readings are really manageable.  This is a great introduction to Christianity, even for religion concentrators or very devout Christians. I learned so much about the history of Christianity, even having grown up in a Christian home.  The course material was varied and interesting. A great option for C&B!</comment>This is a really good course if you're looking to fulfill your Culture and Belief requirement and/or if you are interested in learning more about Christianity on a historical and theoretical level. Professor Lamberth is very enthusiastic about the material and always seems excited facilitate discussion and hear student perspectives.</comment>You need to be committed to reading a lot of early writing!</comment>This is an excellent overview of Christian history, the readings are amazing and well-selected and manageable, Professor Lamberth is an amazing professor not to mention human being.</comment>This course is a wonderful introduction to the Study of Religion at Harvard. Although the focus is really the history of Christian thought, there are detours into other traditions and areas of study. There is something for everybody, and it helped me discover and narrow down some specific areas of interests of my own. The lectures and sections were engaging and really helped me make sense of the texts. This is invaluable, since some of the texts, especially the later ones, contain dense philosophical language that is somewhat daunting for those unfamiliar with the discipline. Whether you need to fulfill a Culture and Belief Gen Ed, are seriously interested in the Study of Religion, or just curious, I would thoroughly recommend checking out this course.</comment>If you are genuinely interested in Christianity, this class is great for learning the history of the faith. Interest in the subject material will motivate you to get through some of the more difficult readings. If you take interest in the class and do the readings, you will learn a tremendous amount.</comment>this course is a lot of reading if you choose to do it all, would not advise taking it with another course that requires a lot of reading</comment>Prof. Lamberth is great. she is very enthusiastic and you can tell she really cares about students and teaching. the material is really interesting too. not too much work. at times though she will fall behind schedule because of the scope of material we cover.</comment>This is a real gem of a GenEd - an interesting, useful topic taught in a depth most undergraduates won't have seen before. It also is taught very well - lectures are very engaging and assignments are actually fun and useful.</comment>There is a lot of reading for this class that you might be tempted to skip, but you can get so much out of this class, no matter your background, if you really apply yourself.</comment>As a non-Christian, this course was fascinating and a great introduction to an important part of Western cultural history that I have not been very exposed to.  That said, many people in the class are highly observant believers and walking the line between engaging in academic criticism and feeling like an outsider can be a challenge.  Doable, but a challenge.</comment>This course is fascinating, definitely worth taking. Only drawback is that there's more reading than you originally think.</comment>Very useful introduction to the tradition for interested students who know a little but want to learn more and put what they know in context</comment>Great class. Take it and do the readings.</comment>This class is awesome primarily because of the teaching staff. Professor Lamberth is an engaging lecturer and has a tremendous amount of care for her students. John is also an amazing TF and made section a ton of fun. I think this class also attracts a lot of interesting people from a very diverse background.</comment>This is a great class. I thoroughly without hesitation or reservation recommend it.  I was Christian myself going into it, but I learned a ton I didn't know and it has transformed my faith.  Even if you are not religious you will be fine because I had several friends in the class who were not and they were often the ones who contributed most to discussion because of their unique perspective and curiosity on things.  Take it!</comment>An interesting class for both people with little to no background in Christianity and for those who do have such a background. The readings can get a little long and dense, but it's not absolutely necessary to do them all or even most of them to do well in the class, although it is much more rewarding if you do all the readings.</comment>There are a lot of readings, but do not be intimidated. Just make sure you get the main points if you don't have time. If you have time, read them; they're great. Professor Lamberth is an incredible lecturer, and sections were wonderful. This class is very reasonable, not stressful, relevant to life, and a whole lot of fun. Don't hesitate!!</comment>Whether you are religious or not, this course provides a phenomenal introduction to the history of religion that anyone remotely interested in philosophy, theology, or history would enjoy. The teaching staff is excellent and is more than willing to assist with essays at any stage in the writing process. This class has relatively little work with only two essays and a final exam, which shouldn't scare you because Professor Lamberth's goal really is to help you learn and show what you know. The final is very manageable and reasonable, especially if you have kept up with the readings, but as long as you review the passages that are discussed in class and in section, the final exam should not be an issue. The strategy I would recommend if the readings become too much for you is to skim them the night they are assigned and then go back and review the important passages brought to attention in class. This is an extremely satisfying course that provides an excellent introduction to Christianity and theology, but even if you aren't planning on taking another religion class past your Culture and Belief Gen Ed requirement, this would be the one I recommend.</comment></course>MED-SCI 300qc: Conduct of Science</title>Take it because you have to. Go to the sessions and sections because it's better than writing a bunch of papers. Mostly importantly, choose a good section leader (Debbie Marks was great!) because then section will be fun and interesting!</comment>Good forum to talk about various important and sensitive ethical issues.</comment>It's mandatory so you do not have a choice</comment>It is an opportunity to discuss questions and concerns related to working in a lab. It helps one realize that many people share similar concerns.</comment>It doesn't take a lot of time and understanding proper conduct of science is important for a scientist!</comment>you will have a lot of interesting discussions, but you don't get a lot of direction for what you actually should do if you're in an ethically ambiguous situation or how to avoid such situations. The overarching principles are conveyed, but the actually grey areas where people get into trouble don't really have any guidelines.</comment>This stuff happens to everyone. Pay attention.</comment>It's very easy and if you have a good section, the discussions are interesting. The lectures are boring, but attendance is mandatory so there's not much you can do about that.</comment>Too bad you have to take this - it's required.</comment>I would tell them to pick a section based off of an interesting faculty member that they would like to get to know.</comment>You have to take it.</comment>Nothing.</comment>It's required, and depending on your section leader, it may or may not be useful.</comment>Biomedical ethics is interesting and important, don't let this course fool you!</comment>It's kind of silly, but it's required! You might get something out of it if you get a good discussion leader, though.</comment>Get a section near where you work.</comment>It's not that bad and the discussions can get lively.</comment>Section can be useful by talking about cases that may be relevant to lab life and what you may encounter.</comment>You are required to take this course, but it isn't too bad. If Prof. Allen comes to speak again, I'd recommend even students who aren't in the course to sit in on her talk. She's awesome.</comment>Don't worry about it and enjoy it</comment></course>LING 250: Old Church Slavonic</title>It's very hard and time-consuming, but Michael Flier is a very engaging teacher.</comment></course>IMUNOL 201: Principles of Immunology</title>This class will give you guidance to establish a good base in immunology if you methodically follow their outline and apply steady effort on your own to keep all the pieces together. Yes, it's a lot of memorization, but there is plenty of direct logic and good storytelling here too.</comment>the material is interesting if you like immunology, but if you're just looking for an overview and main concepts, this class isn't for you. It can be tedious at times and many of the lectures aren't that interesting</comment></course>RELIGION 20: Ethnographies of Religion, Texts and Contexts</title>This class requires a lot of initiative, but it is fascinating to see religion played out in real life and study it academically.</comment>the class was so interesting. I looked forward to doing the reading for this class every single week, and loved the final project. it was a ton of work but I also felt like I got so much out of it and am now excited and ready to begin thinking about my thesis. Our class discussions on the material were so engaging and I walked away every week with a new understanding of the novel we had discussed and even more questions about how to conduct my own ethnography.</comment>Marla is one of the best teachers I have had at Harvard. She does incredibly work and is inspiring to her students.</comment>This class is an excellent introduction to ethnography. Marla is an incredibly insightful professor and simply a wonderful person. I SO enjoyed the opportunity to conduct personal research, though it admittedly stretched me outside of my comfort zone. This will absolutely be one of the most memorable classes I've taken at Harvard, because of the ethnographic research project.</comment></course>ECON 10a: Principles of Economics</title>Make sure you keep up with the readings, especially if you do not have a good TF.</comment>Do problem sets early.</comment>we need more mankiw lectures</comment>This class is manageable. The material may not be the most interesting, but it's necessary to learn if you are going to concentrate in econ. I was actually surprised by the volume of information I learned about micro by the end of the semester. The information really starts to click a few weeks into the course. The psets can be tricky but you can get them done fairly easily if you go to office hours. You will do well on exams (they are heavily curved) if you take the time to study and understand all of the concepts. Take this class if you are really interested in econ or are going to concentrate in econ; however, don't take this as an easy gen ed as the course does require a good deal of work.</comment>Choose a good section leader.</comment>This course can be helpful to develop economic literacy which can ultimately shift the way you look at the world. However, you should take this course seriously and complete the readings. You get as much out of Ec10 as you put in.</comment>This is a good foundational course in economics.</comment>Do not shy away from Ec10 just because you have heard horror stories about it, but also do not take it unless you have a genuine interest in the material, otherwise you will be pretty miserable for a semester.</comment>Ec 10 is the only introductory economics class offered at Harvard, so take it if you want to use economics in the future. However, take everything that you learn in the class with a grain of salt. Understand that the course offers a biased sample of microeconomic thinking, and claims objectivity for extremely subjective statements.

Students who take Professor Mankiw on his word will leave the class believing it to be simple economic fact that raising the minimum wage increases unemployment or that the Laffer Curve has real-world implications when there is not anything close to consensus on these ideas within the economic community. The course teaches a philosophy that values profit over people and uses a logic of generalized assumptions backed up by little concrete data.</comment>Interesting material. There's definitely a conservative spin on some of the material, but take it with a grain of salt and remember that it's just the most basic principles and ignores many of the real-world issues. Mathematical sophistication is basically non-existent, and if you've taken calculus before you'll likely be hitting yourself over the head by how simple the math is. Psets are by far the most difficult part of the class. The only thing you should watch out for is that exams will have questions about the most random facts from lecture so be prepared for that.</comment>Go to office hours if you're confused.</comment>Try not to get too caught up in the terms and definitions in the textbook; a better way to approach the course material is to think about the "how" and "why" of the big concepts, as well as how each of the concepts relates to each other.</comment>This class is very important to be a knowledgable citizen, but it should absolutely be two gen eds for both semesters.</comment>It was a great class, especially if one takes advantage of opportunities such as office hours to make the most out of the course.</comment>Whether you like Ec or not and your success in the course all depends on your TF. Simple enough.</comment>Whether you will like Econ 10a depends on two things:
1. Whether you have a good TF (which is pure luck -- although some switching is allowed)
2. Whether you naturally like economics 
The course isn't set up in a way that it makes economics interesting for people who wouldn't normally find it so -- only take this class if you actually like economics.</comment>Go to David Johnson's' office hours. It will change your life. He is beyond amazing.</comment>didn't love it</comment>I thought this was a great course. It really increased my understanding of economics. Just to give a little background, I'm a sophomore with absolutely no econ experience and I found the course to be both easy and really manageable. The problem sets were not time intensive or particularly difficult. I didn't have much time to study for the exams, but really all you have to do is spend some time on the practice exam materials. Naturally, due to the nature of the course, it all depends on your section leader.</comment>This class is boring and slow. If you took AP Economics in high school, SKIP THIS CLASS. Try at any cost to get into 1010a. Furthermore, otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it. They have a captive audience in that you have to take this course to take other ec courses which is a shame because this class is so impersonal, scripted, and uninteresting.</comment>This class is taught very effectively and efficiently, and if the resources that this course provides are taken full advantage of, then a student will have a great understanding of microeconomics when the course terminates.</comment>Take this class or you're not an informed citizen.</comment>If you know the math, you'll be extremely bored, but still get the intuition.</comment>Ec10 was a lot of fun for me. Your experience will depend a lot on your TF and if you keep up with the readings. You will struggle if you try to just go to section because they don't cover everything in the textbook.</comment>It's EC10a, you can't not take it because it's requirement. So it's as enjoyable as a good required course, but certainly not an elective. Mankiw is the worst - pray for a good TF.</comment>Ec10 is really worth taking. If you work hard and have a good section leader, you will be able to do well. The exams are very reasonable and not worth stressing about. You will be well prepared if you pay attention in section. There's always some material in the lectures that gets tested on the exams, so they're absolutely worth going to, not to mention that some of the lectures are by very prominent economists. Ec10a is a great way to knock out a gen ed requirement and see if economics is of interest to you.</comment>I believe that all students should take this course to have an understanding of economics</comment>It's a great class that teaches you a lot.</comment>There is a reason that this course is the most widely attended course at Harvard. The material does the job, though you could likely learn it through the text book rather than in class. Either way, I recommend taking the course and attending the lectures to gain from the material.</comment>I took this course as an elective, and I am glad I took it because I think it helped me understand a basic level of how markets work. The workload isn't too bad, and there's help available. I've also heard that Ec 10b is something better suited for real-world applications, which is something to keep in mind.</comment>I feel like how much you'll take out of this course is largely dependent on the quality of your TF.  I had a great TF, so I enjoyed the class, but I know others who feel differently.</comment>Great intro to economics class--came in without ever taking any classes in econ, and feel that I have gained a lot from Ec10. The experience really depends on your section leader, though</comment>Be careful before you enroll in this course. Everyone is taking it, but that does NOT mean you should. If you have a bad TF (like I did) then you will struggle with the exams. This may not be because you don't understand the material, but rather is a result of the fact that the exams are designed to be tricky. Without helpful hints from a TF you will likely struggle.</comment>I actually wish this class becomes a General Education requirement. It develops a more critical lens in policy and it really is effective for all disciplines.</comment>Take this class if it is a requirement for a concentration or want to take more advanced economics, but it is such a basic look at economics that if you are just looking to understand economics it provides such an idealized look at the system that is not entirely applicable to the real world.</comment>Ec 10 is a solid class that equips you with the basic tools of economics while at the same time teaching you concepts that are relatable to real life. Also, David Johnson is an amazing teacher and it is so sad that he will be leaving. When I was preparing to take Ec. 10, I asked people who had taken it before for advice and they kept on hammering "Go to David Johnson's office hours". I didn't understand what that meant until I actually went to Office Hours. All the concepts that I struggled to understand in section became so much more clearer.</comment>Your mileage with this class depends heavily on your section.

Lots of times, the concepts covered in section don't necessarily convert well to understanding and completing the psets.</comment>Everyone should know a little bit about how scarce resources are allocated.</comment>Honestly the experience really varies with the TF you get. I'd recommend talking to your friends and trying to get a TF they recommend because some of them are just straight awful from what I've heard.</comment>This is a challenging class, especially if you haven't taken micro before, which many of the people taking the class have.  But, you learn a ton and will be a better informed citizen and voter.</comment>Good material for everybody to have an understanding of.</comment>Be ready to work a lot on problem sets and to integrate concepts that typically aren't related to one another in high school economics.</comment>As long as you stay on top of your time management and understanding of what is being taught, this class is an incredibly interesting and rewarding class to take.</comment>Gives a great overview of microeconomics</comment>This course has a lot of potential. The material is interesting, and I've definitely left with a different perspective on key economic issues such as the minimum wage and the carbon tax. However, I found section to be basically be a boring summation of the textbook, problem sets were tedious, and the exams asked very specific unfair questions from lectures. The material is great, but it's just delivered poorly. Mankiw, the "professor" is inacessible and holds office hours randomly and infrequently. Nonetheless, I'm glad to have taken this class, but with a little reform, it could have been much better</comment>If you've already taken AP and done well, this class should be easy, but still interesting.</comment>At times it may seem frustrating and you may be cursing Mankiw for lecturing so little, but at the end of the day it teaches you what you need to know, and you need to know the material and understand basic economics to understand our world and be an informed citizen.</comment>It is a really good class, only reservation is that your section leaders can really impact how much you learn. Go to Johnson's office hours and make sure to take the unit tests.</comment>This class provides theoretical foundations to analyze incentives and choices, and their effects on consumers and producers alike.</comment>Be prepared, lots of reading</comment>lot of work but worth it</comment>it is very annoying and difficult but it is worth it if you have a passion for economics</comment>Solid introductory economics class that's light on lectures, heavy on sections.</comment>Make sure to get a good TF, or find a better one to ask about psets; it's a huge class so stick up for yourself!!!</comment>Ec 10a is a challenging course, but it is manageable if your keep up with the textbook readings. Additionally, if you have a background in microeconomics (high school AP level), you should be very confident in your ability to succeed in this course.</comment>Try to stay on top of your work, if you get behind you will have trouble</comment>Having a good TF will influence greatly how interested you will be in the subject. With head TF David Johnson leaving next year, one might be more wary as to how the course will be.</comment>Even if not required, this class is a great way to get a basic education in economics that will help you be a more informed citizen.</comment>This is one of the largest courses at Harvard that all students seem to take at one point or another, so I do think it's important to take this course for the solid foundation of microeconomic theory that it will give you. Ultimately, it's a manageable course if you study hard and manage your time well, and you will get a lot out of it if you do all the readings and psets!</comment>Ec10a is a great class and a great intro to the field of economics. The key to having a good experience with this class is getting a good TF, and I was lucky enough to get Stephanie. If you keep up with the material and the readings, it is not a difficult class, but it is very easy to get behind.</comment>It's not great being taught almost exclusively by TF's. If you're interested in economics though, you kind of have to take it.</comment>Even if you're not planning to do anything related to econ, this is a valuable course to take because of how applicable it is to daily life. The material is quite interesting, and it pushes you to look at the world through a different lens, which I personally found exciting. The problem sets can sometimes be quite a bit of work, but it helps to work with people.</comment>don't take it unless you need to</comment>The average grade in this class is a B+; that does not make this class an easy one by any means.</comment>It's not particularly fun, but it is foundational. If you don't get a good TF at first, switch at all costs. David Johnson likes to draw test questions from the optional readings.</comment>TF quality varies wildly.</comment>A standard requirement for Ec concentrators but also interesting as an introduction to how markets work for general knowledge.</comment>Ec10 is a great class overall. It definitely has the potential to help you become a more informed citizen, and every Harvard student should understand basic economics. However, the class experience depends almost solely on your TF and your experience in section. Lecture is definitely a chore, and not much teaching/learning happens during lecture. Section can be an amazing, eye-opening experience, and the psets/exams are all designed for in-depth learning. Even if you got a mediocre TF, David Johnson's office hours and review sessions, which were must-attend, were open to all. Unfortunately, with David Johnson leaving at the end of the 2014-2015 school year, who knows what Ec10 will look like in the future.</comment>That although it may not be the most interesting class, it is necessary if you want to pursue a concentration in economics.</comment>Greg Mankiw is the chillest dude of all time. This class will open your mind.</comment>Take the unit tests, use the helpful hints posted on the course site, and read the textbook (including the supplemental boxes/asides). Start your psets early so you have time to go to office hours. Know that you aren't restricted to your TF's office hours--you can go to office hours held by other TFs, David Johnson (or the next course head), etc. Understand that Mankiw is conservative and that the course is introductory. You have to wade through the conceptual, foundational material before getting to the interesting real-world or interdisciplinary applications of economics. Some of the lectures do give you a glimpse of what lies ahead.</comment>This course is foolishly taught via sections from often poor TFs rather via than lecture from a good teacher. This is so that Harvard can keep its average class size numbers down, but has a terrible effect on the course by making it inconsistent and inequitable. A horribly run course with great unrealized potential to better inform the views of all those who take it. With the departure of David Johnson I'm afraid it'll only get worse - until they finally realize its worth the statistical hit to just teach via lecture and have everybody learn from a good instructor.</comment>Make sure your ready for the time commitment and know what you are getting into. I really liked the class though and that I can I understand concepts I hear on the news now.</comment>This course is a very good entry into economics to see if you like the subject and wish to pursue it</comment>I would say that if you're a first-year student looking to take this course because you might be interested in economics, avoid it until sophomore year.  You can definitely still be an economics concentrator without taking it during the fall of your first year.  It is definitely one of the worst courses that I have taken during my time at Harvard, and the only reason I took it was because it was required for my concentration.  Your experience is 100% dependent on your TF, and they vary in quality... a lot.  That said... if you have the time to dedicate to this course including going to office hours and doing all of the unit tests, it isn't too difficult, and you can do well... it just requires a lot of personal effort because the teaching isn't always the best.</comment>You should take it for a basic understanding of the world.</comment>This is a challenging course, perhaps less so if you have taken Economics in high school. Even if you did, you might learn some new things. Take the optional unit exams, even though they sometimes test on a few topics and concepts that aren't covered in the course textbook, or even in section. The real exams are harder than necessary.</comment>Go to office hours (Especially David Johnson's) and you will understand the course material a lot better.</comment>Not too painful, probably worth taking for the experience.</comment>Do the readings!</comment>Take this class but be ready to put more time and effort than is asked of you into it if you want to be successful.</comment>Ec 10 is an essential class. It is not particularly engaging, it is not particularly exciting, and it will probably not succeed in making you love economics. That said, the basic concepts of Microeconomics are important in every field. This class, if nothing else, does a good job of explaining these basic concepts. It is not a class I would take for fun, but it's also not one I would have skipped. The problem sets are doable, the tests are pretty doable as well, and sections aren't terrible (mind you, I had a good section leader) My suggestion is, grit your teeth, accept that you'll want to take it eventually, and get it out of the way freshman year.</comment>If you want to do well in the exams, it would require most of your own initiative by studying the helpful hints and going to office hours.</comment>it's incredibly difficult, like you have to put in a ton of extra time, harder than it seems</comment>If you don't understand something, ABSOLUTELY GET HELP IMMEDIATELY. Every concept builds on the previous concept, and missing any key point will result in you being continually lost as more concepts get piled on which don't make sense. Go to all the office hours you can, you really need it. Bring your psets there, because these psets take forever.</comment>This is a great course to learn the basics of economics.</comment>If you don't love economics it is a challenging course although the applications of theories are interesting</comment>Hard, but interesting class.</comment>Work hard and it will be rewarding.</comment>If you've never taken Econ before, this is a great introductory class. If you took AP Econ, micro and/or macro in high school and are debating whether or not to take this course or to take a higher level of econ, take this course. While I didn't really learn much in section, the minimal amount of work and great lectures (however few there are) made this course worth it.</comment>I would definitely recommend that you take this course. It's essential that you learn these theories not for only the class but also for your practical life.</comment>Ec10 can be a great and extremely informative class, if you are willing to put in the time commitment. I opted to taking the Problem Sets slow because that's just how I learned the material. So someone like me would have to put aside quite some time for this course.</comment>Very interesting, but somewhat difficult because of the teaching style. Make sure you go to office hours.</comment>It's a good course, but your success really has a great deal to do with your proctor.  By success I mean comprehension of the material.</comment>Mankiw never shows up so don't be alarmed.  Pay attention in section.</comment>This course should not be called Greg Mankiw's course-- the head TF creates and runs the entire course, with Makiw featured a handful of times throughout the semester if you're lucky. His lack of effort/participation in the course is frustrating. It is taught entirely in section.</comment>I took this class as someone who does not intend to concentrate in economics, but wanted to learn the basics in order to help future studies of international relations/to be a good global citizen. While it is a good introductory course in that it is careful not to demand more of students than they would be able to do as beginners in the field, it is a terrible introductory course for someone like me--it doesn't teach a lot of "real economics" but rather focuses either on a very shallow overview that is basically just common sense, or on silly details that won't be important or memorable in the long run. The class is also terribly and frustratingly organized, and is overall a bad experience. Don't take this unless you have to for concentration requirements.</comment>PSETs are long and hard and there is a lot of material to cover for exams, if you get a good TF it makes the class much more fun. Go to office hours</comment>Good starting foundation for economics</comment>David Johnson is a god. It is sad that future students won't get him. Make sure to transfer into a good section. Do the psets in a timely fashion and the class isn't that hard. I took as a junior and it was very nice and relatively stress-free</comment>Not very hard to get a good grade if you do the work. The material is all basically intuitive.</comment>If you have any interest in economics, you'll love this course.</comment>Seriously consider your GPA before you take this class, as you'll see a large drop simply due to the horrible curves on Economics 10a tests.</comment>If you have good mathematical instincts and have taken the AP, you will probably be better off skipping this course. I took this class because I read the AP textbook and took the exams but have never been in an actual economics class. I would suggest shopping the intermediate level class if you're willing to push yourself a little bit harder. 
Go to lectures. Professor Mankiw reiterated a lot of what is in his textbook in the earlier lectures, but the later ones are more engaging. The guest lectures were about interesting topics even though the lecturers might not be the most charismatic. Personally, I was inspired to read several books about startups, behavioral economics, game theory, and welfare reforms after being exposed to some big questions through sections, guest lectures, optional readings, and problem sets.</comment>It's not a difficult class but will require a few periods of intense work.</comment>It is a necessary burden to study economics. Find students to study with!</comment>It seems like there are two kinds of people who take this class: the ones who find the problem sets difficult but manageable and fun to figure out, and the ones who find the problem sets grueling and the low point of their weeks. This class is I think very necessary in that the general microeconomics principles can be widely applied. However, your enjoyment of the class depends very much upon the quality of your section leader because they are the ones who do the majority of teaching (Mankiw only gives five or six lectures over the course of the semester). For me, all the concepts of the course didn't completely come together until I began studying for the final, mostly because I went to other section leaders as well as because I finally had to break down and teach myself the skills I didn't understand from the section. My advice to anyone who takes this course is to really jump in to it: go to David Johnson's office hours (!!!) and the review sessions of other TFs as well as any office hours you have access to. I found this course incredibly grueling, but if I had employed the same tactics all semester that I did in preparation for the final I think I would have had a greater appreciation for the course.</comment>This course is great! Alot of work definitely but worth it.</comment>This isn't a particularly engaging class, and so you end up digesting a lot of information, often without learning its implications.</comment>I learned a lot in this course, but you will definitely notice that it is a course designed for 600 students to be able to take and succeed in - there is a very generous curve on most exams. Make sure you pay attention in lecture! There will be lecture questions on exams and if you did not listen, you will not know the answers. Those are points that are not worth losing.</comment>Very challenging for some, for others it comes naturally. If you have taken microeconomics before, I strongly recommend, however, those who have not are frankly a step behind.</comment>It's a challenging class but has the unique property of being useful in the understanding of every day life.</comment>David Johnson is awesome! Unfortunately he'll be gone by the time next year's students come around, but nonetheless this course is one of the best and most enriching ones I've taken so far at Harvard.</comment>Ec 10a is a great course.  The sections reinforced what we learned on our own from the textbook.  The greatest strengths of this course were the psets and mid-term review materials.  I now feel I have a strong foundation in micro-economics and a new way to look at many current domestic issues.</comment>Stay on top of your readings and stay engaged in all sections and lectures</comment>I would recommend future students pace themselves and work at understanding concepts gradually and not try to cram all at once.</comment>Your TV will make or break your experience; find a good one early on.</comment>Important if you want to do Ec, or are even thinking about it, but I may not be the greatest experience. Somewhat of a necessary evil</comment>Don't take this class for a Gen Ed. Trust me!</comment>Worth the work</comment>Take it as a sophomore. Seriously.</comment>The class is very straightforward. Read the textbook, do the problems, go to section and lecture, study and you will make it through. Obviously try your best to get a good TF and when in doubt ask other TFs or David Johnson for help. You will learn a lot and many find the material relevant if not interesting.</comment>The experience is definitely what you make it. It depends on your TF, your willingness to engage in participations and attend lectures and above all, to GO TO DAVID JOHNSTON'S OFFICE HOURS! (HINT: everyone should definitely do it!)</comment>People like to complain about Ec10 but it's better than most people say!</comment>Succeeding in the course requires a large time commitment but it is very rewarding.</comment>I strongly recommend this class. Ec10, aside from serving as the foundation course for economics, will change how you think about your life and the world and will make you are more effective citizen.
It is a shame that David Johnson is leaving, though, because he literally made the course. I don't know what it will be like without him.
Try to start the PSets early. They tend to take 5-6 hours. They are not deathly difficult, but are certainly time-consuming.
Go to Mankiw's office hours. He is a very cool guy and highly intelligent: you can definitely learn a lot there (both in terms of material and in the way an expert economist structure his thoughts).</comment>If you get basic math and have some common sense, you'll be fine. Just do the readings and stay on top of it and you'll cruise.</comment>Ec10a does a good job of teaching the foundation of economics. However, because the class is taught primarily in section, the teaching is based on your section leader. The class is pretty easy.</comment>This course was extremely difficult for me due to my selected section leader. He was inexperienced and due to this, I had a hard time understanding the concepts. It all comes down to getting lucky. If you have a decent professor, you will do fine in the class.</comment>This is a good gen ed, you should learn about the world and international trade.</comment>Great introductory economics course, but don't hold your breath for Mankiw lectures.</comment>This class is what you make of it. I have heard all levels of praise and criticism for this class and I honestly think it's because your experience in the class really depends on how much effort you put into it. For example, with the problem sets, really try to figure things out yourself. But if you come across a concept you just don't understand, go to office hours!!!! This is key. I honestly do not know how I could have understood some of the problem sets if I had not gone to David Johnson's office hours. Unfortunately, David Johnson won't be returning as Head TF next year, but nevertheless you should always seek help. The resources are there if you are willing to take advantage of them.</comment>Only really take this class if you need to. Mankiw is awful, the textbook is pretty bad, and section is boring.</comment>This class does a good job of teaching the basic knowledge of economics but it's pretty boring if you don't really like the subject matter.</comment>The problem sets may be challenging,  but they are manageable and essential to your understanding. Also, the application of concepts in problem form is more difficult than one would assume so spend a lot of time practicing and take Unit Exams.</comment>It's a great class if you have no prior experience in economics and are genuinely interested in the field.</comment>Ec10 is an interesting class. If you are looking to understand the math behind economics, then this is not the class for you.</comment>If you haven't taken ec before, you'll learn a lot.  Make sure you get a good section TF or switch sections until you do, it'll make a huge difference.  The curve is super nice- do average on the exams and take the Unit Tests and you'll get an A-.</comment>It is definitely a good class to take to get a good understanding of economics.</comment>Can be kinda dull sometimes, but I learned a lot and it's all stuff that you should know before you go out in the real world</comment>This is a great course, I wouldnt recommemend skipping</comment>If you are interested in economics as a potential concentration, take this.  If you are interested in economics more generally (i.e. want to be more economically literate), consider taking this.  Otherwise...not really a "fun" class.</comment>make sure to get help from your TF if you've never taken econ before</comment>its a useful course, but also somewhat rigorous.</comment>Yeah, this class can be somewhat annoying sometimes. But let's face it, economics is important to know in today's world. This class is effective at teaching it, so students should take it. And it's not that bad, the problem sets are gone over in office hours and if you study seriously for the tests you will do fine considering the curve.</comment>Not very good teaching. Have to do a lot of learning independently.</comment>This course build good foundations to do basically anything in any field.</comment>It is very difficult but you learn a lot.</comment>Econ 10 is a great class. Lectures are interesting and topics learned in this course help you better understand policies about the economy</comment>With David Johnson running the class, Ec10 was incredible. He was so fiercely intelligent and caring about his students and the class. I'm not sure what it will be like without him. Lectures are scarce, and not too informative. Section is completely hit or miss. But you will absolutely learn the principles of microeconomics if you take this course, no matter who the head teaching fellow is. Just beware that the Q guide might not give an accurate reflection of the class because the class' heart and soul, David Johnson, is unfortunately leaving.</comment>Take this class if you are prepared to think independently about the information presented and not to accept every theory as fact. Also, the work load is very manageable.</comment>study lectures, but you don't really need to go</comment>You will learn some economics. You will be frustrated sometimes by the rather dogmatic views held by the Mank. You will take a few exams and do a bunch of problem sets. You'll have more fun elsewhere, but like me, you probably have to take this.</comment>It's a great class. I had a great section TF, so I really enjoyed it and I learned a lot. Lectures vary between being very interesting and quite dull. You won't get taught by Mankiw other than about 4 lectures.</comment>It's very hard, but you will really learn a lot about economics.</comment>Do all the practice problems for the exams, they are challenging, but it is an interesting class</comment>This class is the capitalist machine and they're not even shy about it. Take it
to know how an economist thinks though because that has a lot of utility and the opportunity cost... Oh no. They got to me! Save yourselves!</comment>This class is a pretty standard introduction to micro-economics. It is mostly taught in sections. As long as you go to section and pay attention, you will not feel lost. Go to lectures because while they are not central to the exams, there will be multiple choice questions about them.</comment>This is a wonderful course for people thinking about concentrating economics or not! I recommend you take it to understand the foundation of economics.</comment>Ec 10a is a good class that could be a phenomenal class. The material is actually quite interesting, and  some of the TF's are very good, but I had a very poor TF experience. From my perspective, I'd have preferred to have David Johnson (who is a phenomenal teacher!) teach the content covered in section, in a lecture format. As for the existing lectures, they're quite interesting!</comment>I could not imagine a more poorly taught course. Section is a complete waste. The material from the book is recited in the same way it was presented originally. Take it if you have to.</comment>Rather unexpectedly, Ec10a ended up being the course that I learned the most from freshman fall. Ec10a provides a broad introduction to the major concepts in microeconomics. The textbook is really very well-written, and David Johnson, while crazy, is brilliant. If you're interested in learning more about "the economy" (which, before I came to Harvard, was an abstract, unclear concept) and how politics is involved in the economy, this is the course for you. It's not hard, but psets can be annoying -- definitely find someone to work with, because it makes the work go faster.</comment>If you've taken AP Microeconomics, take a higher level course because this course will not be challenging nor rewarding. Most of the course will be review. Also, your experience with the course depends highly on the section leader that you get assigned.</comment>Read the book.</comment>This is a good class to take, regardless if you're planning to concentrate in Economics, since it touches on many microeconomic concepts that are ubiquitous in today's news and debates.</comment>Definitely take this class! Especially if you are interested in politics or public policy. This course is interesting, engaging, and not excessively time-consuming. It is also very relevant to the real world and may give you deeper insight into the world and into economic policies! Would recommend 10/10</comment>I really liked this course-- it gave me very strong foundations on economics. However, I sometimes feel that the TF's are not well prepared and that there is a lack of communication between the course heads and the TF's.</comment>I enjoyed learning the material in this class. Just try to keep on top of things because it's hard to catch up since a lot of the material is cumulative. Go to office hours.</comment>Good way to get a gen ed out of the way and also it's just good to take ec10 but it was pretty boring. Wasn't that difficult, but a bad TF can really change the course.</comment>If you are interested in economics, but have never taken an economics course before, take this course to see if you might want to pursue the topic in the future.</comment>Take Ec10a! Ec 10a is difficult, but well worth it because the class gives you some critical life skills and information. How much you get out of section depends on how competent your TF is, but it is still possible to do well without a good TF if you spend a lot of time outside of class going over concepts. You'll be in a better position if you've had some preview of microeconomics before taking the class.</comment>This class was a miserable experience. Only take it if you have to.</comment>Just sit tight and wait till it's over. The skills it provides are necessary to any understanding of economics; with that, though, comes the fact that there are 800 people all in the same boat. Microeconomics is far less interesting than macro, but in order to take the latter, I would recommend the former. Ec10 is type of course that makes many critics of Harvard accuse us of not prioritizing undergraduate studies. Though such a statement is far from the actual truth, my experience with Ec10 is that it is part of a minority of courses whose goals do not include fostering intimate learning.</comment>Take this class! Even if you have no intention of concentrating in economics, this class teaches you the basics of economics that are useful for a better understanding of the basics of our economy</comment>This class is very good especially when you collaborate on the psets. Not only does it offset the workload but it also helps in terms of group learning.</comment>I hope Economics is not about Ec10</comment>It's not a perfect class at all -- lectures are disappointing and your experience will hugely hinge on your TF. That said, the things you learn in EC10a are things any informed citizen should know. Don't let the imperfect environment in which you learn them deter you.</comment>It's a great course! It is not easy but you learn so much. Economics is important for everyone to study because it is very practical and applicable to everyone's life. It is true, you will probably not see Professor Mankiw often but that's certainly not a negative. Economics really should be taught in small sections because of the nature of the material. Also the guest lectures introduce really interesting more advanced economic topics which helps to put the basics into perspective. This class is definitely worth the work!</comment>I took this class a GenEd, but I now believe that economics will be my concentration. The concepts seem basic, but if you learn and enjoy the material, you can explore a whole range of issues from a different perspective.</comment>Don't take this class if you are interested in Mankiw; he won't really be there. Take this class if you're interested in economics.</comment>Ec10 is an awesome opportunity to develop a strong base of understanding in economics while also learning to problem solve and think critically. You truly get as much out of this class as you put in, and if you are dedicated to putting in the time and working with the course material, this class will be a very valuable and memorable academic experience for you!</comment>Read the textbook and listen in section, but be prepared to apply the basic concepts strenuously to complete the problem sets. Going to office hours is imperative to success.</comment>As a liberal, did not enjoy the abundance of conservative philosophy embedded in the course or Mankiw himself. I did learn a lot though.</comment>I went from loving the theory of economics to absolutely despising it.</comment>Do your problem sets early, and go to David Johnson's office hours.</comment>This course probably epitomizes the common belief that at Harvard "you'll never meet or be taught by a  professor." Unfortunately, lectures are infrequent and very rare, especially lectures with Mankiw himself. The subject material is interesting, and entirely depends on your section TF. Problem sets take a long time, and if you don't go to office hours I truly don't know how you can complete them successfully, especially since problem solving is not taught in section, and certainly not in lecture.</comment>Good course that teaches you all of the basics on microeconomics that one can then build off of later.</comment>Great for those who never took Ec and are interested in the material/ want something resembling some sort of business class. A good TF is key and the curve is generous.</comment>If you can get Josh Bookin as a TF, you will be set. Even though Ec10 as a class is prone to making you feel anonymous, he takes the time to not only learn everyone's name, but also is incredibly open and helpful both in and outside of section. He's an incredible teacher who made the material (which at times was very hard to understand at first) quite accessible.</comment>The tests and Psets are well written but the sections and the way the course is taught, from a textbook is not the most engaging or genuinely interesting way</comment>Take it seriously and it wont be too hard.</comment>Entirely depends on how good your section leader is. I worry for this course after David Johnson has left.</comment>Greg Mankiw</comment>Economics is a vast and fascinating field, and this course introduces you to many important concepts. However, since the class is so huge, it often feels impersonal and somewhat rushed. You learn mostly from Unit tests and P-sets, which can be very time consuming.</comment>This class is all about your TF, so do your best to get into a good TF's section. David Johnson is unfortunately leaving Harvard, so I'm not sure who the best TF will be. However, if you're hesitant at all about your TF during the first week or two, don't be afraid to switch because that will make all the difference as the semester wears on and the material gets more complicated.</comment>Doing the reading from Mankiw's book will help you! Many students don't bother to do it, and could have benefited from it.</comment>Go to David Johnson's office hours.</comment>While this class is a great one to take as a freshman due to it's introductory approach to the concepts of economics and the manageable workload, I would caution that anyone without any prior knowledge of economics may find themselves struggling slightly.</comment>It makes you think in a different and useful way that will be helpful to your future and present life.</comment>- one's Ec 10 experience depends on how much work one is willing to put in</comment>It's a grind but it will inform the way you think about the world.</comment>Ec10 is a great class with a ton of resources to absorb the curriculum if you stay on top of the work and take advantage of those resources (office hours, unit tests, helpful hints, etc.). You have to be more actively engaged in the class than you might think (from the large lectures and section sizes)- it's a very individual experience and about how much initiative you take to use the course's resources.</comment>If you take this class, get ready to put in work! This class can come with frustrations and I recommend that you do not take it with two problem-set classes. Go to section, ask multiple TFs for help (not just yours), work on it with friends, read/skim the textbook, read study guides, take advantage of the helpful hints... JUST MAKE SURE THAT YOU DO EVERYTHING TO NOT FALL BEHIND IN THIS COURSE! Because the process of catching up is not fun.</comment>It is a solid class and teaches a great basis of economic theory.</comment>Very useful foundational course.</comment>This course isn't that interesting, but it is necessary to have an understanding of the fundamental concepts in economics before one goes on to higher-level courses.</comment>After taking this class, you will have a solid understanding of basic economics. How much individual work you need to put in to achieve this is somewhat determined by how helpful/prepared your TF is during classes and office hours. The problem sets are fairly hard, but if you go to office hours for help they are much more manageable. The unit-test program is amazing and you should take advantage of it.</comment>This is a difficult course.  However, I came out with a much better understanding of economics.  (Although my previous knowledge was non-existent.)</comment>This isn't an "easy" class, but if you put the time in it can be very rewarding.</comment>This class is a good introduction to economics. it is helpful is you have a background in economics first though. Make sure you ask a lot of questions and do practice questions!!</comment>Do the unit tests, they really help you make sure you understand the material and stay on top of things. Plus the extra grade boost is nice. One nice part about the psets is that there are always a bunch of people working on them so you always have friends you can ask. Don't work on psets alone!! Friends make it easier and more fun.</comment>If you have no experience in economics, this is the course to take to learn about the subject.</comment>Very questionable section teaching and lecture material is tested but can learned from reading slides so lectures are not worth going to (Cutler and Laibson are great though).</comment>Do not fall behind</comment>To take this class, you have to be ready to dedicate substantial time to the thorough completion of readings and problem sets. However, the course material is very interesting, and all of the TFs are very accessible and very willing to answer any questions you have. If you take the time to understand the concepts, the exams, although difficult, are manageable. I highly recommend this course!!</comment>really depends on the TF you get</comment>I loved the class, I had never done anything like economics before and thought it was fascinating. Don't listen to the people who say they didn't like it!</comment>Take it if you have to, I suppose.</comment>Ec10a and Ec10b are very useful classes if you desire to be an informed citizen. While 10a can seem like an oversimplification at times, it (along with Ec10b) gives students some critical basic economics knowledge. Make sure you have a good TF - if you do not, switch immediately.</comment>This class sucks. The section leaders for the most part aren't able to teach. Mankiw is snobby and racist and teh guest lecturers were no better.</comment>It's necessary for a lot of things. Just gotta deal with it. Not too bad if your section leader is good.</comment>If you have the right section leader, this course could be extremely enjoyable.</comment>Good introduction to Microeconomics, but nothing too exciting. The class is definitely dry but it teaches you everything you need to know to decide whether or not you want to concentrate in Economics.</comment>many people just have to take ec to get a secondary or concentrate in it. If you are not doing one of those two do not take it</comment>I think one thing you need to realize with this class is that it is suited for those who have taken econ before. It does not mean that it makes this course easier if you do have a background, but it means be prepared to work very hard. This course is not easy, especially if economics does not come naturally. Don't hesitate to go to your TF's office hours or another TF's hours. Also, don't hesitate to find a tutor. Honestly, don't worry if you do bad on your tests. There is a curve and many opportunities for you to get help. However, if you feel like after one semester the class isn't for you that is totally okay.</comment>How much you end up learning from this class completely depends on the caliber of your TF. Pray for a knowledgable TF come sectioning time! The guest lecturers tend to be very interesting, informative, and related to relavant social/economic issues. Mankiw's lecture are not as exciting.</comment>Ec 10 will teach you how to think in a new way and look at the world differently</comment>It was a very interesting and enjoyable class and a great introduction to microeconomics</comment>The content presented is very good and provides a good introduction to economics. Your experience will most likely depend on what section you are placed into as the content is entirely taught in section. If you haven't taken economics before I would be prepared to do some additional study each week.</comment>As a sophomore in ec10, I really enjoyed it.  It's straightforward, it's manageable, and it's interesting.  There is no confusion around what is expected of you, and there are no surprises in ec10.  There are many resources available in ec10: varied office hours and unit tests are especially helpful.  Take it!  Even if you aren't planning on concentrating in economics, it's a good class to have taken.</comment>Even though the course instructor is professor Mankiw, you do not see him more than three times, therefore I recommend you to resection immediately if you are not satisfied with your TF's performance, since your liking of the course is very dependent on your TF's way of teaching. I was not content with my TF, Jay Weng, at all, which made the course very disappointing for me. Overall the material of the course generates a good understanding of the neoclassical economic systems which play a very significant role in understanding how the world works today. The PSets are very long and time consuming, so be prepared for long nights working on Econ.</comment>I only took Ec10 because it's required for my possible concentration. I thought that I would hate it, so I wanted to get my one semester of econ out of the way as soon as possible. Turns out, I really enjoyed it! Will be back for more with Ec10b in the spring. It's very logical and intuitive, and it can be very rewarding to gain insights on so many aspects that affect the world around us. Lectures are boring and pretty unnecessary, except for some excellent guest lecturers, but if you have an engaging TF, the material can be really interesting and not too challenging.</comment>This course is well taught and well organized. How difficult you will find it depends a lot on your experience with logic and your math ability. You don't need a lot of math, but you need to be proficient at algebra, otherwise this course will seem very difficult.</comment>Decent amount of work but very rewarding!</comment>take it if want to do ec</comment>Read the textbook.</comment>If you take this class don't take it because you think the great Greg Mankiw will be teaching it! He has nothing (I wish i could bold that) to do with the actual course.</comment>Even though I took it because it is a requirement for economics concentrators, I would definitely recommend it as an elective or for Gen Ed credit. It's a really good class to get a thorough understanding of the basis of economics. It also gives you a different way of thinking about the world.</comment>Pay attention in section and do the unit tests!</comment>Mankiw hardly lectures, unfair grading system, unrealistically hard problem sets, learned a lot though</comment>Studying for tests doesn't seem to help grades as much as it should.</comment>Difficult but does give you an understanding that is useful in everyday life.</comment>Read the textbook because TFs and section are not particularly helpful. Lectures and extra readings are not relatively important for exams.</comment>It's definitely interesting from a non-concentrator point of view. However, it is a very time-consuming class and the material is often a little difficult.</comment>If your section leader is bad, switch, it makes all the difference. Use the helpful hints, they and the problem sets will get you used to the way test questions are asked--same flow/format etc.</comment>This class was very informative overall.</comment>Ask someone for a PDF version of an older version of the textbook. The price of the current edition is outrageous.</comment>Taking this course is a great way to find out if you are interested in economics. If you have taken AP Economics in high school, most of the material in this course will be a review, but I still recommend taking it because of the emphasis that this course places on math rather than on concepts.</comment>It is a great way of learning how the world is run.</comment>Take it if you are interested in econ at all. Can be boring and difficult but it is clear that the ideas apply to the real world as evidenced in lectures.</comment>Its really hard and very stressful</comment>Basically your performance is tied with your TF's performance.</comment>This class is an introductory ec class. If I could go back I probably wouldn't take this course again but I don't know. Everyone should take some introductory economics.</comment>People often have negative views about Ec 10a but I honestly think it is a close that is worth taking. You get out of it what you put into it and if you put in the time it is a very rewarding class.</comment>It's not that interesting. Kind of generic.</comment>Ec10a is a course that applies to multiple fields and provides you with a strong foundation for Ec10b and beyond, so you will find that this course will help you a lot in the future. I advise that you always attend the lectures and read the textbook to get the most out of it. The course is designed for those who havn't taken economics before, but if you have already taken it in high school, then that knowledge would be useful background for you.</comment>It might seem easy in the beginning but make sure you keep paying attention because it gets significantly harder. Also, go to the unit tests. Even if you don't know anything, going over them is really helpful and will help prepare you for the exams. Read the book, it makes things so much easier.</comment>It's the big intro ec class - important for any potential ec concentrators to take.  You have to put in the work to do well but it's not too hard to do well. Make sure you study a lot for the 2nd midterm because it's much harder than the first.</comment>Very boring material. Most likely due to the tf I had, and I had friends who said their tfs did a great job. So how much you like the class will absolutely depend on the tf you have.</comment>Just about everyone winds up taking Ec10 at some point, and though the course is flawed, it still manages to convey the basic principles of the field.  Since the world basically runs on economics, this course will help you to be a functional citizen.  But you're not going to enjoy it unless you're a soulless libertarian robot.</comment>The course takes a lot of work. The more interested you are in course material and connect it with real life problems the easier course gets.</comment>Take this course if you're interested in ec -- you kind of have to. As a gen ed it wouldn't be a bad course, though maybe more work than necessary and it can be dry. Don't take it for Mankiw because he only lectures a few times. Also buy the old edition textbook, it's the same as the new one and it's $300 cheaper.</comment>It's a standard intro to economics course. They teach you a lot of stuff in terms of graphs and lines and algebra.</comment>Good intro class to take if you're an economics concentrator, but be prepared for a lot of self-teaching</comment>If you want to broaden your perspective on politics take this course.</comment>This course will help one understand important and fundamental economic concepts. It encourages one to use a variety of approaches in the pursuit of this knowledge. It is fun while being interesting at the same time.</comment>Mankiw is a character.  If anything, take the course for him.  Entertaining and informative.</comment>It's a class every student should take</comment>Read the textbook before section as you go. It would make studying for midterms and the final much easier. Go to office hours!!!!</comment>If you don't have an understanding of economics going into the course, this course is difficult and poorly structured.  Also it's hard to imagine anyone truly enjoying the course with any tf other than David Johnson.</comment>This class can be great if you get a good section teacher. If not, it can be pretty frustrating, but still good. Lectures, however, are very good and interesting. Also the textbook is very straightforward.</comment>This is a good course for anyone looking to get a better understanding of how the US and world economies work. As an introduction course, however, it only skates on the surface of a lot of interesting topics. The class is also very manageable in terms of time and difficulty. Your experience in the course depends a lot on what TF you get for section, so if your TF isn't great, I'd recommend switching early on.</comment>Keep up with the readings.</comment>Pay attention to lectures.</comment>It's a worthwhile course.  You have to take the initiative to go to OH and take unit tests if you (1) have a poor TF and (2) want to do well in the course.</comment>It's useful, no doubt, but in the same way that eating spinach and broccoli is useful when you're growing up: in hindsight, you're glad you got that fiber, but it could've been shoved down your throat in a much more palatable way.</comment>Always do the exam review materials and make use of your TF's office hours for help on the more advanced concepts in the Psets and on the exam review materials.</comment>Taking this course has proved to be the best decision I've made this year.  Basic economic knowledge is essential to understanding how society works and how to make society better.  I had no experience in economics before this class, but now Economics is my number one concentration option.</comment>Very good class. You learn a lot about economics, but also about government and public policy.</comment>Unless you are taking this class to fulfill a concentration requirement I would avoid it. It is a solid introduction into the material but i would not describe it as the most fulfilling class.</comment>Take this course to have a better understanding of the world and why it works the way that it does.</comment>Very important for understanding the dynamics of human exchange</comment>Iconic class, why not take it?  Basic economic principles useful in everyday life.</comment>It's fun and useful!!!</comment>It's a pretty good class. Not fantastic. It's very dumbed down, but that's necessary for an introductory course. Get started on your psets early in the week (i.e. not before Thursday night) or else you'll drown.</comment>I would say that learning how to think in terms of economics is useful, but that the course itself is flawed.</comment>This is a good class to take for anyone who is interested in Economics, but most of the lectures and the sections don't provide any additional information on what can be found in Mankiw book.</comment>This is a very good introductory course to economics.  Lectures are generally unhelpful, but David Johnson is amazing.</comment>The material is pretty boring, but you'll feel better about your understanding of the world when it's all over. Don't bother with the textbook, just pay attention in section, go to the course-wide reviews, and watch the occasional YouTube clip if you don't get it. Work with a partner.</comment>Well it is the only option, so you have to take it. I would tell people to definitely keep up with their work and make sure that they understand key concepts soon after they are introduced, as if you wait too long you will have much more trouble. Definitely keep up with the readings.</comment>Read for understanding not memorization! Synthesis synthesis synthesis. All of the concepts build upon each other so if you skip the first few chapters because you think they're simple you will have a  rocky foundation. Go to officer hours for help not answers, you should have at least tried something on your own. Do all the practice tests.</comment>The class can be extremely rewarding and interesting or not depending on your effort.</comment>I enjoyed it, and it will definitely tell you if economics is the field for you.</comment>make sure to understand the material and not put it off for a later date</comment>Not a class you can just blow off, particularly if you have never had previous experience with ec before. Not an easy gened!</comment>Switch out of a section with a bad TF</comment>Excellent course overall.  One will feel incredibly accomplished at the end of the semester for ones increased problem solving capabilities and more flexible way of thinking.  Information is applicable to everyday life, so the course is great for people intending to concentrate in the subject or just taking it out of personal interest.</comment>Be prepared to be challenged and have your eyes opened to this world. Very interesting and mind blowing stuff.</comment>Highly dependent on TF quality (I was lucky, but from what I've heard from others).</comment>Best advice I can give is to make sure you are happy with your TF. Having a bad TF will ruin the learning experience for you.</comment>This course is wonderful as long as you have a TF who is enthusiastic and knowledgable about the course material.</comment>You're probably going to have to take this class to fulfill a requirement. It's tough that the course depends so heavily on the quality of your TF, but you'll at least learn something from it by the end. Not sure how it'll go without David Johnson though.</comment>This class might not be the most exciting course at Harvard, but it does build a strong foundation of basic economics knowledge. I feel that I am prepared to pursue future studies in the subject.</comment>This is an awesome course!  The material is very interesting and the teachers are great.  It really opens your eyes to how the world works around you and how people make decisions.  No previous economics background is necessary to take the course.</comment>This course has problem sets that will take you a long time, exams that are tricky and really require you to think deeply and critically about applying concepts, and lectures that are often boring and/or biased and/or irrelevant to the rest of the course. However, it does teach you a lot about economic principles and gives a solid basis for understanding some policies and markets. David Johnson is an awesome teacher and you should go to his office hours and review sessions to clarify topics, especially if your section leader is not on point (and many are not).</comment>Although this class sometimes gets a bad name, I found it to be one of the most enlightening experiences I have had during my three years at Harvard so far.</comment>The experience you have depends greatly on your TF. It is a great way to learn the basics.</comment>Don't take this class because everyone else is taking it.</comment>As someone who had never before taken an economics class, I found this course to be a very enjoyable introduction to the subject. The material was the right balance of challenging and manageable, which I appreciated.</comment>Try to take Ec 1010 if you have any prior Ec experience at all.</comment>The psets are challenging and quite often only distantly related to section and lecture. However, they provide you the opportunity to creatively apply what you've learned and to view the material in new lights. This is a great course if you have any interest in the field at all.</comment>It is a useful course and a smart choice to take it.</comment>It's necessary.</comment>Definitely worth taking, especially if you've never studied economics before. It'll change the way you look at a lot of institutions and processes and that's pretty cool. The TFs are generally pretty strong (mine was great) and the exams and material hard but rewarding if you put in solid work. I think having a ec background is super important, so it was totally worth it to me. Just be aware: Mankiw is not super helpful, nor a very good lecturer, and he does have a political bias - it's not too bade but it helps to take his lectures with a bit of a grain of salt.</comment>I think you should only take this if you're considering being an economics concentrator. I think there are much better classes if you'd like to fulfill the General Education Requirement. Also, you might want to do the readings as I think this class will be a lot worse without David Johnson, he's a bro.</comment>I think it is extremely important to learn the material covered in this class, as it genuinely explained a lot of things about how the world works to me in areas that I didn't even realise I had a deficiency in my understanding in, but I felt that it was a poorly designed course, which made covering the material much more painful to go through than it should have. Also, the fact that the people who do best in this course are those who have already taken some Economics, or spend a lot of extra time on their own on the material, would suggest that the course is not effective. I would therefore consider Ec10 a necessary evil.</comment>It's not very engaging unless you are a concentrator or into economics</comment>ec10a was a good class. Decently well run. I believe it depends on who the TF you get is.</comment>Attend all of David Johnson's office hours.</comment>Everyone should take introductory economics. It is fundamental to understanding the modern world in which we live.</comment>Your experience really depends on the section leader you get. Even the curves depend on your exam/ section group, so there's nothing much you can do.</comment>Make use of the optional unit exams, they help a lot in solidifying your understanding of the material</comment>Reasonably interesting!</comment>it't not too hard but going to section is annoying</comment>Valuable if interested in economics, but a significant time/effort commitment, and not many lectures.</comment>Very bread-and-butter intro economics class. Makes you feel like you're in a large public school with huge lecturers and half the school taking the course. But you learn what's necessary.</comment>Start the P.sets as soon as you get the chance, go to lectures and section, GO TO OFFICE HOURS, read the book, and you should be just fine.</comment>This class is really hard. Unless you are very serious about economics or have taken the course before, I wouldn't recommend it.</comment>Very difficult class but definitely worth it.  You learn a lot about how the world works.  A lot of important info that you will carry with you.  Even if you are not considering concentrating or getting a secondary in economics, everyone should take this class.  Psets and exams are really difficult but the curve is generous.</comment>David Johnson is the strength of this class. He is literally amazing. He has so many office hours and makes himself available for the students. His explanations and enthusiasm for the subject matter is really inspiring and comprehensive. What I got out of this class came out from the few times I went to his review sessions or office hours.That being said...very few people are lucky enough to get into David Johnson's section. How your semester goes really will be based on whom you get as a TF. Anyone can do well in the class by getting extra help but how much extra work you put in will depend on your TF.</comment>I took this class as a junior which was both a great and terrible decision. It was great because I know more about what I want to get out of my time at Harvard, so I was less stressed about each problem set and could see the big picture without focusing on each week's assignments and readings. It was terrible because I wish I had taken it earlier. I declared a different concentration, and at this point, I do not have enough time to switch my concentration. Had I taken it freshman or sophomore year, I would have declared Economics. I recommend taking it sophomore year. It is a stressful class to take as a freshman, but don't take it too late. It's incredible, and taking Ec10 was one of the best decisions I've made at Harvard.</comment>You learn valuable information in this course, but the exams are very difficult.</comment>Just keep up with the readings and go to section.  Section teaches you a majority of the information so don't skip out on it.  Also, make sure to go to office hours. They are a lifesaver for the psets as well as the exams.</comment>Course structure needs work but course content is good.</comment>If you are interested in the material, it is a great course to take. It will also be useful in the future, so it's never a bad decision. However if you know you don't want to concentrate in economics, it might not be the best choice.</comment>Ec10a with Greg Mankiw is a good intro to the field of Economics. It gives a solid foundation for those wishing to concentrate in the subject, and it gives a good taste to those simply wishing to know a little about Economics. Ec10a does an excellent job of teaching students to "think at the margin" and view their actions and decisions from an economic perspective.</comment>I would highly recommend this course to all students. This course significantly raised my understanding of the world around me and gave me specific tools for analysis. I now have better knowledge to tackle the news and current events with and have applied the fundamentals of economics in all of my other classes this semester across various disciplines. Although this class is not extremely difficult, it does require lots of time, thought, and energy. Problem sets and unit tests are key for comprehension and thus need to be taken seriously.</comment>A must-take if you haven't already taken AP Microeconomics in high school. As cliche as it sounds, it's true- economics is such a powerful factor that shapes our day-to-day lives, so understanding it is key to becoming a more informed individual and citizen. The workload is relatively light (consisting only of 6 required problem sets and 3 exams for the whole semester) and if you have good quantitative reasoning skills then this class should be enjoyable and relatively straightforward. That being said, your experience in Ec 10 largely depends on your section leader since the vast majority of the course is taught in section, and I have heard that there is a wide variety in quality among the different section leaders. However, mine was excellent and so I found the course to be very enjoyable. Also- take the unit tests!!!</comment>As a class that is stereotypically full of freshman, it can still be pretty tough. If you have any interest in economics, it's definitely worth taking though. Make sure to find a section leader you like though, because the majority of the class is taught in section. Only a handful of lectures, but don't make the mistake of not going to any of them, because a lot more lecture questions appear on exams than you'd think.</comment>Do the problem sets by yourself and make sure you fully understand what you are doing.</comment>Difficult, but necessary for greater understanding of society. Even if this is not a concentration requirement, it is very applicable to many different fields.</comment>Ec10a was better than I expected it, and better than its reputation. The material is pretty important for everyone in general to understand. You should understand it is a section-based course, and it would be a mistake to expect a lecture course by Mankiw (who lectured about 6 times). Because of this, it might feel more like a high school course. Beware of your section leader's shortcomings.</comment>Great preparation for life in general. Economics makes just reading articles (the paper is for chumps) much more enjoyable</comment>Move out of your section as soon as possible if you have a very poor teaching fellow.</comment>This class is not going to be easy! Be prepared to spend lots of time outside class studying, processing, practicing, and trying to understand the material -- problem sets are notoriously stymieing. Lectures are few and far between and sections are very much a gamble. Overall the material is informative and useful, but the concepts and class structure are tough.</comment>The textbook is not enough</comment>Unless you have taken economics before (and maybe even if you have), this class is hard work, but there are many resources in place to help you out. Just make sure that you can set aside the time to take advantage of them all: TF's office hours, Unit Tests, optional psets, etc. All worth doing.</comment>Take the unit tests, keep up with the readings, and go to David Johnson's office hours when you have questions. If you can stay on top of the material, the class is really straightforward, simple, and a nice way of knocking out the Empirical Reasoning GenEd. Also look at the past exams and problems sets, because the majority of exam questions are directly ripped from/slightly modified versions of questions from previous tests and homework.</comment>It is necessary in order to pursue a concentration in Economics, but even if you're not, the knowledge it gives you is very useful and applicable to every day life.</comment>If you want to be an economics major, you have to take it. That said, EC 10 is fairly difficult and if you don't keep up, it can quickly become overwhelming. Do your homework, go to section, GO TO LECTURES, and take notes.</comment>The class is easy but you have to teach yourself the material and go to David Johnson's office hours because the section TFs aren't very good.</comment>Ec 10 is a classic huge course. The material is basic, with limited engagement from faculty and a disconnected feel. Your satisfaction in this course is entirely dependent upon who your section leader is and whether or not you're actually interested in any of the material being covered. Even if you feel like you have a great grasp of the material and kill it on the problem sets, you may be set up for disappointment on the exams. Standards are vague and inconsistent.</comment>Okay, so, you're not taking this class because you particularly want to take Ec 10. You take it because you have to - either to be an Ec concentrator or because your other social science requires it, or because your academic advisor is somewhat dull in the head. Either way, it's not going to be a particularly pleasant experience. Work in section is straightforward-enough, problem sets are somewhat challenging, but perfectly fine if you go to office hours. Exams are tricky, to make a distinction in ability among the giant class. Make sure to study. Take it if you must, but certainly place out if you have AP scores.</comment>Make sure you take advantage of office hours and extra help sessions, even if they happen to be with various TFs</comment>Much of Ec10's successes or failures come from the ability of your TF.  I was fortunate enough to have a spectacular TF, which means I had a spectacular experience.  At the same time, however, some of my roommates had TFs that were not as great, and they did not have as great an experience as I did.  If all TFs were at the same level, I would have no issue recommending with enthusiasm.  The course is a great introduction to economics for those without a prior background, and I had a great time learning about it.</comment>You should take this course. Yes, it's hard. Yes, it's impersonal. But you do learn, and you learn a lot. Not just economics, but how to think. Everyone should HAVE to take this course.</comment>This course gives a good foundation of economics but sometimes the topics and important concepts get lost along the way. Although not necessary, having some sort of an economics background is extremely helpful. Even just studying some things on your own beforehand might make this course a little easier.</comment>If you take one class at Harvard, this should be it. A basic understanding of economics is the obligation of every participating citizen in this country.</comment>It's a decent amount of work but is not that difficult. The class often seems tedious, but is nonetheless fairly useful.</comment>read the textbook</comment>The class is certainly useful for understanding basic economic principles that will be useful for all students regardless of their future occupations.</comment>If you have taken economics before go for it! If not, take this with friends</comment>Enjoy it. It's awesome.</comment>I actually don't mind it, but I feel like that is because of my TF more than anything. It is an okay course.</comment>Tough class but if you apply yourself it's very rewarding.</comment>It's a good way to learn Microeconomics</comment>It is a very thought provoking class that let's you view the world in a much more analytical way. It forces you to think outside the box and this concept is very enjoyable for many students as myself. Problem sets are engaging and relevant. The only complaint I have is how impersonal Mankiw is with the class. He rarely lectures and barely teaches anything. Everything is done by our TFs. David Johnson (Head TF) is a boss but he's leaving so econ will be slightly different next year.</comment>This course teaches a lot of material in a way that enables students to synthesize it all (or at least most of it).  David Johnson is a fantastic course head who is willing to go above and beyond to help students understand topics in his office hours and review sessions.  He is truly an amazing teacher and cares about students rather than research (and it is too bad he is leaving).  The fact that there were some very impressive guest lecturers in addition to the regular sections was useful in terms of understanding the topics in the book through section and then hearing about applications of these ideas in lecture.  The problem sets could also be done in groups, which is great if you have a lot of other work to do and can split the work up with a friend or two in section and then go over it together.  I feel that I now have a much better understanding of microeconomics.</comment>You learn a lot about economics from the course.</comment>It will open your mind to previously unthought of possibilities</comment>Go to office hours!!!!!</comment>Ec10: A giant conspiracy formulated by Greg Mankiw to get a bunch of saps to buy his $200 textbook</comment>Take this course if you have to; avoid it if you don't.</comment>Unless you get a good TF, it is very hard to learn effectively in this class. Most learning I did was on my own outside of the section.</comment>The class is necessary for the Ec concentration, but by no means expect a fun or entertaining class. It's basic Ec, and nothing more.</comment>It is an interesting class that made me consider switching my concentration to economics.</comment>It's not that interesting a topic in general but it does provide the necessary background to go on in economics i think.</comment>Good stuff to know but not taught very well</comment>The course is difficult but manageable</comment>This class isn't that hard if you take the time to learn the materials, but this is especially important if you don't have a good TF.</comment>it is not the most fun course, but you do learn a lot.</comment>It is a great class and in order to do well it is important to stay up to date on the readings</comment>It's a pretty interesting class. If you are interested in concentrating in economics, you'll have to take it anyway.</comment>It won't blow your mind or change the way you think (at least it didn't for me), but you'll learn about economic modeling and microeconomic theory.</comment>They try their best to make introductory economics not mundane.</comment>work HARD. put in a lot of time.</comment>This course is not a great course because essentially all the material is taught in section by graduate students so your experience really depends on your section tf. The lectures are an interesting supplement to section as you apply the material to the actual world. Take this course because you have no choice if you want to move up to higher level economics courses taught by actual professors.</comment>I wouldn't take this class unless you really really liked economics or it's a requirement.</comment>This class is the foundation of economics, which is the foundation of the world's functionality.</comment>Take this class. It's interesting and provides the important base you need for further study in economics.</comment>Difficult but worth it.</comment>I would tell them that this course to take to be a well informed citizen and not be ignorant of important issues that are heavily related to the field of economics.</comment>If you are interested in working on Wall Street, this class is largely irrelevant to such a profession.  In fact, the field of Economics seems to only have relevance in the public sector and consists of mostly abstract concepts.  So, if you have taken Ec prior and disliked it, I can't say that this class will be enjoyable for you.  Don't just take this course because you think it will signal a future interest in working in finance, take it if you are genuinely interested in the subject.</comment>Understand that you won't get taught by actual professors most of the time</comment>N/A</comment>go to office hours</comment>Be wary of the workload</comment>Exams hard, material interesting if you like math</comment>I never thought that I would enjoy an economics class but Ec10 is very engaging and applicable to real world problems. It gives you a good foundation for evaluating economic policy. The problem sets are challenging but very effective in making sure you can apply the concepts. The tests are fair evaluations of what you learn. David Johnson is super enthusiastic and engaging.</comment></course>SOCIOL 206: The Sociology of Development: Seminar</title>If you're interested in economic development, this seminar is a chance to learn the literature on the subject, and to engage in a serious conversation with other students. I highly recommend it.</comment></course>ENGLISH Cnnr: Advanced Creative Nonfiction: Workshop</title>Definitely take this course if you can. Darcy is amazing and it will help you grow tremendously as a writer. Also just a lot of fun.</comment>Everybody comes in thinking they're a good writer. Everybody leaves realizing they have long, long ways to go. This isn't because Darcy or the peer editing process destroy you, it's because the class opens your mind to all the techniques and structures and reasons for writing you haven't yet mastered. You'll cover great literature; you'll receive great feedback (a huge component of the class is how insightful your peers will be); you'll love it.</comment>This isn't your typical creative writing class where you can get away with fluffy prose and skate through the semester. Darcy will push you to think about what you're writing about, and you'll find out more about yourself through the process. Take the class. It's worth it.</comment>This class will increase your awareness of how others read your work, which hopefully results in improved writing (I think for me, it has).</comment>This course is definitely a lot of work, but it helped me with my writing style enormously.</comment>Such a fun course! You can apply so much of what you learn in this course to so many other types of writing, especially in academic writing.</comment>Take a creative writing course at Harvard, and if you can, take one from Darcy. Not only will the quality of your own work (in terms of its style, how you produce it, etc.) exponentially improve, but your editing skills will as well. You'll learn so much about your classmates and what matters to them in a comfortable, safe environment. Darcy is fantastic.</comment></course>HIST 1434: American Public Life in the 20th Century</title>This class is excellent! Professor Flehinger is a great lecturer and presents the material in a very cohesive way.</comment>A fantastic course with fantastic teachers! Prof. Flehinger and Irvin were both amazing. The lectures are engaging and fun; section is informative and never boring. Definitely take this class if you are at all interested in American history- or if you just want an exciting and reasonably easy class!</comment>This class is great for anyone interested in American History. Professor Flehinger is a great lecturer and the course is really well organized with a stellar reading list. It is a good deal of reading, but well worth it. I cannot recommend it strongly enough.</comment>Very good course. Not life-changing, and probably not a TON of information you couldn't get elsewhere... but well-taught and interesting readings. It's a great course to take if you haven't got any other courses you "need" to take this semester, but I wouldn't move mountains to make time for it.</comment>This is an awesome course! There isn't too much reading and Professor Flehinger is great. We basically cover a new decade/movement each week, which means it moves quickly but you never get bored.</comment>This class is awesome- so engaging, participatory, and not a super high stress.</comment>This class is a great, quick overview of the 20th century, interesting mostly because the way the course material is presented thematically. It would be fantastic even for someone who isn't a history concentrator, and most of the coursework is quite digestible. Moreover, Professor Flehinger is a phenomenal lecturer--he brings great energy to the class, and I looked forward to going to lectures.</comment>You will learn so much, and 100%, absolutely walk away with a better understanding of American history, and the relationship between the government and population in our country.</comment>The premise of this class is fascinating, but the quality of the teaching is inconsistent. Lectures can be great or unintelligible,  readings can be illuminating but then ignored in class and section even when they are very applicable or assigned at the last minute with an unclear connection. In terms of the reading and writing, it's not terribly hard and you don't need a ton of history experience. But the disorganization can be very frustrating, so beware.</comment>A great class for freshman of sophomores looking to explore 20th century American history and politics––a gateway to think about other classes/professors with whom to work in future years at Harvard. Brett is a wonderful lecturer and a teacher who is committed to his students doing well––he will take time to meet with you, get to know your strengths/weaknesses, etc.</comment>Brett's a great lecturer, although the class is often more sociological than historical.</comment>Amazing course. Brett is the best lecturer I've had at Harvard, and the material is very interesting.</comment>As someone who loves government and is especially interested in American life during the 20th century, I was excited to take this class. Unfortunately, though Professor Flehinger is an enthusiastic lecturer and teacher, I found the class to be less substantive and organized than most courses I've taken at Harvard. We often didn't receive reading assignments until the day they were due and sections and assignments were canceled on very short notice. Regrettably, by the end of the semester, I felt like I learned more in my high school AP US History class than I did from History 1434.</comment>I can't even describe how amazing this course is. If you have space in your schedule, take it. if you don't have space in your schedule, make space in your schedule, then take it. I'm not a history person, but prof flehinger makes the material SO interesting and engaging, and it makes sense to me in a way that i had never even thought was possible. it also feels so profoundly relevant to your own life -- i never understood why people would concentrate in history before, but after this class & seeing how passionate prof flehinger is about it and how truly he believes in the power of history to help you understand your own world... i'm sold. he also does an incredible job of getting to know his students & making your opinions feel valuable and validated. also teaches you so much material in such a short time. i'm going to miss this class so much -- take it!!! you learn the material, but also about history as a discipline, your own environment as a product of its past... so many different, important, valuable things.</comment>1) This class probably has a high Q score. It did when I took it. I don't know why.
2) This class was an organizational disaster. Pages were readings were sent out late, and often not at all; sections were canceled half the time, etc. Very few people were taking this class seriously by its midpoint.
3) This lack of seriousness should not make you think this class is easy. There's a research paper. You're given no guidance.
4) Lectures start off very strong and quickly become a weird combination of vauge and overly specific. 
5) Please don't take this class.


1) Organization. The lack of organization (especially during the second half of the class) directly hindered everyone's capacity to take the class seriously. Pages for readings were sent out late, then not at all; I went to a total of five sections in my assigned room at my assigned time, etc. Everyone I talked to found this aspect of the class laughable several weeks into the semester. I don't know what exactly butted the seriousness of this problem--maybe it was the small group of dedicated, vocal students who continued to devote a lot of time to thinking about the course--but I would highly, highly recommend making organization a priority in future years.

2) Lectures. Lectures were generally fluid, sometimes interesting, frustratingly pedantic at times. This was a class largely driven by broad themes, themes which were lost in a barrage of weirdly excessive detail during some lectures (Vietnam and McCarthyism come to mind especially). The Socratic method, often ill-suited for lecture settings, frequently became comic: "What do children become?" Adults, right?

3) "Write a 15-page primary source research paper on some aspect of 20th century American history" is a really tough assignment for non-history concentrators (I'm a history concentrator)--I think, largely due to the difficulties associated with actually knowing how to locate and delve into proper primary sources and secondary texts in a relatively short period of time. This is a niche skill, and this class seemed to have lots of non-history concentrators (which is great!) who didn't really know where to start with this. This is more a general problem I have with the History department here than a truly specific complaint about this class--there really just need to be more assignments that a) provide a set of primary sources and b) demand more than a "close reading" (thanks, English!) of them. There's just simply not enough time in the average student's day during the academic year to properly research and treat primary sources.</comment>If you are interested in expanding your knowledge of US History, this course may be for you, though it is certainly not a foundational course in US History. A fair amount of weekly reading and worthwhile lectures.</comment>Brett is a great and enthusiastic teacher, lectures were interesting and the reading was great</comment>This class is a great history class for non-concentrators. Brett is a gifted instructor who teaches not just history, but the historical method extremely well. A fun elective for those looking to get their feet wet!</comment>Bottom line: lecture is phenomenal and beyond engaging, section is very stellar. This has been one of the best history courses I have taken here. It is not without its flaws, but overall stellar.</comment>This course discusses patterns and themes vitally central to our American history and today.</comment>I really enjoyed this course. If you have any interest in 20th century American history, I really recommend it. It helped me view American history from a different perspective, from the point of view of public vs. private, rather than as linear cause and effect relationships. It's well-organized and taught well.</comment>This is an amazing class to take either as a history concentrator or as someone looking for an interesting elective. It may seem like there are a lot of readings but the vast majority of them are incredibly interesting sources. Brett is one of the best teachers at Harvard - beyond being a great lecturer, he actively gets students to participate during class. He's also extremely available outside of class and one of the few professors I've had who makes an effort to make students feel comfortable seeking him out. The class actually played a big role in convincing me to become a history concentrator - if you're interested in modern politics, it provides a really fascinating way to look at the subject that you won't get out of gov classes.</comment>History 1434 was a great course that I highly enjoyed and learned a lot frm. Prof. Flehinger is a great lecturer and really nice person. I was never bored or not paying attention in lecture, even when I was really tired or stressed, because he is very engaging and interesting and is able to involve students in lectures. A lot of the readings are really interesting and not painful to do. Prof. Flehinger was pretty bad this year about giving us the page numbers for readings, so you might have to hound him for those. Also there is a midterm paper and exam a week apart and both a final paper and exam, which sucks but the class is worth it.</comment>I am enthusiastically recommending this course because of its encouragement of intellectualism - thinking for thinking's sake. The captivating reading list in itself is enough reason to take the class. You have Americans from Angela Davis to Ronald Reagan included on the syllabus; the primary sources were rich and engaging to read. Professor Flehinger was a very engaging lecturer, and very funny - one of the best I've seen at Harvard. Flehinger also encouraged us to think critically and fostered a sense of intellectualism that I found valuable.</comment>This is one of the best courses I have taken at Harvard. Lectures were always fantastically engaging and stimulating and provided a lot of information without feeling burdensome. Readings, though long at times, were always interesting and felt irreplaceable in the syllabus. The course gives you a new perspective on twentieth century American history instead of rehashing the same arguments of other history classes. I came away from the course with a better understanding of how politics worked in history, and, as a result, a better understanding of how modern politics and social movements were formed. This is definitely a must-take class.</comment></course>FRSEMR 40l: Free Speech</title>If you have any interest in government or law (which I hope is almost everyone), you should do everything you can to take this course. Great environment to think about First Amendment ideas and controversies.</comment>Definitely take this class!</comment>This class was a wonderful weekly debate on the freedom of speech in different contexts, and perfect for anyone with a passion for constitutional law or government in general.</comment>Best choice you can make Freshman Fall.</comment>Professor Ungar genuinely cares about his class and his student. He is deeply passionate and knowledgable about free speech and encourages the same enthusiasm in his students. Most rewarding class I took. It would be shame to miss out on an incredible course and professor.</comment>Take this class. Professor Ungar is an amazing teacher and a very cool person. The discussions each week are thought provoking and the topics we cover controversial. This is a great way to spend your first semester, but do be sure you are interested in a lot of discussion!</comment>Engaging in the conversation greatly enhances the in-class experience, but listening is also equally as scintillating sometimes. Doing the weekly readings was very manageable and rewarding, and searching for supplementary cases and information is also rewarding.</comment>This is a great Freshman Seminar. Professor Ungar is great and the material is really interesting. The workload is completely manageable and you'll learn a lot about free speech.</comment>Absolutely wonderful class that allows you to think out loud and debate critical and relevant issues with students who are not afraid to challenge you. Helps you develop your position on free speech and helps you gain a much more nuanced understanding of all the issues that surround it.</comment>This class really changes the way one sees and understands the freedom of speech. The class expands the definition of the first amendment, showing it in its true diversity and breadth of influence. Professor Ungar was excellent, extremely dedicated to the class - flying in every week to teach the course - and was always ready to meet with us if we had questions or anything we wanted to talk about. Do the readings, try your best on the essays, and speak up during class! It's a great course to take but you get out what you put in!</comment>Until you study free speech you will take for granted the freedoms we are give. In addition to this you'll see how difficult some free speech issues are to resolve</comment></course>HAA 98br: Methods Tutorial</title>Extremely interesting, deep exploration of key methods of analysis in architectural history. David set the bar high for the calibre of discussion, and was very supportive in helping us generate our own ideas for our final project. Crucial class.</comment>Think about your case study early. Do not get stuck doing all of the research in reading period. Come to the colloquium with real questions about how to make your paper better.</comment>Such a wonderful semester's worth of reading, discussion, and case studies! The preparation for the final paper is very well planned by David and as a result we did not have to write it in a moment of panic. The colloquium was one of the best parts of the class as well!</comment>Be prepared! This is a mandatory course for concentrators, and depending on how well you absorb and understand the material, it'll really make a difference in your career in the concentration. That being said, don't be discouraged when/if you don't understand certain methodologies.</comment>The methods tutorial is one of the best courses I took at Harvard. The workload is dense, but the coures is extremely rewarding. I got introduced to the various discourses and approaches to art history, which was not only interesting but also broadened my perspective and helped me to find my own style. Ruthie is an amazing teacher, and gave very helpful advice along the tutorial.</comment></course>ENGLISH Camr: Advanced Playwriting: Workshop</title>If you engage fully, this class can really help you grow as a writer. It can also help you find community. More than in any other class I've taken at Harvard, I felt in this workshop that I was among my peers, people who value the same things I do and who want to commit their time to the same things I believe in.</comment>Relaxed class where a love for writing is taught more than anything.</comment>An excellent--and reliably fun--workshop for developing as a writer and getting useful feedback!</comment>This is a great workshop. Professor Marks is extremely knowledgable and does a great job of ensuring that everyone participates and has a chance to receive thorough feedback on their work. Also, you get to read a lot of fantastic plays.</comment>If you're interested in devoting a semester to playwriting, take this class! Sam is a smart teacher with a rare gift for appreciating and guiding students with a variety of writing styles and interests. He's not dogmatic, and you won't come away from this class feeling that there's one accepted way to write. He creates a safe, welcoming environment to grow in as a writer.</comment>This class is awesome! It will expose you to many different styles of writing and push you to expand your limits as a writer. Sam is a great teacher and facilitator of discussion.</comment>Fabulous course, an incredibly comfortable and helpful workshopping environment, and Sam's just great in general.</comment></course>COMPSCI 189r: Autonomous Multi-Robot Systems</title>The idea of this course is wonderful, but its strengths are marred significantly by how horrible the robots used in the class are to work with. The course work always became less about implementing solutions for the psets, and more about finding ways to work around the horrible hardware to get the robot to do something along the lines of what you want it to do. I would have reservations about taking this class if I were you, and they still plan on offering the course without getting new ePucks, or different robots.</comment>You'll get tired of the E-pucks, but this class is mostly a lot of fun. I especially enjoyed coming up with hacks to reduce the complexity of the robot's tasks each week. Try to take this class with a friend you know you can work well with.</comment>There are a couple interesting problem sets, but you might not learn as much as you hope about multi-robot systems. 80% of the class hardly mentioned multi-robot systems, and the last 20% only touched on it, but the final project was basically programming a single robot multiple times. Programming the robots was often tedious and frustrating for several reasons (e.g. slow debugging, hardware issues, and your ambition is limited by the memory and computing capability of the hardware). Don't expect to program any super sophisticated algorithms on the robots; it probably won't work, but even if it is possible, you will encounter annoying bugs long before you get to such advanced optimization.</comment>The class offers the opportunity to experience the highs and lows of developing programming for a robotic platform.</comment>The class is really fun in terms of getting robots to do things, but ePucks are kind of terrible. Its a great class if like project-oriented classes with open-ended challenges.</comment>Great intro to robotics. They cover a wide range of topics and you learn a lot. It's also cool to watch your robot in action.

My only reservation is that working on the problem sets can be very frustrating because you spend the majority of your time working on calibration or hardware issues.</comment></course>ENGLISH Crr: Fiction Writing: Workshop</title>Bret is an excellent and engaging professor, and basically treats his students as equals. From day one in the seminar you're given the title "writer;" in his class you're a writer, not a student. This class is just an unbelievably supportive and enjoyable environment no matter how much writing you've done. I really recommend it to everyone.</comment>If you want to develop or improve upon your creative writing skills take this class! Bret is awesome.</comment>Great workshop for those interested in the traditional, straightforward approach to the fundamentals of crafting a short story. Bret creates a very positive and productive environment for workshop and is a wealth of knowledge about the art of fiction. However, expect that most of your time in this class will be devoted to reading and providing feedback for your classmates, and not as much focusing on your own writing.</comment>This class is emphatically worth taking: Bret is cool, our section was engaged and collaborative, and you'll come out of it with something like a finished product. Do be prepared to be self-directed about your writing, though. Aside from your one workshop, final deadline, and a couple of small assignments at the beginning of the course, the task of choosing to write is on you.</comment>AMAZING COURSE! Definitely take this class if you are interested in learning how to write. It is absolutely worth your time</comment>This is one of the absolute best courses I've ever taken. Bret is brilliant, everyone in class was fascinating and insightful, and there was so much respect and good vibes all around. I grew tremendously as a writer and reader and thinker (even just looking at my writing from the summer!) and just benefitted so much from every single workshop class. TAKE THIS CLASS!!!</comment>Bret is the most down to earth guy you will ever meet. His philosophy towards writing is one which you will want to be exposed to. If Bret could become a little bit more "into" this course, meaning take a bit of a more guru role for us as writers, this would prob be the best creative writing course. A little bit more passion and rigor would really make this course something special. Not that it wasnt a special experience - I would by all means recommend it - but it needs a little bit more umph to become truly amazing.</comment>If you're lucky enough to get in, definitely take it. It may be the only class for which I actually did all of the readings because they were so fun. I would procrastinate on work by doing homework for this class- no homework has ever been so enjoyable. My classmates' writing was so impressive, and it was amazing to put down their stories and just think, "Wow." Bret gives concrete strategies for writing, which is very useful, and not something I could just learn on my own without a professional writer-teacher.</comment></course>US-WORLD 39: History of American Democracy</title>After taking this course, I regret ever giving any other courses a 5 for a Q-score. Hands down best class I've taken at Harvard, Professor Moss is the best. If you are deciding between this and the other Business School USW course, take this one.</comment>Fantastic class! You will learn a ton and have fun doing it!</comment>This is hands down the best class I have taken at Harvard. Professor Moss is the best teacher I have ever had. The case study method (both in reading and in class) are a lot of fun and a pleasant break from history classes that drown students with reading. The variety of types of thinkers in the class makes the conversation awesome. Basically, take this class!!</comment>This class is amazing! If you are looking for a class that lets you dive into the heart of political debate and American democratic history, this is THE course. No background necessary. I feel much more well-versed in political discourse to the extent that I can draw historical parallels and much better understand the problems facing our democracy today. Dr. Moss is an amazing professor in both facilitating discussion and lecturing himself, not to mention he's advised some of the big players out there in our country so he's got years of incredibly impressive experience. This course also challenges you to speak up in front of a lot of people. My only complaint is that the class is way too big, and it's very stressful when 40% of the grade is participation and the class has around 80 people in it.</comment>This class was my favorite of the term. Although classes were stressful because I constantly felt pressure to speak (because of the large class participation portion of the final grade), I loved going to every class. Some of my most basic beliefs about government were challenged and I credit Professor Moss and my classmates for expanding my knowledge of democracy.</comment>This a fantastic class, and Professor Moss is a fantastic professor. He moderates the discussions with great poise, summarizing all the relevant points while asking all the tough questions to force individuals and the group as a whole to advance their thinking. It's sometimes tough to get called on due to the fact that there lots of people in the class (80 undergrads, 20 MBAs), but you definitely will get the chance to speak. Absolutely recommend it!</comment>This course is great! Very engaging. The cases that we read are really interesting. And there are only 2 very short papers through out the semester. The only thing to be wary of is that participation is a huge part of the grade, and it sometimes can be hard to participate because there are a lot of people in the class.</comment>Best class ever. Case studies are amazing. The professor manages the discussions incredibly well. Dive into cases, not just go over. Analysis is great. I do my readings ~2 hours before each class, only 2 midterm papers as hw (short), with a final paper that's a bit longer but manageable. Only bad part is so many ppl ~95 means that you'll have to raise your hand a lot and generally only get called on once per discussion (and not for every discussion).</comment>Super interesting class, amazing professor but make sure you really understand the readings in order to participate in class</comment>I absolutely LOVED this class! The case studies were interesting, Professor Moss is incredible, and every class is just a discussion. One of the main things I'm grateful for is that it teaches you the meaning of "becoming a better citizen" and what factors keep democracy alive. In addition, I really enjoyed the fact that the class was offered to undergraduates even though it was taught at HBS. Overall, fantastic USW gen-ed course!!</comment>This class is great. David Moss is wonderful and a great lecturer (funny and engaging). Be ready to speak in class.</comment>David Moss is a boss. That rhymes and is true. Being a citizen is cool and important, and you'll learn a bit about that in this class.</comment>I am a senior and this is the best class I took at Harvard. Just take it! This will sound like such a cliche but I really did think it was the essence of a true liberal arts education - really teaches you how to think about democracy and incorporate it into how you live your lives. I would spend time thinking about these ideas outside of class every week and some of the cases really stayed with me. This was a total elective for me and I am so so happy I took it.</comment>This class is a wonderful way to fulfill the US in the World Gen Ed requirement for undergraduates. The workload isn't too substantial; it's typically a total of 30-40 pages of reading a week, plus 2 short (750-word) papers and a 12- to 15-page final paper. All in all, the class is fairly painless. At the same time, it teaches a lot about about the problems that the US democratic system has had to face and overcome in the last 240 years. Through the class, I learned a lot about what aspects of US democracy are best-equipped to deal with particular political and democratic issues. Prof. Moss is an excellent instructor. It is clear that he is both extremely knowledgeable and very passionate about teaching. The class is mostly based around class participation, and Prof. Moss made sure to solicit a lot of class participation in order to make the course run well.

Overall, this class is absolutely worth taking! I am an applied math concentrator, so this is not the sort of class I would typically take. And yet, I still learned a ton and enjoyed myself in the process, without putting in too much. Take this class!</comment>The class centers on an exciting discussion that is guided and woven together by Professor Moss. Class ends with a conclusion by Professor Moss that makes you think seriously about how problems in the United States should be handled. It's an excellent class to take if you are at all interested in the workings of the democracy.</comment>This course was amazing--it's not too much work, but you learn more than you do in most classes. The case method was also very fun and engaging.</comment>Amazing class! Relatively low workload, really interesting material, cool discussions. And Moss is a brilliant professor.</comment>This was one of my favorite classes at Harvard (I'm a senior)! Incredibly enlightening discussion every class. Every week, you leave with some good questions that you can and should continue to talk about with your friends, roommates, etc. I feel like a more informed citizen after taking this course. As a science concentrator, the workload was totally manageable (one of the few courses where I actually did all of the readings). The one qualm I had with the course is that participation is 40% and given that there were close to 100 students in the course this year, it was often hard to speak up as much as one would like. That's something that will hopefully be addressed in next year's version of the course. Nevertheless, fantastic course!</comment>Best class I have taken at Harvard! I initially was wary because I have no interest in history or politics. But despite being a hard science major, the discussions often made me want to study economics and government deeper. The classes are discussions on case studies, so not really lectures, but rather discussions guided by the professor. It is amazing how engaging he makes the discussions, as they are not simply regurgitating material from the readings.</comment>This class is wonderful. There is a reason why David Moss has won so many teaching awards, and it is because he is great at what he does. He may also be a virtuoso in other areas outside of the classroom, but inside of it he is entirely focused on the students and teaching them. He has a magic touch when it comes to balancing class discussion, covering everyone within the class, getting to show a wide range of ideas and opinions... he will also know everyone's names by week 2, minimum, and really works to get to know his students. He is an absolutely incredible person and teacher. Take it just for him. The case-based classes are also a great way to learn which I loved and found to be both interesting and helpful, but the number one thing is to take it for him. You will walk away feeling so much better informed about American democracy, how it works and how it should, and inspired to change it for the better.</comment>The class itself is quite competitive since so many people want to participate in the lessons. You are supposed to participate in every lecture. Only listening is not enough.

This sometimes distracts you from really listening and leads you to mostly thinking about what your personal statement will be today.</comment>This is without a doubt the best class I've taken at Harvard, and probably the best class I expect to take. Professor Moss is a fantastic lecturer, and really makes you think deeply about democracy in the U.S. Every time I left class I would have conversations with roommates, parents, and others about what I learned. Truly phenomenal experience.</comment>Professor Moss is amazing! When I usually listen to a lecture on these topics, I become bored and unable to follow - it feels like the person talking is not really saying anything of substance (I'm a math concentrator, so that might be a reason I'm experiencing these symptoms). But with David Moss, it's a totally different story - he really made sense, even to me, and made the lectures engaging and interesting. Also - very important - be prepared to speak up.</comment>It takes some work but it's well worth it.</comment>This class is amazing.  Prof Moss is great at directing the discussion, and provides really enlightening conclusions at the end of each class.  The cases we read are all written by Prof Moss and his colleagues, and they are all easy to read without background knowledge.  That being said, don't take the class if you won't bother to do the readings: the entire discussion is based on it, and you won't contribute anything valuable to discussion if you don't.  

Also the two short paper assignments and the final paper are all very painless.  I had a lot of fun even though I haven't written a paper in years.</comment>If USW 39 isn't the best class I've taken at Harvard, it certainly ranks among the top few. I'd especially recommend this class to people who haven't yet taken a course that uses the case method. All the cases are engaging, thought-provoking, and relatively short (approximately 30 pages of reading a week). The discussions in class are fantastic. And Professor Moss is one of the most insightful, thoughtful, and dedicated teachers I've ever had. I cannot recommend this class highly enough. If you are fortunate enough to lottery into it, take this class.</comment>Take this class! It is such an amazing course and Professor Moss is the best facilitator I have ever seen. He puts a whole new spin on American history.</comment>This is a great class, you learn so much. David Moss is one of the best in the business, is engaging, and the teaching staff is top caliber</comment>This class is truly special. There are few classes which are as instructive, thought provoking, and memorable, as this class is. I cannot think of a course in which I learned more. Low workload, high reward - this class is simply amazing.</comment>I am a Senior, and this is the 2nd best class that I've taken at Harvard. Professor Moss is incredible...incredible!!!!! Lectures are engaging. You learn SO MUCH, but the workload is very manageable.</comment>Hands down, the best class I've taken in my life, let alone at Harvard. This provided me an entirely new way to look at democracy and contemporary political issues, and quite literally changed my life. The readings are fascinating yet short, and you're at times brought to tears with how profoundly monumental these seemingly minor political decisions have been. The last lecture, addressing whether democracy is more "broken" now than in the past, is breathtaking. 
Take this class. You'll never find one better.</comment>Take this class. Take it. Now. This is by far the most rewarding course I've taken at Harvard. If you're not used to speaking up in lecture, get ready. The course is incredibly engaging and beautifully catered to come together.</comment>It's a great class. Moss is a great teacher, you will learn a lot. But be careful, the participation grade has a lot of weight. And sometimes the class can be frustrating, and it can be hard to participate. So you will spend lots of time reading a case study, and then not be able to even get any credit for it. But it's part of the process.</comment>This is by far the best Gen Ed I have ever taken. The case studies are extremely interesting, Professor Moss does an amazing job facilitating discussion, and his conclusions and insights at the end of lecture are always really thought-provoking. Every American (and non-American!) citizen should take this class!</comment>This class is absolutely phenomenal. It is one of the best classes I have taken here at Harvard. The professor is amazing, and the way the class is set up is unique. I definitely recommend that everyone take this class. It is especially great for people who want to learn more about the history of democracy and wants to learn in an actively engaging atmosphere. It is extremely important to read every single case study if you do take this class.</comment>Overall, I am pleased that I chose to fulfill my US-World requirement with this class.  That said, I'm not sure I would have taken it if it didn't fulfill a Gen Ed.  This is NOT because this isn't a good course; on the contrary, it is excellent.  But it does draw a particular type of student.  I am not the kind of person who enjoys speaking in large (100+ students) classes.  Like any class as HBS, US-World 39 relies on exhaustive discussion of each case (I often felt as though we were beating a dead horse on some of the issues the cases brought up).  Keep in mind that a considerable proportion of the class is composed of MBA students who have significantly more knowledge and experience on some of the issues covered in the cases (particularly the finance ones, of which there were quite a few though by no means a majority).  Though all of the students in the class were generally courteous (case discussions only got tense a couple of times in the whole semester), I still found the structure a bit intimidating, which is not good considering that participation is a huge component of the final grade.  This also meant that I was not fully aware of where I stood in the course throughout the semester.  Overall, though, the cases and discussions were quite interesting, and Prof. Moss is a great professor.  The optional section workshops were often quite interesting, and you could choose to attend (or not attend) those which you found most relevant.  The workload is very manageable: cases are around 15 pages each, and the two short op-ed style papers during the term can actually be enjoyable to write.  The final research paper (like the other two papers) is very open-ended, which allows you to engage deeply with an issue related to democracy that you find interesting.  If you enjoy class discussions (or if you don't but are looking to go outside of your comfort zone), I would recommend this course.</comment>Really be ready to push your thinking, speak in public, and adapt/react quickly. Moss is a terrific professor, and all the TFs were very helpful in office hours prepping to write the papers. If you're not going to do the reading (not too many pages but did take at least an hour to read), don't take the class. Very important class for being an educated American, learned SO much, got a lot out of it! One of the best I've ever taken.</comment>This is a great opportunity to see what the case study method of learning looks like. Professor Moss is so approachable and a great lecturer, but the majority of the course is really just staying on top of the light reading and contributing in class. Don't be afraid to speak up!</comment>This class is great.  If you are tired of passively listening to lectures, then take Am. Democracy as you are encouraged to be active in the discussion.  The professor writes the materials, and they are often a reasonable length.  The workload is manageable, except the final paper which felt somewhat daunting considering there was no real lead up to it.</comment>you should definitely take this class! The case-based structure of the class was a uniquely effective way to examine american history. The professor is incredible, the emphasis on discussion participation is refreshing and engaging, and the material is fascinating! Couldn't have taken a better class to fulfull the USW gen ed requirement</comment>Come to class with an opinion and be willing to speak up in class. This can be challenging in a room full of 90 students but this class is really the best course at Harvard.</comment>Take this class. Professor Moss is a convincing proponent of a system it's easy to believe is failed. I was genuinely disappointed whenever class ended. Highly participation-based, but not in a bad way--if you're anything like me, you'll want to leap into the fray. Oh, and go to his office hours!--he likes talking with students, it'll give you a chance to shore up your understanding of some broader themes and pose questions if you've got any particular issues (current or historical) you're keen on.</comment>TAKE THIS CLASS

The cases are incredible, the discussion is amazing and professor Moss is a WIZARD. He'll massage just what he wants out of the class discussion, constantly prodding and questioning, really boiling the cases down to essential questions about democracy and government. At the end of every class, I felt a rush of endorphins (or something) because every class was a ticket to a masterfully crafted story that culminated with a remarkable realization about democracy or government.

TAKE THIS CLASS.</comment>INCREDIBLE.</comment>Take this class. It was probably the best history course I will take while at Harvard. Professor Moss is amazing, the course readings are manageable and very interesting, and the class format is awesome. You will learn a ton about lesser known dilemmas in American history and about what makes democracy work.</comment>TAKE THIS CLASS! Professor Moss is incredible and it changed the way I look at much of US History and modern day issues. Absolutely my favorite class this semester, be prepared to do some work and lots of reading but I truly loved it.</comment>One of the best classes on offer, regardless of category. Take it even if you've already fulfilled US-W, but be sure to to participate.</comment>One of the best classes I've ever taken. Professor Moss is a special kind of teacher, and most students remained really engaged. The 1.5 hour classes flew by. The case method is great</comment>Take this class if you like having an opinion. One of the best classes offered.</comment></course>HISTSCI 98: Tutorial - Junior Year</title>Start early, seek your TF's and Professor's advice and support, think about a topic over the summer</comment>great if you're thinking about getting into the history of science</comment>The research process is challenging at first, but if you start with a figure/event/object and identify a relevant archive, you will be able to construct a more coherent narrative about your topic of interest.</comment>It's a lot more work and time than you think it will be and you need to have a topic in mind coming in or you will be at a disadvantage almost immediately. It's basically a two/on and a half semester class in one.</comment>The class structure and the way it breaks up the paper into a semester long effort is really great! Keep up with the deadlines, reach out to the teaching staff if needed (they are very supportive and willing to help), and enjoy this opportunity to create your own piece of original research!</comment>If you are reading this review, it is likely that you have little choice in whether or not to enroll in this course because it is a concentration requirement. Fortunately, the class is well-structured and has a great deal of support available to guide you through what at times can be a tenuous task.  Be sure to conscientiously complete each step of preparation to make the final writing of your Junior Paper less stressful!</comment>If students work hard, they will get a lot out of this class. The more work you put in, the greater the grade, particularly since this assignment is a graded paper.</comment>Be prepared to devote a lot of time on your chosen topic.</comment>It's always a challenge to write a good paper, but the support system and structure of this course make it not only bearable but fun. (It's especially nice to have peers who can commiserate/give you advice.) Archival research is exciting; turning in the final draft has a relieving and satisfying sense of accomplishment. The course teaches fantastic writing and analytical skills, providing you with a solid toolkit to go forth and thesis (if that's your cup of tea) or even just to write better essays in other classes. It may be a required course, but it's one to look forward to.</comment>This course is a lot of work and takes up A LOT of time. Be prepared to work hard. Stay on top of the deadlines and try your hardest not to procrastinate. It is extremely useful and will teach you great skills for inside and outside classroom use. It's pretty awesome because it allows you to explore anything in history of science, technology, and medicine that your interested in. It's super flexible. After this course, you should have a better idea of if you want to thesis or not.</comment>pick a topic before the class begins, it is much more time consuming than 97</comment>This class gets to be somewhat annoying. You spend every section talking about each person's progress, and it is really redundant (especially when you could be using the time to write the paper). The research kickstarter is really annoying and this class is definitely not graded on whether or not you completed things. They take points off if your feedback isn't good enough, for example. That being said, the TFs and Dr. B. are truly awesome, and they are the reason why this course was a valuable experience. Lisa is amazing and will make you a much better researcher and writer.</comment>Junior tutorial has been one of my favorite academic experiences at Harvard! The chance to take an idea you're interested in and run with it has been exciting, empowering, and really really educational. The teaching staff, and in particular, my tf Lisa were endlessly supportive, generating helpful feedback as well as concrete suggestions for areas to improve or expand my paper. It was so exciting to realize an idea, from inception to finished project, and I feel like my understanding of academic papers is much more nuanced and appreciative now! The class really sets you up for success and has gotten me so excited about writing a thesis next year. I also feel like I honed by history of science analytical skills, which is a helpful mark of progress within the concentration.</comment>It's a very well-led tutorial. You'll learn a lot!</comment>Start thinking about topics as early as possible, as having an idea is helpful. However, it often changes, so getting on top of it early is a great idea.</comment>-- Really trains you to write excellent papers which is applicable not just in the history of science but in all courses at Harvard</comment>This course provides the opportunity to delve into a topic entirely of your own choosing within the history of science. I really enjoyed researching an event that few people had heard of or written about. The teaching team offers excellent support; so even though the research paper can seem daunting at first, they ensure that everyone finishes with something they are proud of.</comment></course>HISTSCI 180: Science, Technology, and Society in Modern East Asia</title>Great class to gain an understanding of the major themes of science and technology in East Asia.</comment>Very interesting course.</comment>Not much work very easy.</comment>I took this course as a fifth class and loved it. Interesting subject matter without a lot of work. Professor Kim is also very nice and understanding. Do speak up during class discussions.</comment>if you are remotely interested in East Asia, take it, it's a gem!!</comment>This course is an AMAZING way to learn interesting material in the most laid back and easy fashion imaginable.  There is very little work outside of class, and very little class time... so unlike other courses at Harvard you can actually be interested in the course material and not have to worry about completely random busy work.</comment>This was perhaps the most interesting elective I have taken, I highly recommend it.</comment>I absolutely loved this class! It was not only very interesting and pertinent to current events, but the material was well presented and organized.</comment></course>SOC-STD 98na: The American Ghetto</title>This course was thought-provoking and challenging. Readings each week were consistently fascinating, and gave us a chance to not only learn about ethnography/methods, but also to wrestle with a lot of really weighty issues (poverty, homelessness, drug abuse, eviction). Thankfully, class discussion was engaging and thoughtful, and Matt's perspective and field experience was illuminating. Project is a big time commitment, but don't let that deter you. Highly recommended.</comment>Looked forward to the class every week. Read incredible books - worked on incredible projects. Loved that it kind of operated like a lab..everyone was working on different things and we would all sort of update each other on the status of our projects each week. The experience of pushing yourself to get out there and work on an ethnographic project like this is really invaluable - totally take the class.</comment>This course takes a lot of time, but it is well worth it if you're up for it. Try to come into the course with a concrete research question and field site or contacts/connections to field site already in mind. The readings are fascinating; take the time to read thoroughly.</comment>This class will push you to ask the difficult social questions at the core of the social studies syllabus. But it will do so in a way that cuts past removed academic discourse to a level of intimacy that can be difficult to handle. It's a hugely rewarding experience, but an intellectual, emotional and deeply personal challenge.</comment>Outstanding. Readings are fascinating every week, discussions are smart and engaging, and projects are a valuable experience. Matt's enthusiasm for ethnography and passion for rigorous work around poverty is infections.</comment>This is the best class I've taken at Harvard. I'd describe it as double the work but double the fun, and I'm serious. From a materials standpoint, the readings give you incredible insight into urban poverty in America. Matt will challenge but also encourage you in the development of your research. Do invest the time in your fieldwork; the more hours you log, the more you'll get out of your research. I felt constantly challenged and engaged, but I also felt empowered to do ethnography. Overall, this tutorial was extremely formative in shaping how I want to proceed with my Social Studies thesis and my eventual methodology.</comment></course>ANTHRO 2722: Sonic Ethnography</title>Big time commitment, but very useful technical skills in this class.</comment>Be adventurous in your choice of site as focusing your projects around a rich sonic environment will be a rewarding experience.</comment>to get a chance to explore sonic sense</comment>I recommend this course to ethnomusicologists or musicians BUT NOT to people interested in bridging sound outside of these disciplines. The class is not theory friendly and the intellectual discussions are very poor and anachronistic.</comment>Don't miss this one</comment>This class focuses heavily on sound recording and production. I think it would be most useful for students who have a very clear idea of a sound project they would like to pursue and need a venue for assistance toward that goal.</comment></course>E-PSCI 186: Low Temperature Geochemistry I: Introduction to biogeochemical cycles</title>This course is a fairly basic introduction to ocean geochemistry. You'll gain a broad sense of processes that take place in the ocean and chemical trends. The pace and direction of the course tend to vary abruptly, but Dr. Johnston welcomes questions if you're confused. Be sure to attend section because that's when a lot of the material is covered.</comment>This class is fantastic. Dave and Andy are both wonderful and extremely dedicated. The course material is incredibly interesting. The course is not extremely rigorous and very little background in chemistry or geology is necessary. You'll learn a lot, although there's very little work and it's not at all a stressful experience.</comment>If you need to know things about stable isotopes and how to use them, this is a great class to take.</comment>Does a very good job of covering the basics of biogeochemical cycling (isotopes being simply a tool to understand its dynamics), without exposing students to undue time consumption or stress.</comment></course>SOCIOL 202: Intermediate Quantitative Research Methods</title>Jason and Hope did a terrific job. I felt like I came out of the class with a strong understanding of OLS regression and a good foundation for future coursework.</comment>Great course for the aspiring heavy or moderate quant methods researcher. Especially useful for sociology students hoping to publish in top-tier sociology journals.</comment></course>HIST 1011: The World of the Roman Empire</title>Emma is amazing and this course is definitely worth taking.</comment>Emma Dench is an incredibly entertaining and engaging lecturer. She is like an actress on the stage and every lecture is enjoyable.</comment>This class is not stressful at all and is a lot of fun. Professor Dench is great at generating enthusiasm for the subject matter, so even if you're not the most interested in ancient history you will enjoy it. Readings aren't very taxing, and you can definitely get by without buying the Potter textbook.</comment>This course does a good job at covering a crucial period in the World's history by honing in on key themes. However, be prepared to be bored to tears by some of the readings.</comment>This class teaches you basic history that I'm of the opinion of everyone should know.</comment>Lots of unnecessary readings. Frustratingly tedious assignments. Poorly organized, disjointed lectures.
That being said, the workload is light and Professor Dench is absolutely charming and wonderful</comment>Emma Dench is a fantastic and engaging lecturer and brings the Roman world to life.  However, it was sometimes chaotic because lectures are not concretely chronological so by the end I was pretty confused about the actual timeline.  Readings are also pretty heavy, but section does a really good job of making them applicable to course themes.  The primary sources were awesome, insightful, and so interesting.</comment>There is a lot of reading for this course more than most students will probably read.</comment>It is an interesting class and is well taught. The TFs were very good and it was well organized and interesting. It is a pretty standard good Gen Ed class and if you are interested in Rome I would recommend it.</comment>Really fun class! Emma Dench is awesome!</comment>History 1011 is a excellent course for those who have even the slightest passion for history. Professor Dench is an amazing lecturer. She always engages her students and makes it enjoyable to learn history.</comment>The lectures were boring. My section happened to be good. The topic is interesting but the lectures and readings were not.</comment>Dench is the best lecturer I have had at Harvard.</comment>This is an excellent class to take. Honestly, I learned so much about Roman History and the faculty were great. I had kathryn as a TF and she was seriously amazing. Prof Dench is fantastic as well! She would help you with keyterms or just basic understanding of the material!</comment>Emma Dench is amazing! She is funny, entertaining, and effective, and the class was really a valuable experience. Be sure to take notes during class (the lectures are the most important part, and they are NOT videotaped). This is not a stressful class, but you will learn a lot.</comment>Very fun course, and a great gen ed! Professor Dench is very fun and engaging!</comment>Professor Dench is fantastic; go to lecture! The readings are engaging and will really tie together the things taught in class.</comment>Everyone could draw something from this class. It provides an opportunity to look at different ways that people can rule and be ruled.</comment>Relatively painless</comment>This is essentially a class on Roman foreign (and to a lesser degree domestic) policy, and Roman cultural identity. It does not focus heavily on day to day life, or on the archaeological record. The class strikes a good balance between assigning a sensible amount of reading and still conferring a good deal of knowledge. Section is well run and highly informative.</comment>It's a class that teaches us about where Western Civilization comes from.</comment>Overall a good class. Professor Dench brings a lot of enthusiasm for the material, the assignments are relatively short and easy, and the readings for section are great (though sometimes long).</comment>Lots of readings, but otherwise not much trouble.</comment></comment>Professor Dench's lectures are the best part of this class, so make sure you go.</comment>Dench is great, she's a fun teacher, however the lectures are jumpy and sometimes hard to follow. If you do the reading in advance like she requests it's not problematic. Overall it's a very easy history course and not much is expected of you. You should be willing to do the reading if you're going to take the class or you miss out.</comment>TAKE THIS COURSE! Emma Dench is amazing, lectures are a blast. Readings are absolutely painless if you are fascinated with Roman history. I cannot recommend this course more highly! The one drawback is that I wish it had gone deeper into the Roman military, but other than that it is a great course... Take it!</comment>Prof Dench is very lovely, funny, a clear and careful lecturer. The primary sources were interesting. William was a wonderful TF. The course expectations and structure were very clearly communicated. On the negative side, I understand that the lectures did not intend to give a traditional historical narrative (which we were supposed to learn on our own by reading the readings), but rather to offer insights, different perspectives, and critiques of the traditional narrative. However, the textbook and the secondary sources were rather long, dense, tedious, often tangential, and difficult to keep up with. I ended up feeling like I didn't have enough of a grasp on the traditional narrative to appreciate what was going on.</comment>Professor Dench is a very nice person and an engaging lecturer, but attending her lectures aren't really necessary to succeed in the course. As a result, the majority of the coursework involves teaching yourself key terms and reading primary and secondary sources. The material from lecture doesn't show up on the midterm/final and doesn't help in writing papers.</comment>I approached this class as a manageable history course so that I could see if history would be a concentration. This was a mistake, because the Classics Department is in charge of this course and the course is more representative of a GenEd than a typical history course. I enjoyed the course, but I  don't believe it's what someone who is passionate about Rome desires.</comment></comment>Good reading list but I was never all that enthusiastic about the class--it's big and was too much of a broad introduction to Roman history that resulted in quickly moving from unit to unit.</comment>This course covers fascinating material and is amazingly taught. It really takes apart what we think we all know about Rome and forces you to think critically about Rome and its legacy. I really appreciated the focus on minority perspectives, which I think a lot of history courses tend to ignore. The only thing greater than the material we covered was the teaching staff: Emma Dench is an amazingly engaging lecturer, and my TF Lizzie was one of the best I've ever had. 10/10, would recommend.</comment>You will get a lot out of it if you put time into it.</comment>Emma Dench is a very enthusiastic lecturer, but the tendency of the course to bounce around instead of progress chronological is a bit frustrating.</comment>It's a good class, but although professor Dench is interesting the material is not that cool.</comment>This is a great choice for a gen ed.  I tend to fall asleep during/skip gen ed lectures, but this was a good exception.  Prof. Dench is very engaging, and if you get Lizzie as your section leader, then you're even luckier.</comment>The lectures are really entertaining; Prof Dench is super engaging and great. You learn about the bits of history which get left out of the dominant narrative, which is awesome. There's some pretty dense readings, but all of the assessments are easy; they definitely know it's a Gen Ed, and structure it accordingly. Definitely a great course!</comment>Prof. Dench doesn't lecture, she performs. She's amazing. Take this course.</comment>If this course is available (I know Professor Dench may not be teaching it in 2015) TAKE IT if you have any interest at all in the Roman Empire. If you need to fulfill SW, but don't like History, STILL TAKE IT, because this is by far the most engaging class you could take! And it isn't unmanageable - you know what's expected of you so it's pretty straightforward to do well.</comment>It was a well taught class that is good for anyone interested in the Roman Empire.</comment>Emma Dench is a great lecturer, but the course is poorly structured - i.e lectures do not proceed in chronological order and do not tie together into a larger theme.</comment>Go to lecture. Key terms are defined in lecture.</comment>Be prepared to read a lot. But there isn't much work beyond that.</comment>Good class to take if you are at all interested about the broader context of Rome's history. Very little coursework beyond the readings; the textbook is dry but the section readings are fine. It's enjoyable and not much of a challenge.</comment>Great class. Not too much work, but overall interesting. Papers are graded somewhat difficultly, so make sure to talk to TFs. Exams are not bad, and are easy to crush. Overall, I highly recommend this course.</comment>Interesting, not life-changing- a good course on an interesting subject</comment>Most benefits come from the reading material. Lots of examples in lecture.</comment>It is a lot of reading.</comment>Emma Dench is a very entertaining lecturer who truly wants to interact with her students; she was accessible even outside her own office hours.</comment>If you would like to take a course that builds on your prior knowledge of Rome steer clear of this introductory class. For people with little prior knowledge of Rome, you will find this course an interesting course that at the same time fulfills a gen ed requirement.  Professor Dench is humorous and informative.  While the structure of this course is rather restrictive, the penalty for missing section is a 500 word assignment, the time commitment is minimal and many of the readings can be skimmed.</comment>Not the introduction to Roman history you think it will be. It is a purely thematic course focused on culture above all else. You will come away knowing far more than you would ever have dreamed about dual identities, microworlds, and indirect Romanization, but very little actual, solid history. Having completed this course quite successfully, I probably could not tell you more than 10 or so important dates in all of Roman history. Nor could I give you more than the most cursory summary of that history or the major figures in it. The course isn't necessarily terrible (though the lectures really do jump around more than they should) but it isn't about the history of Rome, it's about the history of Roman cultural development.</comment>The lectures are not that organized... It's best to know something about Roman history before enrolling in this</comment>great class, prof dench is awesome</comment>Take notes and write down the key terms early.</comment>Emma is absolutely wonderful, and her lectures are very entertaining and informative. Jamie is the most wonderful TF I have ever had. He brought us cookies, candy, and was very helpful and caring outside of class. Try to get him as your TF if you can.</comment>The course title is very accurate. Don't expect to come out of the class with a great knowledge of what each emperor did. Do expect to come out with a sense of how religion, or gender, or class was viewed in the world of the roman empire. The only more accurate title would be "Coins of the Roman Empire." You look at SO MANY COINS.</comment>The material is very interesting! I was very skeptical about doing a course in Ancient History but this really demolished all the stereotypes. Prof. Dench is an absolute boss and is one of the most engaging lecturers I have had at Harvard. Take this course if you enjoyed Game of Thrones (a lot of the narrative is similar!!) and want to better understand present day institutions!</comment>IT'S AWESOME</comment>If you're not all that interested in Roman history, you may not like this course. Professor Dench is a funny and dynamic lecturer, but I found myself uninterested in the course material.</comment>Dench brings a lot of enthusiasm. Good for a gen ed if you just want to do something that involves Rome. Bad as far as actually learning the minutiae of Roman history goes--it's really focused on the broad themes of history and discussion, but not the more interesting detail kind of things--but you'll get an easy A without ever even needing to go to lecture, which is pretty good considering this isn't even one of those classes where the lectures are recorded.</comment>Emma Dench is the best professor at Harvard right now.  Take every class that you possibly can with her.  She takes interesting material and makes it truly fantastic!  History 1011 provides a great entry point to learning about Ancient Rome.  You do not need prior knowledge or experience with the subject to be successful.  That said, people who are pre-disposed to be interesting in Rome will have the most fun in this class.  The workload is very reasonable--certainly on the lighter end as far as Gen Eds go, so considering all of this, again most especially Professor Dench, I cannot recommend this class highly enough!</comment>Lots of readings, pretty easy though, largely unhelpful lectures</comment>Take this class! Prof. Dench is also an amazing and engaging lecturer. If you're intimidated by a history class, I think this would be a great class since they don't really focus on memorizing dates etc. It really gives you a comprehensive history on Rome. I really enjoyed this class as a science concentrator and I think it'd be great for anyone fulfilling the gen. ed. requirement or for anyone who is interesting in taking this class as an elective. Also, if you take this course go to the lectures because I think those were most helpful to me and one of the best components of this course. I thought the workload was very fair (2 short-ish papers, a midterm and a final).</comment>A pretty good class overall and a very easy way to satisfy SW, but the class is frustrating all over the place. It can be difficult to stay motivated when you feel like you're not really getting anything out of the class.</comment>Not a cakewalk, but a relatively painless way to fulfill a gen-ed. Two exams, two papers, and participation in section is all that's asked of you. If you have any prior knowledge of Rome, you can get away with skimming some of the readings for section, but even if you don't, don't feel like you'll be overwhelmed by the content. Wasn't the biggest fan of Professor Dench (great person, but you'll feel like a high schooler being lectured again), but that's not a large enough reservation for me to not recommend taking the course. Still worth it for a gen-ed.</comment>This class and Prof Dench are incredible!!! Also when choosing sections, try to get into Lizzie's section; she's super helpful and really understands the material and how to present it.</comment>This course covers a broad sweep of Roman Imperial history and focuses on many diverse subjects: women, Christians, slaves, etc. In this way, the course is helpful in reinventing many of the stereotypes of Rome. The Teaching Fellows and the Professor are all very kind and willing to help.</comment>This class is a wonderful way to learn a lot without much stress. Professor Dench's lectures are hilarious and entertaining, and the section readings really aren't too bad. Sometimes things can be a little bit disjointed (don't bother to buy the textbook), but if you put in some effort you will learn a lot!</comment>Take this class! Everyone should take a course from Dench at some point. She is hilarious and is very engaging in her lectures. This course is a painless way to fulfill society's of the world. Not that much work and if you make a small study group to review the IDs and readings you will do well</comment>It's awesome. A bit more work than I was expecting, but totally worth it.</comment>Emma Dench is wonderful. The class itself is a little slow, but it is enjoyable because Prof. Dench makes every lecture fun.</comment>Multi-faceted.</comment>Professor Dench is awesome and this course had one of the most effective sections I have ever had</comment>This class was great. Professor Dench generated a lot of enthusiasm for the material and was a fantastic lecturer (though her style may not be for everyone). The reading material can be dry at times, but engrossing at others. If you have a great TF like William, the class will definitely be a great part of your semester.</comment>This is a fantastic introduction to Roman history. Prof. Dench is an excellent lecturer and a really nice and fun person. In addition, the readings are very interesting</comment>Professor Dench knows a lot, but can be a little over the top. It might be because it's an intro class, but I sometimes felt that we made things a little too black and white. The material is interesting, but can seem disjointed and scattered. Midterm, papers, and final are all manageable and straight forward. Not an amazing amazing class, but Professor Dench is worth it.</comment></course>MODGRK B: Intermediate Modern Greek: Language and Civilization</title>The Modern Greek B course is a great course to help continue learning the Greek language. Practicing the Greek language on a more advance level with advance</comment></course>JAPAN 106a: Classical Japanese</title>Being introduced to Classical Japanese through direct and immediate engagement with the original materials is thrilling, and to be taught by one of the luminaries of the field all the more so.</comment></course>COMPLIT 249: Cartography and Early Modern Literature</title>Brilliantly creative approach to Renaissance and early modern literature. One of the few cartographic courses available.</comment>It's a very good course that can give you a lot of information on many literary texts from a very original perspective.</comment></course>ETH-REASON 33: Medical Ethics and History</title>Awesome class. Really makes you think about ethics is a relate able and practical way.</comment>This class is a great way to educate yourself on medical ethics. Though we are not told directly what is ethical or not, we are presented with the appropriate information to make arguments for an ethical dilemma that has either been a concern of the past or continues to be one.</comment>It is definitely worth taking, even if you are not pre-med.</comment>This class is a great GenEd. It wasn't too hard, and I learned a lot of interesting material. Sometimes it wasn't the most fun, but I definitely learned a lot and am happy I took the class.</comment>I would tell students that Professor Jones is very knowledgeable about the topics, and the class covers such a wide range that students are bound to be very interested in at least one of the topics. I would also tell them to do all the readings because Professor Jones chooses fascinating/relevant texts to supplement what he goes over in lecture.</comment>Great class! Medical ethics is actually a really cool topic and Professor Jones is a good lecturer. Definitely one of the best ways to fill your ethical reasoning requirement or even great if you are taking the class as an elective.</comment>Easily the best class I've taken in my 4 years here. Prof Jones is a great lecturer, amazing at office hours, and very invested in students. The topics are varied and cover a huge area in healthcare, making us think about the obvious topics like euthanasia and abortion, but then less obviously ethically-charged topics like blame in healthcare, or rationing, etc</comment>This class is so interesting and so relevant. It makes you stop and think about big issues and why you believe what you believe. Professor Jones does a great job of presenting both sides of every arguement equally, which is so nice. The work load is low. I would highly recumbent this class, especially for the ethical reasoning gen ed requirement.</comment>If you are at all interested in medicine or health care policy, you have to take this class.</comment>This is my favorite class I have taken at Harvard. Dr. Jones is an amazing lecturer and the course material is extremely interesting and very manageable. I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of this course.</comment>I think this course was excellent! Although there were very many readings, they were relevant to each lecture and gave good historical overviews, memorable narratives, and interesting philosophical arguments. Additionally, the professor's lectures were compelling, well-organized, and tied in the readings smoothly. Because each lecture was clear in its key points and the information provided on the slides covered the philosophical arguments and outlined the historical trajectory of each issue, I felt prepared going into each section discussion. 

Advice: do the readings- this is one of the courses in which they are essential. It's important to start the essays early because arguments based on philosophy and history require a lot of research in advance as well a lot of time to think about what you've researched. Take this class because the professor is extremely compelling and has many stories to tell.</comment>It's really interesting and relevant. If you're interested in medicine or health, this is a great class that gives you the tools to look at medical dilemmas from all different aspects.</comment>it's a good ER for science people or those afraid of ER.  You should probably take notes in lecture (and go) because the slides have very little info on them.  Very fair midterm and final, the papers aren't too bad if you start early.  Huge range in TFs so get a good one</comment>Take this course. Lecture's are awesome!</comment>One of your best options for Ethical Reasoning. Just remember that you have to like doing historical analysis as well!</comment>fantastic class, should absolutely take if you have any interest in the medical field</comment>Take this class! Prof. Jones is an absolutely amazing lecturer and thinker, and this class is accessible and applicable to absolutely everyone. It will make you think about health care, and your role in the health care system (regardless of whether or not you will be working in these fields - because we are all a part of it in one way or another, honestly) in a really different way. The best way to fulfill an ER - it's everything the Gen Ed program says it should do.</comment>This is an incredible course. Very good professor with a fascinating section. Incredibly educational and engaging, inspiring. The professor was INCREDIBLE in tying up the course, being clear, and motivating his students. Definitely take it.</comment>I'm really glad I decided to choose this class over the other infamously easy ER class (ER18). As someone who wants to go into medicine, this class really teaches you to approach certain medical issues with a much more informed and careful perspective. There are questions of morality and rightness that I never would have considered before taking this class. I highly recommend it - it's a great way to make you think in a way you would never think before.</comment>Great course and you learn a lot.</comment>This is wonderful course. Professor Jones is a phenominal.</comment>The class is great. You will learn how to form arguments and defend your positions. You will also learn a lot about the medical problems and the arguments that have been made to resolve them.</comment>DO NOT take this course unless you have some background in medical ethics. The paper assignments are super vague and graded harshly. The midterm was very fair though and the topics are relevant to current events and thus very interesting. Professor Jones gives decent lectures but is way too serious</comment>I highly recommend taking this course. It's an excellent introduction to ethics and philosophy. The topics are truly fascinating, and Professor Jones is an exceptional lecturer.</comment>This is a great gen-ed but just a warning David Jones does not know his audience. This isn't a bunch of juniors in history of science that know how to write papers and self-selected into this class because they are passionate about history and ethics. This is a group of students trying to fulfill one of Harvard's crappiest gen-ed requirements (in terms of interesting options). A good percentage of the class is freshmen and another good chunk is comprised of people that think this sounded like the least painful option. David Jones needs to provide supplementary notes with his lectures or more text. THERE IS NOTHING TO STUDY FROM but you can do OK just based on the readings. He goes way too fast in lecture to write it all down so if you are someone that is looking for a class with clear expectations of what you need to know this isn't it. That being said, I actually liked the class and it is likely by far one of the least painful ways to fulfill ethical reasoning. The topics were super interesting, David Jones is a great lecturer, and I feel like I learned how to think about medical ethics that will shape the way I think about some of these topics for the rest of my life. The two essays were straightforward and graded fairly. The midterm was straightforward to. I think the course gets a lot less organized during the second half of the course. Like I studied really hard for the final given what was available and a lot of it caught me off guard. Hopefully David Jones can be more transparent about what topics will be on it. The class didn't prepare me to write those essays on the spot but I'm sure they'll curve it since everyone struggled. In fact, I'm not sure how assigning one essay can all of a sudden make someone capable of constructing how and why something changed when they are reading it for the first time. Overall I'd say take this class. If you try you will get a good grade while learning a lot in the process. It's pretty chill if you are also looking to chill and just fulfill the ER requirement.</comment>This class is a great way to explore ethical dilemmas that are present in the world. It will challenge your thinking and expose you to many different approaches and opinions of very important and sometimes emotional ideas.</comment>I enjoyed this class very much. The information is fascinating, especially if you are at all interested in medicine or ethics. This was perhaps my favorite class of the semester. It's not that difficult and the readings are very interesting. Lecture attendance isn't necessary, which is nice if you can't go (I stopped going after a while because, well, other classes needed me...) 
Overall, take this class. Professor Jones is awesome and you really learn a lot.</comment>if you skim the readings and go to lecture, you'll be fine. low-key class</comment>The material presented in this course is genuinely very interesting. The lectures are engaging and useful, but the section component was barely helpful. This said, it is a good option for the ER requirement.</comment>Great class</comment>It's an okay class. The material is interesting and the workload is very manageable.</comment>The topics covered are interesting but Professor Jones definitely seems to have bias towards certain ones. The exam was fair.</comment>This course is very relaxed and extremely freshman-friendly while at the same time very interesting. As far as learning goes, you can sort of get away with not doing the readings and skipping lecture often and still get by, but it's really worth your while to engage in the class. The content is genuinely interesting and relevant to today's society.It was the kind of relaxed class I didn't stress/worry about (2 papers, a mid-term and a final, and light weekly reading), but still got a lot out of.</comment>Great course to better understand ethical dilemmas in medicine.</comment>The material and lectures are amazing and thought-provoking. The grading portion brings the class down. Be prepared to ask a lot of questions about your TFs requirements and expectations.</comment>This is a great gen-ed. Very interesting, and pretty easy as well. The lectures were great, as were the readings, and I actually enjoyed writing the papers. The only disappointment were the sections- the discussions were usually pretty elementary and it was clear that most people didn't do the readings.</comment>ER 33 was by far one of my favorite courses. I think Professor Jones is an excellent lecturer and covers a wide range of topics. This course really makes you think about your stance on several issues and strengthens your ability to develop an argument. This course discusses subjects that are relevant to any concerned citizen and does so through a historical context. Additionally, the readings in this course are manageable and very interesting. Overall, I would say this course would be a great way to balance your schedule without sacrificing relevancy. I feel at times students will take a course in any subject as long as it's easy, but there are courses like ER 33 where you can be engaged, not overwhelmed by the workload, and you can walk away feeling like you actually learned something that you will benefit from later in life.</comment>If you want to hear Prof Jones ask a series a questions for an entire hour, this class is for you.</comment>This class is wonderful! The topics are really interesting, the readings are definitely manageable, the teaching staff is really helpful for preparing for essays and exams. Definitely a fun, easy way to fulfill the ER gen ed.</comment>This is literally the best course you'll ever take. And I'm not a huge nerd who loves school. Take it.</comment>SUCH AN EXCELLENT CLASS! One of the best ways to fill ER for sure. I was engaged throughout every lecture and looked forward to section and learned so much about the relationship between history, ethics, and medicine. As a Hist and Lit student, I find ethical / philosophical text without context to be really frustratingly difficult to care about. Reading these theories in the context of history and medical dilemmas made them interesting, and helped me reexamine ALL of my opinions.</comment>The materials covered are great. I don't know any science or medical terms, and I'm not a pre-med, but I just really enjoyed thinking a lot about ethics.</comment>Extremely interesting. They require a ridiculous amount of participation. Definitely one of the more interesting classes I have ever taken here.</comment>This course was really interesting and the assignments were actually fun to do. This was the perfect way to satisfy Ethical Reasoning.</comment>This class is well lectured but sectioned poorly. Additionally, there is very little connection between the material and the modern day world. Think about that when choosing this course.</comment>This class caused me to think about many issues on a deeper level than I have before. Although it is unlikely to change anyone's mind on issues, I was able to see the other side on a lot of issues that I have not been able to see before.</comment>This class is fascinating and rewarding. It is very informative and pushes students to consider their opinions from many perspectives. It challenges students in their thinking, and offers real life ethical reasoning. I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in the field of medicine. Even if students aren't inclined to pursue medicine, the ethical questions raised in this class are universal and relevant.</comment>It is a great Gen Ed!</comment>This is literally by and far the easiest class I have ever taken at Harvard. It's so easy that the class actually gets quite boring sometimes (probably because it seems to be designed for science concentrators who can't even write a coherent essay). The material in and of itself is interesting, but I feel as though it could be framed/presented in a much more complex and challenging fashion.</comment>The course covered a wide variety of subjects, approaching them from many angles which allowed students to engage on a historical, medical, and philosophical level. The subject matter stayed interesting, as it differed from week to week, and brought forth many issues that are apparent in daily life.</comment>What you get out of this class depends on how much effort you put into it. You don't have to do all the readings to do well, but you'll be surprised how much you'll learn from devoting just a few hours a week. This may be a gened, but if you're premed you'll surely encounter the ethical dilemmas presented in this course in the future. This was probably my favorite course of the semester for this reason. Aside from readings, workload was 2 papers (one 5 p and one 9 p), midterm, & final.</comment>It is a wonderful class! It is extremely interesting and engaging. The paper assignments allow you a lot of flexibility and office hours are very helpful if you are having any trouble.</comment>It's an okay gen-ed but there are more enjoyable ways to fill the ER requirement. Only take this class if you really are interested in Public Health issues or about the ethical issues a doctor will run into. If you're not super stoked about these subjects you won't really like the class.</comment>Painless gen ed with pretty easy essays. Huge discrepancy in TF grading though.</comment>This class is amazing! If you are pre-med definitely take it. It will help you as a future doctor and more short term with MMI interviews.</comment>It's a good intro, but too broad. Perhaps too easy to be a challenging/satisfying course.</comment>This course was one of the most interesting courses I have ever taken at Harvard! Professor Jones is an incredible lecturer. This class makes you think of complex medical ethical dilemmas from a different perspective and makes you truly understand the issues at hand. Some interesting areas we discussed was a legalization for marijuana, abortion, and ethical research. I recommend that everyone take this class!</comment>This is a fabulous class.</comment>This course is a great way to fulfill your ethical reasoning requirement! The material is very relevant to real-world issues.</comment>This course will push you to think about things in a completely new way. You will continuously be linking the material to what you experience and come across in the news every day and will probably find your perspectives changing and clarifying throughout the term. This is good!</comment>Professor Jones is a highly skilled lecturer. Of all the lecture classes I've taken at Harvard in my four years, I think this one had the highest attendance rate, and I'm not surprised. The ethical questions are all thought-provoking and there is very little brute memorization needed. This class will at the very least help you to understand some of the arguments for and against almost any ethical dilemma in medicine you can think of. I highly recommend it!</comment>Professor Jones was very engaging. He also responded well to students who questioned some of the notions he presented in class. He was very good about saying when he was being objective versus giving his own opinion based on his own medical experience.</comment>I highly recommend this class as a way to fill ER! Professor Jones is a great lecturer and makes lectures fun and engaging, and I thought the material was always interesting. It was easy for me to see how applicable and useful the material was to everyday life, which was very nice to realize as I was going through the course. The class is not too challenging and the work is certainly manageable. I am very happy I took this course!</comment>This was a great course. Except for the tedious and probably pedagogically ineffective final exam, the coursework was very effective at developing skills, and I really appreciated that. I felt that I deepened my understanding of ethics, and learned about it in a context that was very interesting and relevant given the various public health situations in the news (Ebola, obesity, etc.).</comment>I would not recommend this course because the readings feel like busy work, the papers are graded too harshly and the midterm is not graded fairly. I think the lecture topics were interesting, but I do not think the class was fun and I strongly disliked attending section.</comment>DO NOT FALL BEHIND ON READINGS. They're actually pretty interesting anyway</comment>Very interesting class that makes you think very differently if you're a science student.</comment>This is a great way to fulfill your ER requirement, especially if you're interested in medicine or health at all! The two papers, midterm, and final are all pretty painless, and the class definitely provokes some interesting thinking. Austin is the best TF and is so, so helpful, and the course itself is well-organized.</comment>This class perfectly finds that balance between understanding that it's a Gen Ed where not everyone has the same background and not talking down to anyone in the class. Section was fantastic and lecture was always fun and informative.</comment>A great class -- the papers were a bit harder than I anticipated.</comment>Great professor, great teaching staff, interesting assignments.</comment>This course is an engaging introduction to many major debates in our society. It is truly relevant whether or not you have any interest in medicine. It provides great thinking questions and a useful framework in which to consider them. The readings are varied and interesting and the assignments can be tailored to your particular interests. However, for those with any experience in philosophy, this is definitely an introductory course that does not delve very deep into these arguments. It is almost exclusively focused on the U.S.</comment>It's a tough class, but I would recommend it. There is a lot of reading, but it develops your critical thinking skills substantially.</comment>Great way to get through ER requirement</comment>This is a good course that allows students to learn about various ethical dilemmas in medicine and how they relate to other areas of interest.</comment>A wonderful way to learn about philosophical and historical approaches to very old and new medical dilemmas. The class presents a great toolkit to situate yourself in ethical choices.</comment>This class does a wonderful job of being an engaging ER, with assignments you can direct to your own interests, and outlining analytical skills I wish I'd had much earlier in my college career. I will say that it seemed TF's varied greatly, I loved mine but others had much stricter sections. It definitely changes people's experience of the course. It's in my top 4 classes taken at Harvard though, and perhaps the most directly applicable course I've taken--and is fairly easy if you pay attention. Readings were fascinating, and not too much, and assignments were doable and approachable.</comment>Would definitely warn about the final. I absolutely loved this class, but the final kind of ruined for me.</comment>I really enjoyed this class. It's probably one of the easiest and most engaging ways to fill your ER requirement.  Medical ethics is very relevant in this day and age, especially this year with health care debates and the ebola epidemic.  It's a great way to start thinking about the ethics behind many aspects of health care. Professor Jones is very knowledgable, and the sections were spent debating instead of sitting idly.  The assignments and exams seem to be easier than they were the first year.</comment>This is a class that you really get what you put into it. If you read carefully and are prepared for section, you will likely learn a lot. Don't let yourself get behind on the readings. For a gen-ed it's pretty good.</comment>Please don't let this be the course you flake out on...</comment>This class covers many controversial topics. Professor Jones is good at presenting many sides to the topics and asking questions that make you question what you thought you believed. If you're premed, it's a great class to get you thinking. If you just want to know about issues in the world, it's a great class for that too!</comment>Really thought-provoking class and not too much work.  Doing all the readings is probably not necessary and may not translate directly onto any assignments, but it is worth it to do the reading if you can.  It is very interesting and there are a variety of genres of readings (journal articles, editorials etc.)While writing this, I have not yet taken the final, but my one concern is whether the class has actually prepared us for the the final (short answers and two essays)</comment>a wonderful class; Prof. Jones is amazing and teaches extremely effectively; learned a lot; feel more prepared for med school</comment>Great lectures, interesting readings and amazing debates in section</comment>I was dreading the ethical reasoning requirement, but this course completely changed my opinion. It was a fantastic introduction to some of the toughest dilemmas in medicine that certainly changed the way I think about doctors, medicine, and even just right and wrong. Professor Jones enhanced the already interesting material through well-tailored lectures and readings.</comment>Doing the readings will make the class more rewarding and you'll be more prepared for the exams.  This is a good class to take to really get some background in the problems that have and still plague the medical system today.</comment>best way to fulfill ER</comment>You will learn a lot of important things about medical ethics and make you a more informed consumer of news.</comment>This was a pretty interesting course that wasn't too difficult. The course goes for breath over depth and is pretty explicit about that, so I'd keep that in mind if you're looking for a course about advanced arguments in bioethics. The course brings in a pretty wide range of students (and a lot of premeds) so I'd also keep that in mind. Overall, the coursework and assignments require some effort before you actually start the paper (you probably won't do that well on papers if you wait until the day/night before they are due) but the course staff is incredibly supportive in that regard. As someone who is HistSci and has some basic exposure to philosophy, there were weeks where I felt like I didn't learn a lot that was really new to me, but that comes with the course. Overall, not a bad way to complete the ER gen ed, even if you aren't premed/interested in medicine or healthcare.</comment>This class is really great. Prof Jones is enthusiastic but honest and down to earth in his teaching. I appreciated his wit and the case studies that he presented. You could tell that he was engaged with the subject, which definitely created a good attitude in class. Office hours (with TF and Prof, too) were always helpful. I had taken a previous medical ethics-related seminar, so I thought this was decently easy, but either way its a good gen-ed-level commitment.</comment>This is an amazing course. Professor Jones is a great lecturer, and every single topic you cover is interesting. Even if you think you already know a lot about a topic (like abortion) you always come out of class having thought about the ideas in new ways and learning cool historical stuff also. The course is really well organized, the grading is transparent (and not terribly difficult), and the readings are so good that you will actually want to do them. I looked forward to lecture and wish I could keep taking this class next semester!</comment>This is an easy and straightforward gen ed.  Take the class.  You don't need any background information, it covers mostly topics that are still being debated.  Gets a little repetitive at times but Professor Jones keeps it interesting. Both papers are really easy, you get to write about whatever you want with no real guidelines.  Section discusses are interesting even if you're not much of a participator.  Try to get Carson as your TF, he's the bomb (and super cute).</comment>Amazing class, certainly one of the best ways to fulfill the ER requirement. There will likely be a lot of pre-meds in the class, but that should not deter you from taking it. Do the readings, you will get a lot out of them.</comment>This class was extremely interesting. I was absolutely dreading the ER requirement, but this was actually a class I ended up enjoying a lot- I looked forward to going to lecture and section each week. Would recommend.</comment>If you are at all interested in medicine or even just being a more informed citizen, this is a fabulous class and I highly recommend it! If you are looking for a rigorous treatment of philosophy, this might not be the class for you, and the same goes if you are hoping to read some foundational texts of philosophy. This is a really student friendly course with only two papers and a final exam, so it isn't difficult to keep up. Often times it is possible to keep up in section without having read every page since it's not really just about regurgitating from the text but engaging in critical thinking of your own.</comment>If you are really interested in thinking in a new way about everyday medical dilemmas, I highly recommend this course for not only pre-med students, but every student.</comment>The class is incredibly easy and low workload. The readings are pretty much unnecessary and section is completely unrelated to lecture. The lectures are not nearly as thought-provoking as the professor believes them to be.</comment>The course material is very interesting! Prof. Jones is a good lecturer, although there will be times when you leave the lecture hall wondering what you were supposed to get out lecture that day. Nevertheless, he will make you think and bring up important arguments about various ethical issues in medicine. The readings are manageable (and not even necessary sometimes, although a lot are interesting). I hate writing but the essay assignments were manageable as well.</comment>GREAT class. Loved the topic and the professor, it does not get better than this for a ER class. However, it is a lot of reading and the final was kind of long</comment>I really enjoyed this class a lot and would definitely recommend it. Dr. Jones was a great lecturer and very accessible, but my tf really brought down this class for me. The paper topics were interesting and I put a lot of work into them, but my tf gave little to no comments with rather subjective grading.</comment>Not really about present-day medical ethics so much as it was about the historical background of many ethical debates present in medicine today. I had been hoping for a bit more of a social justice-y approach to things, so I was a bit disappointed that the class was lacking in this area. Readings are long (and not the most interesting ever) but you should still do them or else the class is pretty much worthless. Exams are hard, papers were great because the prompts give you a lot of feedback and TFs are really willing to help with the brainstorming and researching process.</comment>This is a good class that will give you a stronger foundation to tackle ethical dilemmas in medicine.</comment>This is a fantastic course.  Great lectures, well structured, and very organized with clear expectations.  Lectures by Prof Jones are approached from a practical, real-world perspective which is refreshing for the Gen Ed world.  This has been by far the most useful and fulfilling Gen Ed class that I have taken in my 4 years at Harvard.</comment>Be careful about the range of students taking this calss, some are entry level many are premed, which is hard to learn with.</comment>Take this class! If you want to be able to take on weighty, relevant ethical issues with logic and know-how, this is the class for you.</comment>You can survive without the readings. But you need to know a basic understanding of them for the midterm and final, and they come in handy on the papers.</comment>Be prepared to read a lottt.</comment>Great class and very important information for pre-meds; Professor Jones is a great lecturer. Would highly recommend!</comment>I really loved this course. The lectures were gripping, the paper assignments were unique and stimulating, and section was great. I did not, however, like the midterm, as the questions seemed random and the grading seemed harsh. I am now sitting here ambivalent about the final and how well it tested my knowledge of the course material. It is honestly hard to give a full evaluation without knowing how the subjective nature of the final will be handled, but overall I would recommend the course because that is a problem you will encounter across many courses.</comment>Really interesting class, not that demanding.</comment>Professor Jones's lectures will push you to think more deeply about ethical dilemmas in the medical field and will teach you how to apply philosophical tools around ethics to topics in medicine.</comment>This was a really great class. It really was not that much work and the papers were interesting to write. The midterm and the final seemed daunting at first but were actually really doable. Professor Jones is a great lecturer and the course material is super interesting too. I really liked the class but I probably wouldn't classify it as a gem because there was a decent amount of work.</comment>This class was very interesting however exams and assignments were lengthy.  I think this is probably one of the easiest and most interesting ways to fulfill the ethical reasoning requirement.</comment>One of the best classes I've taken at Harvard. Dr. Jones is a great lecturer, the topics and readings were so interesting, I stayed motivated to do the readings and pay attention in lecture the whole semester. Konstantin is also a great TF - his style (a lot of cold-calling) is very intimidating, but he is extremely knowledgeable and his section definitely enhanced understanding of the readings and lectures.</comment></course>NEUROBIO 101hfl: Building Blocks of Neural Networks: Synapses and Circuits in Heath and Psychiatric Disease</title>It's fascinating, it's challenging in a good way, but it will require effort and extra work on your part if you've only a basic foundation of neurobiology, so only take it if you're willing to put in the extra brainpower.</comment>The workload is reasonable (submitting questions on 1-2 articles/week, 1 long presentation and 1 short presentation over the course of the semester), but it is very challenging material that you need to have some advanced neuro experience to fully appreciate. Designing an experiment and writing a grant proposal at the end of the semester was also more challenging than expected.</comment></course>HIST-LIT 90ay: Youth Protest in Europe</title>The class is challenging, but ultimately extremely rewarding. The format emphasizes discussion and critical thinking about protest in the 1960s, and the course materials have radically altered my perception of the implications of 1968. The class enables you to place 1968 in a larger context of protest and global historical events, to see connections between different movements at a particular historical moment, and to consider the aftereffects of 1968 on the world as a whole.</comment>If you do the readings for this course and engage in discussions, you will learn a lot in this class, both in terms of history and it terms of figuring out your own position on questions of effective protest and legitimacy of authority. However, the narrow scope of this course means that sometimes the same conversations get rehashed over and over again. If you aren't willing to talk a lot about the topics I listed above, this course might not be for you.</comment>The class was very good and I learned a lot. I already knew a lot about this time period, but I didn't know that much about what was going on in the European region. I'm really glad I learned about this. However, I think sometimes during the course assignments and due dates were a bit unclear and towards the end of the semester texts were often only available on the course website a day or two before the class, which made preparing for class difficult. I think if the class had been better organized I would have been able to push my participation in the class even further.</comment>Very well balanced and engaging</comment>Be willing to discuss. There will be interesting conversations.</comment>This was by far my favorite course of the semester. Professor Gillett is a wonderful teacher and person, and she genuinely likes getting to know her students and helping them grapple with readings or think through assignments. The course's topic is also really interesting.</comment>There's a ton of reading but it all is interesting and applicable. The discussions changed my view of so many current issues. I wish I could take this class all over again.</comment>I took this course hoping to get a taste of what it would be like to concentrate in history and literature, and I am extremely happy I did as I have now decided to be a Hist&Lit concentrator. Professor Gillett's extensive knowledge and passion for subject is very visible, and she is very accessible. The small size of course facilitates discussions in which everyone can take part, which is great change from larger history lectures in which the professor talks the entire time. Don't feel like you need to know anything at all about the topic going when starting the course. Between the engaging readings (which are truly relevant to the coursework; Prof. Gillett never had us read anything that we didn't discuss or wasn't of importance) and the contextualized information presented by Prof. to help us along, anyone could take this course and really enjoy it. With that being said, it would be helpful to have strong analytical skills and a level of comfortability working with sources to form a thesis.</comment>The readings are difficult and confusing, and it's really hard to build any sort of excitement about the topic even if you are interested in it already.  You get very little guidance on any of the assignments, and it's a lot more about politics and philosophical theory than the actual protest movements.</comment></course>PHYSICS 285a: Modern Atomic and Optical Physics I</title>This course will give you a solid foundation in many important topics in AMO physics. It is not an easy course and the problem sets can take a lot of work but you will get a lot out of them (the important points are highlighted after turning them in which is also great). I highly recommend this course to any student who wants to learn more about the current state of AMO research (which you will learn about through writing a review paper), or wants to learn some foundations of AMO calculations and topics. It is best if you have a little bit of AMO background, but not necessary. I wholeheartedly recommend taking a course with Prof. Gabrielse as well.</comment>This course has helped me develop familiarity with a number of the techniques I have used in lab. I was exposed to considerations that I did not come across on my own. This is a tremendously valuable course.</comment>The course was good overall, but would greatly benefit from a textbook or other additional resource. Adam (the TF) was extremely helpful overall.</comment>If you do not have concrete knowledge in amo physics, this couse could be a good start. Also this could be a good review for those who have already took corresponding amo courses previously.</comment>Valuable for anyone interested in AMO research - covers a useful assortment in topics in just enough detail.</comment>This class provides an intuitive picture to concepts useful in many different AMO topics. Problem sets could be tedious, but the solving them was a satisfying experience and not just a chore.</comment>This course is really nice particularly for someone who learns atomic physics for the first time as a graduate student. Prof. Gabrielse is an excellent instructor and will teach important theories, concepts and experimental methods in AMO in a slow but thorough manner. Workload is quite heavy but manageable if you can enjoy the class!</comment></course>HISTSCI 259: The History of the History of Science</title>This is a phenomenal course that all history of science grad students should take. It complements other courses really well, reaching back much further than most do to illustrate important developments in the field. The readings are diverse and incredibly illuminating about how science has been thought about over the last 100+ years. Professor Oreskes led rich, interesting discussions that made for a truly great course.</comment>A useful survey/ background of the field of the history of science and important turning points in historiography.</comment></course>COMPSCI 283: Computer Vision</title>This is an incredibly worthwhile class that exposes you to a breadth of image processing and computer vision algorithms. However, it isn't something to be underestimated. It's a tough class, but it thoroughly doable if you leverage office hours and collaborate with your peers.</comment>Prof. Zickler's lectures are very well-presented and engaging</comment>Make sure you have a decent linear algebra background (or if it's been a while since you've taken linear algebra, review the concepts) before taking the class! I hadn't taken linear algebra for several years, so I struggled many times in class because linear algebra concepts are essential to many of the algorithms and concepts in computer vision.  I thought this class was a great overview of the fundamental concepts and algorithms in computer vision, so definitely take it if you're interested in that field- there are many exciting applications! Zickler is a great lecturer and tries to give an intuitive understanding of the material, but he's not very available outside of class (he says he only eats in undergrad dining halls once a year maybe). The TF's were helpful at office hours but very slow to answer questions on Piazza.</comment>While computer vision sounds like a fascinating field, this class doesn't really demonstrate it that well. The lectures were on seemingly unrelated topics every week, and nothing seemed to connect together on a higher level. Also, I learned that Matlab is not very fun to code with.</comment>A very excellent and relatively easy class. You'll be exposed to many ideas and can get really creative with your final project</comment>Interesting material and clear lectures. Professor Zickler is awesome. Don't miss out on this class -- it is worth it. It is quite manageable and you will learn so much.</comment>Great course!</comment>Great class but a lot of work.</comment>It is challenging to fully, completely understand all the linear algebra behind the more complex algorithms and it's sometimes difficult to wrap your mind around the projective geometry. However, Professor Zickler is a fantastic teacher and makes it more intuitive and fun to learn. The problem sets and final project are extremely rewarding as you get to see the power of the algorithms you learn in class as you apply them to real problems. One of my friends said it very well: "The density of moments in this class that make you say 'Wow. I never thought about the world that way before.' is very high". If you put enough effort into this class to try to understand the material as well as possible, you will be very glad you did.</comment>Good first grad course as it's basically like an undergrad course with psets (in MATLAB sadly).</comment>This was a fantastic course. Extremely well taught, fun assignments, etc. Just be aware that problem sets were due on Mondays, generally eating up weekend days one might rather spend doing other things.</comment>I like the assignments. They enhance my knowledge learned from the class and they are so interesting.</comment>Excellent Course!  Professor Zickler is a great lecturer and definitely is enthusiastic about the subject.  You will learn a lot in the class.  Make sure however that you understand linear algebra well, or otherwise you will get lost in this class very quickly.</comment>This is a really cool course</comment>If you are at all interested in how 2-D images are created from the 3-D world and what you can do with these images, definitely take this class! There are so many interesting topics that I learned throughout the course, starting with projective geometry and homographies and ending with classifiers and face detection. This area of computer science is very exciting as new technologies are being invented.

There were 8 problem sets and 1 midterm and 1 final project. Each problem set had a mixture of coding and mathematical proofs, and the midterm was pretty comprehensive as it was held in mid November. The final project is an individual project and is pretty rewarding, as there are so many different topics to branch out to.</comment></course>GOV 1540: The American Presidency</title>You should take this one!</comment>This is a great class. Professor Porter is super interesting and the course gives a really good insight into the presidency.</comment>This class is exactly the kind of class I wanted to take at Harvard. I can't wait to take Professor Porter's Business and Government class in the future. His stories are incredible and his lectures are very interesting. Take this class if you want a fascinating introduction to the American Presidency. The assessments are fair and reasonable. I felt prepared for them. I would recommend this class to anyone (and have actually recommended it to several friends).</comment>The purpose of this course is to watch Roger Porter perform. Beyond that, what you will learn is rather vague or generic: "Presidents aim to make informed decisions" or "It is important to have a well organized Executive branch" -- there are no surprises in the material, and if you have a brain and are even mildly engaged with politics, you could probably figure out on your own most of what you will learn. The lectures are taped but not posted, which I think is a drawback of the course that seriously hinders the ability to review for exams. Nevertheless, this is a good course simply because Porter's excitement for the Presidency is infectious.</comment>Gov 1540 is a class with a fairly low weekly workload that is probably best taken as an elective- you should not expect to take away anything tremendously profound from the course, but is worthwhile to understand the office of the Presidency better than you did before, particularly from the perspective of a political scientists. Also, attending lecture is necessary, but it is not tedious, as Professor Porter has a methodical, deliberative way of lecturing. The 2 paper topics are not difficult, but they do require a significant amount of time if you wish to do well, as they require a lot of outside research and synthesis. As for the readings, they are usually not necessary on a weekly basis, but to do well on the essay components of the exams, you should know the basic arguments of authors from the readings in order to do well.</comment>Great class. You will definitely have to put in a little work, but you definitely get a lot out of the course.</comment>Make sure to keep up with the readings and you will be fine for the tests.</comment>This class is amazing!! The topic is extremely interesting and it's really helpful to understand the American presidency and learn about why presidents act the way they do. Additionally, Porter is one of Harvard's most incredible professor's. He is super engaging and he makes class very fun by telling stories of his times at the White House.</comment>Amazing course! Really makes you think about the President in a different light. And Professor Porter is just great. He is a great lecturer, and he really cares about the students. I enjoyed that he visited each section once and he gave us two inspirational speeches (read them and printed it out for us). That I found was great.</comment>Porter is such a cool guy and a great lecturer. I liked the class because of him.</comment>This a fantastic class and Professor Porter is fantastic.</comment>Its an interesting subject made far more interesting by the first-hand stories Professor Porter tells.  He's got a ton of cool stories worth taking the class to hear.</comment>This class was fantastic. Professor Porter is so knowledgeable and brilliant that I truly enjoyed listening the hour and a half lectures. I learned a tremendous amount, and would recommend this course over any other I have taken at Harvard thus far.</comment>TAKE THIS CLASS. Porter is a legend. If your not a gov. major don't worry! I'm a senior who has never taken a gov. class and I loved this course. A word to the wise though: get study materials from people in previous years because Porter tends to reuse questions and will forget that he didn't teach you something and then will test you on it.</comment>Class is pretty good. Professor Porter can sometimes get carried away with his war stories of being with various presidencies.</comment>This is the best class you will take at Harvard. Professor Porter is phenomenal. His real-world experience working in the White House provides a truly "Harvard" education. Furthermore, he teaches and instills in his students a great sense of moral virtue. You can learn a lot from him whether you are a beginner or expert in the field of government.  The course is always relevant to current happenings in the White House and U.S. politics. This alongside Professor Porter's stories make for a very engaging class. Definitely take it even if you are only slightly considering it!</comment>This is the best class I have taken thus far. It offers a rather comprehensive look into the office of the presidency in the context of other institutions and the outside world, and you also get a personal insight from Professor Porter. Porter's stories alone make it worth it to take American Presidency. And if you are lucky enough to have Jon as your TF, you will have a wonderful experience and really learn a lot from very experienced individuals.</comment>I'd take this class for the sole reason of being able to learn about the presidency from someone who worked in the West Wing for a number of years. Porter's stories are entertaining and really cool. There's a lot of reading-some of which doesn't seem too relevant. The essays and exams were quite difficult.</comment>great class, go to lecture</comment>it's a super easy class, but don't expect to get much out of it if your'e taking it for the grade.</comment>Professor Porter is absolutely wonderful, his combination of anecdote and normal lecturing makes the class profoundly interesting and insightful.</comment>This class can be redundant and it is hard to follow the outline of the lecture. Additionally, if you have ever taken a gov class before, you may find the material repetitive.</comment>Enroll in this class only if you are interested in stories of inconsequential relevance or if you want to boast to people back home that your Prof worked with a couple of President. Other than that, the course is only a superficial overview of the multiple aspects of the Presidency. Often, key ideas are repeated over and over again without new ideas.

Another problem I had with the course is that it is far from rigorous Political Science. It does not present many testable theories, and when it does the empirical treatment was confined only to atypical and unrepresentative anecdotal evidence. Too many times Prof. Porter presented his own theories as alternative to some of the reading authors', but he support those only by citing his experience in the White House. Undoubtedly his stories and experience are very interesting and important, but to advance our understanding of the Presidency more is needed. The course dealt with some of the most important ideas behind the American political system, such as the role of the executive, influence of the media, or the relationship between the three branches of the government, but trusting that Prof's Porter convictions about those are true and credible required a leap of faith that I was not willing to take.</comment>Readings and assignments aren't that difficult, and it's worth taking just to hear Porter lecture twice a week.</comment>Actually do the readings.</comment>This course is fantastic. Do the readings because they are great. Come to lecture because Porter tells fascinating stories. Great course.</comment>Fantastic class, you won't regret taking it</comment>Easily my favorite class at Harvard. Porter is interesting because he has the stories and experiences to teach the material from a first hand experience. It's also not a difficult class. Sophomores take note, this is a great punch class because the timing of assignments is convenient and the class starts at 11:40 (hopefully that doesn't change.) Very interesting class, you'll actually want to attend lecture. Nothing bad to say about it. Take it.</comment>Professor Porter has constructed a fascinating and engaging course appropriate for such a fascinating and engaging topic.  Lectures, sections, readings, exams and essays come together to give a full and interesting picture of the American Presidency.  And, as a cherry on top, Professor Porter turns each lecture into a 90 minute "School House Rock" episode with insightful and humorous personal stories of recent Presidential practices and actions.</comment>A great course with a GREAT professor. This course is worthwhile and one of the best you will have at Harvard.</comment>Professor Porter is one of the best lecturers I've had the pleasure to learn from, and I really enjoyed each class.</comment>This is a great class to take! You learn a ton from just sitting in lecture and there isn't really a lot of busywork. Professor Porter is extremely knowledgable, and it was great to hear what he had to say from his experience, even though I sometimes disagreed with his opinions. If you can, lottery for this class!</comment>The American Presidency may be a lot of work, but it was an extremely rewarding experience to take the course. Professor Porter and the TFs--Jon Palmer for sure--are knowledgeable and helpful. I learned so much both about American politics and history and about management and other critical life skills that I can apply in many instances. The course may be a lot of work, but every minute is well worth it.</comment>Will not regret taking this class.</comment>Professor Porter tells amazing stories, makes you obsessed with the presidency, and is one of the few remaining embodiments of the Paper Chase-style professor. He gets sidetracked a fair amount and doesn't always have enough material for 90 mins, but that's not something that should keep you from taking this. All the TFs with whom I've interacted are very intelligent and help you out a ton.</comment>This course was really interesting and I learned a lot. The lectures are full of great stories that are relevant to the material. I recommend this class.</comment>Do not be lead into thinking this class is the greatest class you can take at Harvard (many people think this to be true). There are a lot of experiences, yes. A lot of positive ones, yes. But also a lot of negative experiences. It is also sometimes TF-dependent, be aware.</comment>This course is great. Prof. Porter is a very entertaining lecturer and he provides a multitude of examples form his personal experience within the White House.</comment>This course might not be as easy as you expect, especially if it is your first ever Gov class. While the workload is very small, grading can feel very arbitrary based on your individual TF's expectations, and little guidance is given as to what's expected for the essays. Lots of reading, but unfortunately they are rarely incorporated into lecture of even section (which sometimes devolved into directionless discussion). Still a very interesting course, especially given Professor Porter's first-hand experience and great anecdotes. To hear his perspective is a one-of-a-kind opportunity, but you may leave the class feeling like you went to a semester's worth of "story time" without actually learning anything too substantial. (Still, not a bad as an elective.)</comment>A must take class from an amazing professor.</comment>This is an amazing course! Professor Porter is an amazing lecturer and his stories are very cool! Definitely worth taking this course!</comment>Professor Porter is an amazing professor with experiences you'll get to hear about that you won't find elsewhere. Be ready to focus though for an hour and a half. His lectures are somewhat unstructured and if you're not the type of person who learns well without a powerpoint, I would suggest reconsidering the course. That being said, it really is excellent. The readings are great as well.</comment>Take this class for the stories and for the amazing lectures, but don't expect a grade above or below a B+. The readings are important for the exams and the questions can be a bit nitpicky, but the class overall is not too difficult and can be what you make it. I recommend this class for the enjoyment but not necessarily for the grade or the material learned.</comment>This is one of my favorite courses that I've ever taken here. The lectures are incredible if you pay attention, and there were no points of frustration whatsoever. The readings were fascinating, and I definitely learned an amazing amount. Take this class, and hope you get into the lottery!</comment>read taming the prince to understand the theory on executive power... take this class to learn what the modern presidency is like day to day</comment>This course is as much about decision-making as it is about American government. It certainly teaches you about how American politics works, but it does so in a way that helps you think about how leaders make decisions more generally. Really useful if you're in a leadership position in your personal life.

Dr. Porter has taught this course for decades, and it shows. The lectures are well-structured, well-rehearsed, and delivered quite well. However, it sometimes seems that Dr. Porter gets bored with saying things he's said many times before, and he digresses into telling stories which can be of mixed quality. On the best of days, it is information about a president that nobody else has had before, which is genuinely cool. On the worst of days, it is a description of how cool Air Force One is, how cool it is that he's been on it, and a detailed description of how many toilets it has.</comment>Yes, this is the story class and it's totally OK to take it just for that. It also makes you think a lot more about the President's role and abilities outside of class.</comment>A background on American politics is very useful. Having a background of American presidential history would be particularly helpful in writing the papers. Students who don't have this background are at a disadvantage when writing the papers and participating in section.</comment>If you're interested in American politics, this is a dope class. A lot of what Professor Porter lectures about is just cool stories from when he worked in the White House. The workload isn't too bad and the concepts are pretty easy to understand. The course sort of loses steam towards the end, but it was definitely an enjoyable experience altogether.</comment>Porter is simply the best professor I have had here at Harvard.  He is a professor you will want to say you have taken a class from in your life.  Anyone from any concentration can take the class and do fine; government majors will likely have an upper hand in that case though.  Take advantage of going to a school with people like Roger Porter on campus.</comment>Great class that you should take before you graduate</comment>It's amazing</comment>Make sure to concentrate and enjoy the lectures. Dr. Porter rocks but sometimes I was too tired to pay attention. No need to do all the readings. Get a reading group.</comment>I would advise against taking this course. The assignments are not very clear and graded harshly, the exams are difficult to prepare for because the material isn't cohesive, and the lectures are dry. The suffering and annoyances are not worth what you get out of it at the end.</comment>It's not incredibly hard or time-consuming and you learn a lot about the presidency that you might not have considered before. At the same time, this course turned me off from being a gov concentrator. The lectures and readings were very redundant - Professor Porter's stories during lecture were great, but other than those he often just went over what was in the readings. If you want to be able to get by essentially with just lecture, then I guess it's not a bad class. But if you want lecture to give you something on top of readings, this isn't the one. In addition, many people rave about Professor Porter's lectures but I found many of them to be extremely slow - that's partially because they're long but also partially because on every topic he goes into historical examples/anecdotes that aren't always the most engaging.</comment>Presidency is a very interesting class without an unnecessary amount of work. Porter's lectures and stories are something you have to attend before you leave college.</comment>This is a highly interesting course. Professor Porter gives absolutely fantastic lectures and has some incredible stories. However, the essays might be a bit challenging if this is your first government class and are not totally sure about how to write a government paper.</comment>Professor Porter is worth the cost of admission.</comment>This class was great because of Professor Porter's stories and solid knowledge about the topic, but it is not as life-changing as the previous years' comments have made it to be. It's a great lecture on the American Presidency but don't expect too much from this course.</comment>Take it. It's a great class. Professor Porter is awesome.</comment>You will learn a great deal from this course and experience some of the best lectures this campus has to offer.  You will then be subject to some of the harshest paper and exam demands this campus has to offer (not all of them fair).  Your choice.</comment>Porter is a fun lecturer and has some great stories to tell. But if you're looking to understand the executive branch in a new or deeper way, this class might not be the best for you. There is relatively little structure to the curriculum, and the readings, while interesting themselves, are never really incorporated into the lectures or section very well. The papers were not interesting, but not overly challenging. Depends on how much you like listening to stories.</comment></course>EXPOS 20.059: Interpreting the Civil Rights Movement</title>This class is great for an expos class if you are interested in the Civil Rights Movement. That being said, it is challenging and really requires you to spend a large chunk of time considering how your writing can be improved.</comment>This class combines a learning experience in writing with an applicable and important topic. We were shown a diverse style of analytical writing. At the same time, exploring the civil rights movement in greater depth, serves as an necessary lesson for all young students.</comment>A great class about a really interesting topic--with a preceptor who is knows so much about teaching writing at this level and also about the civil rights movement.</comment>For an Expos class, the workload is manageable, and the grading is fair</comment>This course has many intriguing topics, but sometimes it can be a little dry. The workload is not unbearable, so it makes it fairly easy to juggle this course with other courses.</comment>You learn a lot.</comment>This is a uniquely helpful course. Many people complain about Expos, which is often understandable, because it's a purely writing course and feels unnecessary. However, this course didn't have much work and helped me to evaluate my writing.</comment>Very well taught and really helpful.</comment>It's a great class, not an unnecessary workload, and has interesting material. I recommend this strongly.</comment>Wonderful class</comment>This class is amazing and its the perfect Expos class to take. The work is not overwhelming, and the assignments perfectly prepare you for your essays. Additionally, Ariane is extremely nice and the subject matter of the class is very interesting.</comment></course>ECON 980aa: The Rise of Asia and the World Economy</title>Dale is incredible. He makes himself available to students and is excited about the topic.</comment>Professor Jorgenson is very knowledgeable and I really enjoyed attending his lectures and the students' presentations. Having some prior knowledge regarding Asian economies is not a prerequisite, however, it is recommendable. Find the datasets you need for your paper early (!) in the semester, it will save you a lot of stress at the end. Do attend Professor Jorgenson's and Wentao's office hours regularly, it will help a lot!</comment>I loved the course! Definitely got to apply a lot of the skills that I learned in earlier classes to the research paper in this class, which was really valuable since I was able to learn a lot during the process.</comment>This is a fun class with a relatively light workload but quite interesting subject matter. You'll get to learn about the latest Asian economic developments and discuss them in a fairly congenial setting. The paper is also a good opportunity to flex your research muscles, though think very carefully about data sources before you choose your topic. Professor Jorgenson is one of the nicest professors in the Ec Department--go to his office hours!</comment>I recommend this course very much. The insights that Professor Jorgenson offers in class about the economic issues in China, India, and Japan are very interesting and relevant to the current state of the world economy. Final paper and student presentation are also two large parts of this course, and if you seek guidance during the course of the semester, the experience will become even more rewarding.</comment>This a great course to learn about the growth of Asian economies, and learn how to conduct focused independent research.</comment>This class can be chill with little time commitment if you want it to be. But both Professor Jorgenson and the TFs are wonderful resources and you can get so much out of the course beyond the lectures if you put in extra time and effort.</comment>If you are interested in Asian Economy, I'd highly recommend this course. Professor Jorgensen is a really great professor. He gives a lot of valuable feedback and tries his best to get to know every of his students. You will have to write a 25 page paper about a economic topic of choice and it helps a lot if you are already comfortable with STATA, but if you struggle with something you have some great resources available. This was for sure one of my favorite classes I had so far.</comment>The class itself covers very interesting topics.  You will leave this class with a solid understanding of Asian markets and the global economy.  It is not overly difficult every week as the only graded assignments are a presentation and a final paper, but those two assignments are difficult.  There is a lot of support from the teaching staff, and you will be prepared for the final paper.  If you are thinking of writing a thesis, this class will be helpful.  Professor Jorgenson does a great job of meeting with students and even takes us out to dinner.  The class itself is tough, but you will learn a lot about the topics.</comment>Jorgenson is great! You get to dine with him and his wife for class dinner. You get a lot of 1 on 1 time with the Professor.</comment></course>JAPAN 150a: Readings and Discussion in Japanese Social Sciences</title>Solid class, but the pacing of the course was a bit rough compared to previous years (fourth and below). The semester started off normally in terms of due dates (a presentation every week and a half or so), but towards the end of the semester it felt like there was something major due all the time. While all of the material was interesting, it would be nice to cover not just history and politics, but also culture. The instructors were always available (through office hours or appointments) to meet with students, and were very supportive throughout the entire semester. If you want to do well, be ready to dedicate a decent amount of time on this course. I would recommend this class for people who enjoy debating about/discussing controversial issues.</comment>A fantastic course. The focus on readings (as opposed to quizzes on grammar/vocab/kanji) makes it very enjoyable and interesting. Discussing interpretations of the readings with classmates was a lot of fun, too :).  Also, can we have more debates? Those were a lot of fun :).</comment></course>SOCIOL 29: Introduction to Urban Sociology</title>Keep up with the readings! It's not hard to do but it's easy to push them off, and they are usually pretty interesting and quickly read.</comment>This course is a true introductory course. It covers a pretty broad range of sociological interest and doesn't get into the nitty-gritty of the theory. The readings are interesting and really relevant, both to current events and the course. The workload is totally manageable and fitting to an introductory level course</comment>This class confirmed my decision to become a Sociology concentrator. I had hesitated because the only other Sociology class I took was a poorly organized one in the past semester and since this class was also a new class, I was very apprehensive. However, this class exceeded my expectations. I LEARNED so much, which is more than I can say for a lot of introductory classes. I liked the combination of theories and ethnographies and studies. Rosen is a great lecturer and very sweet and Jasmin is a great section leader and is very good at synthesizing thoughts and clarifying concepts.</comment>This is a great introduction to urban sociological theory. Even though it's in the intro sociology series, it really is specific to study of the city. That said, there are many very interesting topics related to inequality, race, and economics. The class is also very specific to the American city.</comment>The class deals with race in American cities in such a way that you leave each lecture feeling compelled to action.</comment>If you're interested in sociology at all, don't be afraid to take this course! It's not that demanding (although the readings can get dry), and it covers a lot of fascinating topics.</comment>Pretty theory-based, but definitely an interesting class that relates to current events. I really enjoyed it and the workload was not too terrible.</comment>If you've taken more than 2 or 3 Sociology courses in the past, chances are you've already learned about at least one of the weeks of the course. I guess this can be nice, but keep that in mind if you're looking to learn brand-new things.</comment>See the sociology writing person's office hours. They grade kind of hard on papers. Write to strengths and limitations of theories and try not to discuss only one when you can discuss two. Try to do all the readings -- they're good. You will feel like you learned a lot from this class if you do the readings--also a good intro to sociology.</comment>Very well-taught course. Material is engaging, and TF and professor are excited and knowledgeable about it. Provides broad overview of an introduction to sociology for those new to the department or concentration. Can also serve as a nice elective course if you need something interesting and not that hard to finish off your schedule. Easily my favorite class this semester and I'm really hoping to have another course with the same professor (Eva Rosen) in the future.</comment>The subject material of this class is fascinating for anyone, even if you don't plan on studying sociology. The readings weren't too difficult, and the professor and TF were positive and down to earth, making the class environment a lot more comfortable and open.</comment>Lots of fun, you will feel like a sociologist yourself by the end of it!</comment>This is absolutely my favorite course I've taken at Harvard. Professor Rosen is great, the material is really interesting, the essays are actually enjoyable, and overall I really feel like a learned a lot about a really relevant topic. 100% recommend this class.</comment>Loved the material, but I think the overall teaching could go a bit more beyond its current mediocre level.</comment>Liked the class, TF (Jasmin) was especially good, liked Professor a lot, think she will be more comfortable teaching it after her first year.</comment>I would 100% recommend taking either this course or another taught by Professor Rosen. She was very good at explaining theories and presenting them clearly. I had never studied Sociology before and it proved to be a great introduction, making me feel that I have covered a wide range of topics. The workload is definitely manageable, though the size of the readings can vary from pretty small some weeks to quite lengthy, such as when we had to read an entire book. Overall though it was definitely one of my most enjoyable courses this semester.</comment>Extremely fun and interesting course! An amazing introduction into the department and one of the bigger reasons why I decided to concentrate in Sociology. Professor is great, flexible, and engaging. The readings and assignments are relevant and fun. The sections are both informative and makes you think. Wonderful class.</comment>You will have to pull your weight and the grading is not super easy, but you will learn a lot about the inequality around America that is sometimes invisible to us. If you haven't taken a sociology course before, this is a good place to start.</comment>This class is very interesting and teaches about some of those issues that became so timely this year with everything that happened regarding Ferguson and non-indictments. Sometimes, however, the class kind of feels like it has no true point or final destination. We talk about theories and how they're related but we never seem to get a full analysis in there.</comment>You will likely learn a  ton about the sociology of an urban environment.</comment>This course applied what we learned about urban sociology to current events. It was also very engaging and more hands-on than I expected.</comment></course>PHYSCI 10: Quantum and Statistical Foundations of Chemistry</title>A pretty painless way to get a physical chemistry requirement out of the way. Overall, we learned some pretty interesting concepts and it wasn't too much work (compare to other science classes...)</comment>Take this class. It's tricky but so interesting and so so worth it.</comment>A very useful introduction to quantum mechanics and statistical thermodynamics that is well-suited for advanced freshmen or other underclassmen. I would recommend this as a lead in to the new Python-based Chem 160 under Aspuru-Guzik if you have time. For upperclassman CPB concentrators, this could be a viable Chem 160 alternative (I chose this to avoid being in what would have effectively been 160’s first year), but it does require a familiarity with differential equations and calculus that might be quite rusty by junior / senior year, especially if you haven’t taken any math since freshman year.</comment>I loved the course overall, and Adam is very good at explaining things. The only bad part was the final project: it was stressful and difficult.</comment>Great class - kudos to Professor Cohen</comment>If you are looking for an easy class, this is not the class for you. If you are, however, looking for a class that questions how you view science and the quantum mechanical properties that make everything possible, this is the perfect class for you! Get ready to work hard and spend time at office hours, but get ready for a rewarding experience that I proudly call my favorite class this semester.</comment>Loved learning all the foundations of the formulas and concepts I learned high school AP chemistry. The biggest strength of PS10 was its teaching staff--Adam is great, and Lu and Amymarie are fantastic resources. They really care about you and help you prepare for exams!</comment>This class requires a lot of work and is much different that high school chemistry.</comment>I loved PS10 and I would definitely recommend it if Adam and Lu are teaching next year. Although the class is very hard and moves very fast (whirlwind survey of quantum mechanics and thermodynamics!), there is so much support that it is not difficult to keep up provided you are willing to work hard.
The final project is also an amazing experience.</comment>This class is very difficult but the teaching staff and material are absolutely great. If you are interested in this subject matter, the teaching staff does a great job applying what we learn in class to a lot of different applications. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND taking this course (even if you are a bio/life sciences concentrator) because it is a great way to learn some foundational physical sciences. Overall, positives: subject material, teaching staff***, applications. Negatives; difficulty.</comment>The teaching staff for this class is absolutely fantastic - they are all so helpful, personable, and open. There is a strong community relationship in the class, especially between freshmen. The class is challenging - very, very challenging. It was at times a rough adjustment from high school, but I learned so much and am so thankful for the relationships I made through the course.</comment>If you have an interest in science but don't know how it relates to the rest of the scientific disciplines, take this course. I am a physics major, and so many of the things I learned up until this class seemed to be of little relevance to the real world because the situations were so specific and contrived</comment>If you are looking forward to a good introduction for college Quantum Mechanics and Statistical Mechanics, this is a very great class. Adam is an amazing lecturer and we learn a lot of concepts; at the end of the year, he will remind you of the topics you learned and you will be pleasantly surprised. The TFs are very helpful and they will literally help you with EVERYTHING so if you have questions, feel free to ask them and they will gladly help you out. The tests may be a bit rough, but I've gotten so much out of this course. If you need an interesting general chemistry (and somewhat challenging for those who are less math/physics inclined), then this class is for you. Do not be intimidated though; some background in chemistry and physics with single variable calculus is all you need! Also, we make ice cream with liquid nitrogen at the end of the year, along with the luncheon for final project; how great is that?</comment>This is a very time-consuming course, but can be rewarding if you are willing to put the effort into it. The material is very challenging, and be prepared for a lot more math than what you would expect from a chemistry class. Deriving formulas and theories is often frustrating and slow, but the application at the end is usually interesting. Don't let yourself fall behind in the material. Definitely seek out Lu's help if you take this course! She is a life saver.</comment>The class is very difficult and a lot of work, but it is definitely worth it. You can always get help, and all members of the teaching staff are super accessible.</comment>This course is wonderful! Every teaching staff so enthusiastic, and they truly want to help you every step of the way. I have to say that it is a very difficult chemistry course because nobody has seen any of the material from a high school background (mostly quantum mechanics). The tests are extremely hard as well. However, the satisfaction you get once you mastered the material is priceless.</comment>This is a great class! All the teaching staff are extremely supportive and helpful. It's not an easy one though, and if you put a lot in, you will get a lot out. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and would recommend.</comment>This class is a bast if you are really interesting in engaging in depth with quantum mechanics and the workings that govern the minuscule as well as large. This class though is not a walk and the park and with require lots of preparation within fields that are likely to be hard to grasp since the object of study is too small to ever see. The class though is a lot of fun with many in-class displays of science.</comment>This course, although quite challenging, is very rewarding in the end. Especially, at the symposium for final projects, as you truly realized how much you have learned over the span of the course.</comment>If you don't mind working hard and putting in a lot of time, then this class is really rewarding.  You learn SO much and it exposes you to a lot of different aspects of chemistry.  This was my hardest class, but my favorite class.</comment>It is very worthwhile and very challenging. I definitely recommend it to anyone who is genuinely interested in the material and willing to work hard to comprehend it.</comment>This is the best course I have taken at Harvard so far–I really have nothing but high praises for the teaching staff and the material. To begin, the material covered in this class strikes a fantastic balance between mathematical thinking and conceptual discussions. My mind was blown several times throughout the course as we discussed quantum mechanics and thermodynamics, and honestly the way I view chemistry (from atoms to reactions) is forever altered in the most pleasant way. And this evaluation would not be complete without mentioning the ridiculously fantastic teaching staff. Professor Cohen is THE BEST–his office hours were the highlight of the semester, I mean you get to ask all these weird questions about quantum mechanics that you've always wondered about and he will explain things to you clearly and satisfactorily, it's the best thing ever. Not to mention the remarkable Lu Wang and Amymarie, who are extremely approachable and devoted to the class. (How many TFs answer your questions sent late at night within 10 minutes?) 

In summary, take this course. It's sufficiently challenging but certainly doable, and just worth it.</comment>The material for this class is fascinating and not exceedingly difficult.  Study for midterms and you will do well.</comment>This course has the best, most understanding, most helpful teaching staff of any class I've taken. The professor, preceptor, and TFs are so accessible, and it's clear they want to help you succeed. PS10 is more difficult than other typical pre-med courses, but it's worth it to know that you're not wasting your time and that you're learning something new that is worthwhile, especially if you're considering concentrating in any chemistry-related field. This is also the most fair and reasonable course I've taken. There are no problem sets or labs the weeks of exams, and the staff holds plenty of extra office hours the weekends before exams so that you have lots of opportunities to ask questions and review. For the final project, you are assigned to an adviser (a member of the staff) that is dedicated to your success, and you are also welcome to ask other members of the staff for guidance. In general, this is an amazing class that I guarantee you will not regret taking. It might seem difficult in your first week, depending on your background, but stick with it at least through the first test and watch yourself grow as a student among some of the nicest, most helpful faculty Harvard has to offer.</comment></course>ANTHRO 1610: Ethnographic Research Methods</title>Lectures are long, and if you don't make an effort to stay engaged then you will probably find them dry. Otherwise, the course is perfect if you're interested in conducting ethnographic research. Professor Ralph, Zoe, and Billy are committed to making the material relevant to the students' research. If you need a methods course, take this one!</comment>This class teaches you what anthropology is and about the various methods that anthropologists use, which is very important. However, I felt the assignments for the class were too many. We had to write 3 pages single-spaced for the class very week which I felt were way too many and did not give us enough time to engage with the methods and develop our ideas about each method. However, I still did learn a lot about the ethics of research and the nuts and bolts of anthropology which is knowledge I know will serve me a long time to come.</comment>I thought students had to do a lot of self-teaching and experiential learning in this class. Since the coursework for the class is mostly a series of small ethnographic projects with very open-ended prompts and instructions, I felt like learning and growth were predicated on student effort and attention to the class to a much greater extent than in other courses. For instance, one course assignment essentially asks students to conduct participant observation in a public place with a research question in mind and then to write a four page paper about the experience. Since students had to choose both a location and a research question (as well as how much they would engage with others at their research site), student thought and preparation in designing the study and student presence and effort doing field research determined a lot of what students, to my mind, could get out of the course. With that in mind, I would recommend that students try to take this course in perhaps an easier semester or one in which there is ample time to spend thinking about these exercises, because that is how a student will get the most out of this class.</comment>You have to take this course if you are an anthropology concentrator so might as well enjoy it. I personally did my best to find the most interesting topics I could for each weekly assignment which were basically applications of the 'method of the week'. However, due to the terrible timing of the assignments/lectures/sections, explanations of how to conduct the necessary research or work for the assignments were at the barest minimum and left me more often than not, confused and alone in my attempts at completing the assignments. Also, there is also a workshopping of two of the submitted assignments from the past week which was good for like 10 minutes. After that, it's a whole hour of saying the same things and lectures were basically just like that.</comment>You can orient all the projects in whichever direction you want to. This is really cool if you're planning on working on a thesis.</comment>The main learning experience of this class comes from assignments and practical discussions about different methods. TFs are very helpful and open. However, lectures and often sections are a waste of time. The same things could be covered in twice as less time with more intensity.</comment>This class is an incredible opportunity to study the culture and environment we live in at Harvard and work with great anthropologists. It is a fantastic class in which, if you're an adventurous person, you'll do some of the most worthwhile research on campus. The sections are amazing, especially if Zoe is your TF. The lectures are alright, they go on for too long, but they only meet once a week for 2 hours and the environment is very relaxed. It is a lax class where you pretty much get exactly what you put in to it. I loved it, I would encourage everyone to take it, since it will cause you to critically examine everything around you in a fantastically interesting way.</comment>This is a great hands-on course where you can practice being an anthropologist and performing fieldwork.  It really gives a great overview of the different qualitative methods, which is great if you're going to do a thesis involving qualitative research. You will also get to learn about the evolution and history behind the field of anthropology as well as ethical questions, which was interesting.</comment>This course taught us a lot about ethnography and was incredibly manageable work-load-wise...I loved it! How much you'll enjoy this class mostly depends on the TF, because they're really the one who will be interacting with the ethnography you do, but Zoe is amazing!</comment>This class was helpful in the end, but a little disorganized. If it becomes more organized in the future, this class will be a more valuable introduction to ethnographic research.</comment></course>CULTR&BLF 45: The History of the English Language</title>HoTEL is a pretty decent class to satisfy the CB requirement if you find English interesting. The workload is pretty front-loaded, and this is also some of the less interesting material, so do be prepared for that, but overall it's pretty painless. The assignments aren't very enjoyable, but some lectures are interesting and the midterm was fair (have not taken final yet).</comment>TAKE THIS CLASS! I don't often take classes outside of my field(s) of interest, but among those that I already took (or was forced to take) this one is the best. We learn random things about the English language, something that we use everyday but probably don't give much thoughts to. The teaching staff are so nice and they truly try their best to make this class a pleasant experience and to make sure students still learn something. Everyone in this class whom I have talked to really like it: either the historical part or the linguistics part, or both!</comment>This course will teach you fascinating material about the history of the English language--unfortunately, the material won't really be applicable in many other fields, but nevertheless, it is fascinating stuff.</comment>Careful not to let the reading and workload get on top of you. Surprising amount of specifics and dates to keep up on.</comment>Professor Donoghue is a solid lecturer, and the work is not very difficult. This is an excellent way to fulfill either AIU or CB.</comment>This is a great way to explore an interest in linguistics without committing to a more demanding course in the linguistics department.  It is definitely a mix of technical linguistics and history, and some memorization of Old English.  If this doesn't sound interesting to you then I would look somewhere else for a CB or AI.  This being said the teaching staff is awesome and Professor Donoghue clearly cares about the course and the subject.  The guest lecturers at the end of the course are also fascinating.</comment>Sections can sometimes focus on only particular homework assignments, which is a bit unfortunate. Overall, this class is pretty fun, has decent projects that end up being pretty interesting, and a great teaching staff.</comment>An excellent class for those interested in language. Great for people with high or low experience levels.</comment>Take this course if you're looking for a gen ed that isn't too much work, but will leave you with loads and loads of interesting factoids about how the English language developed</comment>This was a GREAT way to get CB. It was extremely interesting, fun, and zero work.
Professor Donoghue can be dull at times but the quality of the material makes up for it, as does his genuine passion for it.
The only work we had to do were the four projects, which were very fun (and short!) and allowed for a lot of creativity.
I actually enjoyed taking the exams for this class, where we were given a word bank and asked to write an essay that threaded them together. It tested your familiarity with the arc of the course rather than the minute details, which I thought was really innovative.</comment>Take it if you can. It's a relatively painless way to get rid of the CB requirement.</comment>The class is very relaxed with the professor bringing interesting points into lecture and section using assignments to clarify lecture points. My TF was awesome and showed us pretty cool stuff. Good GenEd. Don't be scared of the work in the beginning- it is not that much and you go over it in class.</comment>Very front-heavy, almost linguistics course. 
Focuses on literally the history of English language, such as its gradual change from the Indo-European language to modern English.</comment>A truly great gen ed class. Not a lot of work, very interesting, excellent teaching staff. Not only did this course change the way I view language, but it also influenced the way I view education at Harvard in general. It's a phenomenal introduction to linguistics and language, and teaches us how people have connected with each other in the most fundamental and meaningful of ways over time. We cover not only the historical developments, but also the cultural ones--and poignant issues such as race, profanity, and pop culture are addressed in intriguing detail. No other class will allow you to swear openly, or talk about the etymology of "twerk."</comment>Sometimes the class feels a lot like high school--paper worksheets, memorizing useless things like exact dates, having to print out everything instead of just bringing a laptop, etc. However, the material is quite different than other culture and belief courses, so if this is what you are more interested in, these are just hoops to jump through you will have to deal with. If it's any consolation, since you're at this university, you're probably really good at high school-style classes.</comment>The class is very interesting and you learn as much as you put into it. Pay attention and do the work and it's a great class; do it part way and you don't get anything out of it.</comment>If you're interested in History and Linguistics, this is a very interesting class. Workbook tasks can be tedious but the readings are interesting and overall the class is structured well.</comment>This is a great class and a perfect way to fill the culture and belief gen ed. Teaching staff really cares about the students and keeping the class interesting and fun. Grading is fair, not harsh, and the class doesn't kill you toward the end of the semester which is great. TAKE IT. DD rocks.</comment>That it is definitely a good intro to linguistics and a great foundation for the History of the English Language but that not all the assignments we are supposed to do are largely irrelevant and that section times are not long enough to actually practice the material.</comment>Super painless way to knock out a very flexible gen ed. You learn really cool stuff about English and Prof Donoghue does his best to keep it always entertaining (there was a lecture with dogs!). Midterm was simple and week-to-week work is very casual. Erica Weaver is also a banging TF</comment>Awesome class. Very interesting material. Teaching staff is awesome and cares that you enjoy the class. Not a stressful learning environment.</comment>This is a super interesting class if you're at all into linguistics (or think you might be), and Professor Donoghue is really great. Activities for section are actually pretty time-consuming, though, so the idea of the class as easy is a bit misleading. Also, the thing is that section participation is a sizable portion of your grade but if you haven't done the activities then you're out of luck.</comment>If there is one Gen Ed that you should take at Harvard, it should be this course. Waking up Mondays and Wednesdays for this class was a pleasure, because I knew I would be entertained by a fantastic and funny lecturer challenging my thinking about both the English language and society. While the topic may seem irrelevant for every day life, the information I learned came up surprisingly often when talking to friends about their dialects and about quirks in the English language. The work load is pretty light, but don't take the course because it's easy; take it because it's a chance to experience a Gen Ed that actually meets the envisioned ideals of the system.</comment>If you like linguistics, this class is perfect for you.</comment>This is my least favorite course I have taken at Harvard. It is completely disorganized. Trying to find themes that tie the course together is almost impossible. 

Once you get into the second half of the course, the units become random topics that mostly amount to common knowledge. The course lacks enough material and thus supplants it with guest speakers, and you will find that a topic or fact is brought up in four or five lectures making much of the class repetitive.

The workbook assignments amount to piles of busywork. They don't inform your learning, yet they take hours to complete if you actually do them. 

All in all an extremely unsatisfying course, although I have to say the TFs did try extremely hard and were very invested in the class.</comment>This course is a gem! A delightful blend of linguistics with literature and history, presented in an engaging, accessible way. It should be taken by everyone.</comment>This course might be interesting if you don't know too much about the English language, but if you do it will seem like a lot of old news and/or rote memorization.</comment>This class has a lot of things going for it but also a good amount of improving to do. I feel like I learned more cool trivia than I did concepts and new ways of looking at the world. The the first half of the course is much more labor-intensive and difficult than the second half. The sections were also of inconsistent quality. If you really want to get into the linguistics, this is the class for you, but I was hoping there would be more social history of English too.</comment>The teaching staff is quite nice, but the material is exceptionally boring. I came in excited for this class, but it ended up 95% busy work. Exams are pure memorization -- long lists of how vowels changed over time. There are no concepts to understand or ideas to learn.</comment>This class is a really interesting gen ed if you're interested at all in linguistics or English. The first half of the class is more structured/comprehensive then it gets kind of unfocused after the midterm when you start learning about modern English. All in all a cool class with a pretty light workload.</comment>seemed like a lot of fun, but wasn't</comment>A great way to fulfill CB. This class is always interesting and not a lot of work, except at the very beginning. Seriously--when you are stressed out writing term papers, you will be glad that you took this course because the workload decreases *so* much over the course of the semester.</comment>Take this course if you're interested in viewing the English language in a new way. It's not a very rigorous courses but the lectures are interesting and the TFs are great.</comment>HOTEL is pretty great as far as GenEds go. It taught me a lot about how the English language has evolved over the years, something that is fairly interesting to most people. Moreover, the work is very reasonable, which makes it an even more enjoyable class to take.</comment>Good and interesting course.</comment>This class was incredibly fun, but don't be fooled by the first few introductory lectures. It is a HISTORY course, after all, so there are a lot of dates and historical facts to memorize. This isn't just fun with semantics and syntax, which is how it might come across at the beginning. But the material is very interesting, and it's useful for a variety of subjects, from inventing your own language (for you fiction writers out there) to understanding cultural migrations, especially in England. It's a lot of value for not a lot of work. The readings are always interesting, and the guest speakers provide incredible insight to other aspects of English history. As a bonus, they're also a hoot. Professor Donoghue also has very adorable dogs that he brings to class to help out.</comment>Definitely the best gened I've taken at Harvard. Super interesting content with a pretty light workload - there's definitely more work at the beginning of the semester than at the end. I think there's a small chance you'll get bored if you don't have any interest in linguistics, but I loved learning the content.</comment>If you are interested in the topic, then absolutely take this class. I learned a lot, was constantly interested in the subject matter, and didn't have to do too much work. However, if it isn't really your thing, then it might not be worth it. Donoghue isn't a particularly gripping lecturer, no matter how pleasant he may be, and I think someone who wasn't interested on their own would fail to be interested by his presentation of the material.</comment>This class is love/hate, and I hated. If you enjoy linguistics then I think you may like the class. If you do not, do not be deceived this is not the class for you.</comment>I would like to tell future students that even though there are long stretches of time where there are no assignments or evaluations, they should be keeping up on the readings and activities so that they are prepared for exams.</comment>This is a fun, easy, and interesting class! It satisfied the language enthusiast and grammar nerd in me, and it didn't take much work. The assignments were fun compared to straight-up papers, and the midterm was straightforward.</comment>You should take this class! At first the readings will seem really technical and boring, but the readings aren't that important anyways. The material is actually kind of neat and you'll learn quite a bit. It's also not very hard to do well in at all.</comment>The assignments in this course are extremely unenjoyable. You will not come out of this class having learned anything enlightening.</comment>Ended up being a very interesting class -- however, I signed up thinking it was a history class, and it ended up being a history of the phonemic changes in English. Still interesting, and always make sure to read the syllabus for classes!</comment>As long as you're willing to memorize some linguistic details, this class is a fun way to learn a lot about how the English language developed. You might think it would teach you new grammar rules, but actually it makes you call into question whether we even need to follow the rules we already know!</comment>It's a tough one, though I expect it seems less difficult if you put more time into it.</comment>CB 45 is an excellent course through and through!  It is taught by Professor Donaghue who is engaging and exciting to listen to in lecture!  He makes the material approachable and easy to understand, but still teaches a great amount over the course of the semester.  The lectures are interesting and the outside work is minimal compared to other classes.  If the subject matter described in the syllabus sounds interesting to you, then this is a great call class.  Also Adrienne is an awesome TF!!</comment>This class was relatively easy, but it was also one of the most boring and useless classes I've taken at Harvard.  You do not learn any concepts in this class, only facts (i.e. who wrote what Dictionary in 1828, what sound changes occurred from 1400-1700).  The way the class is taught is also frustratingly disorganized.</comment>This class will let you know what made the English language be like it currently is. It is interesting, and worth a look.</comment>It's not the most interesting, but its not too much work- very little at the end of the semester when other courses ramp up which was really, really nice.</comment>I found the information we learned to be neither interesting or useful.  Lectures were not very engaging, exams required a lot of memorization, and the projects were not very enjoyable.  The TFs are great, but I would look elsewhere to satisfy your Gen Ed.</comment>This class is excellent! It's a perfect class if you need a lighter workload to balance a heavy schedule. The bookends of the course focus on extremely relevant an interesting contemporary topics, while the middle of the course focuses on a lot of history of the ancestors of the English language. If you're a stickler for grammar, you'll love this course! Great professor, engaging TFs, very light workload.</comment>Great class that was well taught</comment>This class is incredibly interesting but not super easy. The type of work required is most similar to a foreign language class.</comment>Fun, easy, John is the best TF ever!</comment>It's really easy, but it doesn't provide much. I felt like it was kind of a waste of time. The assignments were just busy work. I was very disappointed.</comment>the lectures are a little dry, and the midterm and final are definitely cram tests, but i did like the overall themes of the class</comment>This class is kind of a mixed bag. The first half of the course will be very frustrating but the second half of the course is pretty cool. If you take this course, definitely take it with friends. It will make a huge difference.</comment>Great class, especially as a 5th class. It teaches you introductory linguistics while actually telling you the story of the English language in a way that is accessible to those who don't have any historical or English background. The professor and teaching staff are very accessible and care about students. They made it clear that this class was not about the grade but about us understanding the material. Definitely great environment!</comment>I learned a whole lot and had a fun time doing it. The title of this course might seem dry, but you'll be surprised at how much you'll enjoy learning about something you use everyday.</comment>It is an excellent Gen Ed: the material is interesting, even fascinating, especially for someone with any sort of linguistic inclination - and the workload is more than manageable.</comment>It's a somewhat haphazard course at times, just because they're trying to pick specific things out of a really vast subject, but it's generally interesting. Professor Donoghue is a very decent lecturer, if not an outstanding one. I'd say the course is solid but not actively great.</comment>The first month or so will be much more difficult than the rest of the course. Learning the phonetic alphabet/dealing with Old English can be challenging but once you move past that it really gets a lot more chill.</comment></course>HIST-LIT 90bh: Postcolonial Ireland</title>This is a great class, and provides an interesting approach to post-colonial theories as well as gives a broad sense of Irish 19th-20th century history.</comment>For a hist and lit class, this class was awesome, and if you're interested in Irish history, it was also awesome. Because it's an intense, small seminar, I wouldn't recommend it as just a casual class. But Mo is fantastic, so I would definitely recommend any class with her.</comment>I know the topic of post-colonial Ireland might not seem very interesting at first. But it's actually an academic and historical wonder: a British colony, or just part of Greater Britain? Is Ireland really post-colonial? The class certainly addresses some very core questions for those with an interest in both Irish history and postcolonial theory in general. Not to miss.   Otherwise, Mo is an amazing, passionate and engaging teacher. The class is not too much work, but there are number of assignments along the way that make for some busy weeks. Plus you get to read some cool/weird Irish novels and plays that you might never get another chance to explore, beyond Joyce and Wilde.</comment>You read so many cool books that comprehensively explore the intersection of both Irish history + culture and postcolonial experiences! It's a very cool class in that its existence itself is sort of what you're trying to explore. There's a lot of writing and reading, though, but it's a sophomore tutorial, so you knew that already. Half of the class weren't sophomores and an even larger percentage weren't hist&lit concentrators, so don't hesitate to take this course for some kickass history and literature fun if you don't officially belong to that group.</comment>This was a really great course that gave us a chance to read some fascinating literature and engage with history. As a non hist&lit concentrator, I found it gave me a lot of useful skills in historical and literary analysis that I might use elsewhere. Professor Moulton is incredible: accessible, understanding, knowledgeable, and very skilled at guiding discussions: not too heavy-handed, but knows when to step in with useful questions or insights. The small class size was also fantastic. This was one of those rare classes where everyone clearly did the readings every week. I learnt a lot about Ireland, and through it, about the many themes that relate to its remarkable rise over the last century.</comment></course>EXPOS 20.194: Dangerous Speech</title>If you are interested in law this is a great expos to take, because you're both fulfilling the expos requirement while taking an interesting class about the first amendment. While I would have preferred that we spent a little more discussing the case studies than discussing the papers, the class was overall very interesting.</comment>it is more interesting than most expos classes</comment>Hands down, the best Expos class you can take. The essays were all fun to write (In the second unit, you're a Supreme Court Justice writing the Opinion of the Court on a tough free speech case), the readings were all relevant (mostly Supreme Court decisions), and Dr. Ziparo is an incredible preceptor. Your writing will improve, I guarantee it.</comment>Even though I have grown a lot as a result of this class, it is very difficult to manage with my other classes.</comment>As a first-semester freshman, you hear all sorts of Expos horror stories from upperclassmen, PAF's, etc. This course is not one of those horror stories. Dr. Ziparo is very passionate about the class, and is very up to date on the law and developments of the First Amendment. The reading assignments and response papers are doable, although the essays are tough. I certainly feel as though my writing has improved somewhat, and I learned a significant amount about a topic I knew close to nothing before taking this class. (First Amendment law)I would say that Dr. Ziparo's greatest achievement, aside from providing good comments on essays, and being available to discuss ideas, is making this course relevant to wide range of people. I would recommend this class as a rewarding, but fairly difficult, expos.</comment>Topic was not very interesting to me, but still found it engaging!</comment>This class is an interesting way to fulfill the Expository Writing Requirement. Dr. Ziparo's essay assignments will get you thinking and help you improve the way you approach college writing. Overall, the class provides an interesting way though which to explore the Constitutionally gray areas of free speech.</comment>While the writing aspect of the course was overall a good experience, the start of the course was a bit babying to us, and be aware that the topic is very strongly legally oriented.</comment>I LOVED the focus of this course on the First Amendment. If you are interested in law, you will really enjoy all of the essay assignments, including writing your own "legal opinion."</comment></course>HISTSCI 115: Instruments & Mechanical Marvels: The Material Culture of Science According to Simon Schaffer</title>I would tell future students that this course provides an in-depth look at numerous periods of history, the state of science at the time, and how it may have impacted future developments, through the lens of scientific instruments. Instruments provide a way to examine the broader picture, and the significance of instruments, material culture, and tacit knowledge will become clear by the end of the course. This understanding will prove applicable in fields and classes beyond just this one.</comment>Be sure to get your readings done early so you can talk about them with Professor Gauvin. The more you talk about the papers, the more they'll teach you. Also be sure to put a lot of time into the final project, it's a really cool experience!</comment>It was a great class where you learn a lot. Definitely a must-take in the Hist of Sci department before you graduate.</comment></course>OEB 153: Statistics for Biology</title>A good broad overview of statistics and a good place to start, although some experience with statistics would go a long way.</comment>This class was odd. Can't really tell how I did. The final paper is also the most stressful paper I have written.</comment>This is the only statistics class I've taken, but I couldn't imagine a better way to learn it. You shouldn't expect it to be easy, but the professors in this course are clear about what you need to learn and they're there to help you if you're having trouble.</comment>Read the textbook as well if you want to understand the materials completely.</comment>No lecture recordings/posted notes, but the textbook is great, and most lectures have corresponding chapters in the syllabus, so it is doable without going to lecture.</comment>This is the one class where success lies in extensively parsing through assigned chapters in the textbook, rather than lectures (they don't offer much, except that they point you toward what you should focus on in the textbook).  This is not a good class to take for students who haven't been exposed to statistics, or code, before; if this is you, then you will have to put in A LOT of extra work just to get by.</comment>This class introduces the mathematical concepts behind statistics and applications of statistics to biology. It also introduces R. However, I would not recommend it unless you are a very independent learner as there is very little work week to week and no practice problems provided, so you must take it upon your self to assess how well you understand concepts and find some way to prepare for the exams. For students looking to gain a basic understanding of statistics, I would recommend one of the other intro classes.</comment>Fantastic intro to statistics for people planning to conduct research in a biological field. Rigorous without being too abstract, thoroughly covers important concepts and skills for analysis of biological datasets. Learning R is fun, easy and super useful. Pace is very reasonable and problem sets/exams are a breeze if you're not intimidated by a little calculus. Instructors are very committed and really know their stuff. I enjoyed this class a lot.</comment>This course is not structured well, but it does really help with thinking about how to perform research.</comment>I strongly recommend this course to any grad students that want to gain/improve their statistical knowledge, especially if they are at the stage where they have data to analyze (and are maybe unsure of what to do with it). I left my undergrad statistics course without feeling that I really understood the reasoning behind everything we did, but this course made both theory and application quite explicit and I left feeling a lot more confident about my understanding of statistical analysis, regardless of whatever score I actually got.</comment>Sometimes the lecturers in this class take very simple topics and make them unnecessarily complicated. However, the tests are fair and both professors are really helpful and reasonable. Overall, this class gives a good introductory overview of many statistical topics, although some of them are occasionally tough to understand.</comment></course>ENGLISH 239: English Literature in the Continental Renaissance: Graduate Seminar</title>Leah is a wonderful professor! She has great enthusiasm for the subject matter, is extremely knowledgable, embraces all literary backgrounds, and picked very interesting material!</comment>It's a great chance to study some European writers you will rarely get the chance to study explicitly in an English course!</comment>This class is definitely to be taken by anyone specializing in Renaissance or even medieval literature, as it provides essential context and points of contrast for analyzing texts of the English Renaissance. It requires intensive reading and engagement, though!</comment></course>ENG-SCI 250: Information Theory</title>This subject, in some sense, is one of the most fundamental of them all. If you are fascinated about the purely mathematical limits of communication (beyond physical), this is it.</comment></course>PHYSICS 284: Strongly Correlated Systems in Atomic and Condensed Matter Physics</title>Take the class. It's easy and doesn't require that much effort, but you can learn a fair amount if you put in the effort.</comment>Lots of useful material but very difficult.</comment>A nice introduction to topics of current research. May be a bit incoherent at times but you can get a lot out of it.</comment>It's a great class. Eugene does an excellent job at presenting concepts with lots of physical motivation and minimal sophisticated maths, and also drawing connections with recent experiments. Strongly recommended if you want to do AMO/CMT.</comment></course>ECON 1490: Growth and Crisis in the World Economy</title>A fantastic course. It is a privilege to learn from Professor Jorgenson. This is a great class if you want to be able to "talk about the economy," and even politics, with others. The 5-paper format has pros and cons. You should set aside those days to do your assignments. However, the course is somewhat low stress besides those days. Also, be sure to attend section - it is VERY helpful!</comment>Be prepared to give up 10 days in the semester just writing papers for this class - those 48-hour windows are short but intense.</comment>This course's assignment structure was very difficult - be aware that you will need to devote a significant chunk of time on Tuesdays and Wednesdays to completing the writing assignments. That being said, I felt like the intensity was well worth it. Professor Jorgenson is an expert in his field, communicates some really interesting and important material on the modern world economy, and is interested in learning about you.</comment>Again, very very dry. Even if you are interested in the material.</comment>Good way to fulfill the writing requirement! Take this class to get to know Professor Jorgenson!!</comment>This course teaches a broad yet informative overview of how the different economies in the world are performing and the reasons behind them. Every econ major who want to have an intelligent conversation about economics should take this course.</comment>Take this if you're looking for a doable, qualitative economics course. Be prepared for "on weeks" and "off weeks" - when you have a unit paper (of which there are 5), be ready to spend 5-10 hours on it across 2 days, but you may not have any out-of-class work the following week. Always go to section.</comment>This is a fun and interesting class, a true application of economic concepts seen throughout the concentration. Looking for a class to teach you about today's economy and remind you why you chose economics as a concentration? Look no further, Jorgenson is a world-class economist and teacher, you won't regret taking this!</comment>Be prepared to work a lot during the writing assignments. Whilst 5 two day assignments may not seem like a lot, you almost always spend at least 1 night into the early morning hours working on it.</comment>This is a sneaky hard class, but it's very rewarding in the end!  The lectures can be dry, but pay attention and take notes because it's difficult to catch up in the 48 hours you have to write the papers.  Definitely take the time to get to know Professor Jorgenson, his wife Linda, and his assistant Trina--go to their Halloween party!  And take the time to talk to Nihar (or whoever the TF is) about your papers and how to improve on them.  The course can be discouraging at times because the papers are tough, but in the end you'll have learned a lot about some very relevant economic issues from a professor who actually meets with world leaders to solve the issues.  Take it!</comment>Take this if you are very interested in the topic, as lecture can get pretty dry at times. Professor Jorgenson is very welcoming and eager to get to know his students so don't be shy, get into his office hours. Attend the review sections! They make writing the essay much better and you will definitely get better marks.</comment>This was the BEST course I have EVER taken. If you actually do all of the reading, you will likely get an A. And you will learn a TON.</comment>This class revolves around 5 short essays that you will prepare throughout the semester. It is in your best interest to learn how to write one of these papers as soon as possible when you start the course. These are quantitatively driven papers that require facts that should be picked up on in lectures or from the readings.</comment></course>ANTHRO 1832cr: Sensory Ethnography III: Studio Course</title>An incredibly challenging class but well worth it if you are willing to put in the time and effort.</comment></course>ITAL 132: Deconstructing Rome</title>Prof. Pedriali is great and integrates a wide variety of great sources into the curriculum.</comment>This course was great in that it was trans-temporal, and did not just focus on one aspect of Rome. However, it wasn't a traditional history course, but more so a literature/film/theory course in which you deconstruct the city from a number of major themes that have persisted throughout its history. It is an awesome introduction to modern Italy, especially with Prof. Pedriali as the guiding hand, as she is an expert in the area and will make connections you wouldn't have thought of otherwise. With that being said, she allowed us to make our connections, as we presented biweekly on secondary/primary texts/movies, letting us to create our own ideas of the city and the nation. Really great class!</comment>This course is amazing- unfortunately the professor is only visiting, but it really was wonderful. You get to practice your Italian which learning a lot and analyzing many texts. Most classes are spent presenting your own summaries and ideas, which is great fun!</comment>Meets twice a week, and the courseload is pretty consistent. Seminars every 3 lectures, and lab every 3 lectures. Both of these end up becoming 10 minute presentations based on the reading/film material, to the rest of the class, in Italian.</comment></course>SOC-WORLD 21: China's Two Social Revolutions</title>This course is terribly structured. Also, the lectures are taught in a traditional lecture style. There is no powerpoint or supplementary study materials, so it is often hard to write down everything Professor Whyte says. That being said, any random term can show up on the exam, so this makes things difficult. Though the general subject matter of this course is interesting, I wouldn't recommend this course.</comment>Great way to learn about China's history and why it is the way it is today. Unsure if it will be offered since Marty is retiring, but if it is, take it!</comment>Strong interest in China required.</comment>This is the last undergraduate course taught by Professor Whyte, so this feedback may not help very much. But thinking back, I got as much out of the course that I wanted to, and I would have enjoyed the course a bit more if the grading was more lenient. The readings were interesting and the lectures were effective. In the future, if there is a version of this course taught by a different professor, I would say definitely take the class if you have an interest in the material. In the mean time, thank you, Marty Whyte.</comment>Lectures are a bit boring, but readings very interesting and really give a depth to class material.</comment>He's retiring, don't know if they're bringing the class back in some other form. If they are it's definitely worth taking.</comment>Do not take it, poorly structured with a Professor that doesn't try very hard to be approachable or prepare materials.</comment>It's an alright course.</comment>The course is really interesting, but the exams don't really correlate with the readings.  The exams are also very hard.</comment>A class that focuses on sociological and economic developments in China from the Mao-era to the present. A great course for anyone interested in learning more about China's development since 1949. Prof. Whyte is retiring, so it is difficult to say what future iterations or equivalents of SW-21 will look like. This year, it was 1 midterm, 1 final paper, 1 final exam, and relaxed section discussions. Lectures this year were 1 hour long chalk-talks that weren't recorded. Keep up with readings and you will be fine. Not too demanding in the way of time, but a genuine interest in the subject is a de facto requirement for both doing well and truly learning/taking something away from the course.</comment>This class was very little work. Given this, you'll learn a reasonable amount of work, but you won't learn as much as you would in a more rigorous class.</comment>there's a lot of hard facts to memorize and to reiterate</comment>good for a gen ed, but not the best option for societies of the world. very dry class</comment>The material that this class covers is great, but Prof. Whyte is not a good lecturer. He doesn't show any care for students and can be very harsh and brief in communication. Expectations are uncommunicated and too high sometimes. Unfortunately, that really colored my experience of the class even though the topic was interesting to me.</comment>Do the readings. Talk to someone who's taken the class before if you can. They don't make it clear as to what terms will be tested on later. You kinda just have to listen, take notes and hope for the best. Unfortunately, Marty is retiring. He was an awesome professor. L.T. was also one of my best section leaders EVER! He's chill, honest and fun to discuss things with.</comment>This course was an amazing way to get to know more about a country that is highly relevant in real life. It was also fairly easy, as long as you attend lecture every week, and the material is highly engaging.</comment>It's not being offered</comment></course>VES 106: Artist as Typographer (Seminar)</title>It's a great course. More people should (have) take(n) it</comment>Prof. McDonough has a masterful command over this material and is a pleasure to work with.</comment></course>CZCH A: Elementary Czech</title>Extremely light workload, 5 short essays in the semester and a unit test at the end of every chapter. Very easy to get an A</comment></course>STAT 315: High Dimensional Causal Inference</title>Take this course if you have a basic understanding of causal inference.</comment></course>STAT 100: Introduction to Quantitative Methods for the Social Sciences and Humanities</title>Too much emphasis on learning R. There are other programs with just as much utility like Stata that will frustrate you much less.</comment>Take this class instead of STAT 104. The professor is incredibly understanding, and learning R is really useful and not that hard. I love the way R is integrated in this course, in which it's not much pressure to really learn how to code but find the usefulness of it beyond the course. I also really like the pace of this course, which is much more slow and drawn out, especially for a non-math/stat person like me. It's not that hard if you put the work into it, and I recommend going to section even if it's optional.</comment>This class is better than Stat 104. We use a computer package that is more relevant than Stata in the current world. Plus it focuses on the most important concepts one would need to pursue further studies in Statistics, say by taking Stat 139.</comment>I've heard that this course is being removed, and that's definitely for the best. There are no redeeming aspects to this course.</comment>If you cannot code or find coding extremely difficult and tedious, do not take this course. If you are looking for a statistics course that will teach you primarily mathematical statistical analysis, do not take this course. Take this course if you want to learn tools for survey analysis and data crunching -- through coding. Coding. Coding. Coding. I can't say this enough: enter with a coding background or a willingness to focus extensively on coding for the entire semester. Don't let the first two weeks deceive you. This class will eat up your semester if you aren't comfortable. With. Coding..... Coding. I will say it again. Coding.</comment>Go to class, read/skim the textbook, and use the homework to solidify concepts (and try to start it early :P ). It's not a super difficult class, although it does require a bit of time when you have your homework assignments.</comment>do the R tutorials</comment>The class is a fairly good introduction to statistics, but the lectures are a bit disorganized and did not generate much enthusiasm for the topic. Having never taken statistics before, I felt like I learned a fair amount, but I question whether someone looking to take an intro course should not consider this one and just enroll in 104</comment>The class can be a bit challenging if you don't have a background in R, but you will soon catch up and be writing code in no time! In fact, it's pretty darn empowering!</comment>Easy class</comment>This course will prepare you to work in an environment where data is generated (which is everywhere!).  You will learn how to look at data in many different contexts.</comment></course>EXPOS 20.047: Darwinian Dating</title>This class is amazing! Probably one of the best expos classes out there.</comment>One of the best expos classes. It was actually interesting and I learned a lot about the subject matter ;)</comment>Objectively one of the best expos classes. Expos is going to be tough regardless of what class you're in, it's just a lot of writing. But Darwinian Dating makes it a fun experience.</comment>This Expos is class is one of the most popular Expos classes - many people rank it as their first choice and few get it. If you're lotteried in, consider yourself lucky!</comment>The readings are super interesting but when writing the essays it is very hard for your opinion not to come into play. When that is the case, you aren't able to express it in your paper unless you can find evidence to support the claim.</comment>This is definitely one of the most interesting Expos courses, and Dr. Krakauer is super nice. She is always willing to help you outside of class!</comment>It is a science writing class--very different from most english writing classes.  You do not read books or write normal english essays.</comment>Dr. Krakauer is very helpful and really talks through your essay with you. This is coming from someone who gets very stressed writing papers. She really is willing to guide you every step of the way as much as you need.</comment>The course does live up to the hype in terms of the quality of the material. Dr. Krakauer is very good at facilitating really fun and interesting classes in section, and it really does help to have read the readings beforehand, although if you haven't, the discussion is not too technical that you would feel incapable of contributing. One thing of note is that this is NOT an easy course - do not expect to put in minimal effort and get an A. In terms of Expos classes, I would say this falls somewhere in the middle in terms of difficulty of grading.</comment>It is a lot of work, but overall it is manageable and helps your writing develop.</comment>The topic may seem very interesting but overall, because of the nature of the class, you might not get too much into what the meat of the subject is.</comment>You will have more fun than in most other expos 20 classes</comment></course>ENGLISH 68: Migrations: American Immigrant Literature</title>Excellent Class. Prof Carpi is wonderful at leading discussions and keeping students engaged. The syllabus is great, and the assignments are totally fair. Hugely recommend.</comment>I feel like this course should be almost a requirement for any person who is interested in the way that people represent themselves in the English language. This is not just a class for someone who is familiar with the immigrant experience or someone who wants to learn about migratory narrative; this course is also about expression in general, and how humans use language to convey mind-boggling and wondrous experiences.</comment>Prof. Carpio is an AMAZING professor. You must take at least one course with her before you graduate. This course is particularly interesting as it moves into contemporary literature and creates a cohesive narrative that connects the texts. It also introduces provocative questions like What is immigrant literature? Is this genre category productive? Don't expect to just sit passively in class. This course encourages participation and engagement.</comment>Professor Carpio is very enthusiastic about her work and cares about what her students write and think. I have never had a professor who both reads our response papers and even brings some of them up in class. She listens to different perspectives and acknowledges when new ideas are brought to the table. I also really appreciated the flexibility of the final paper in this course. Students could write on any topic and could even write a creative story that grappled with ideas in the course. Because I was excited about the creative paper, I felt that I learned a lot about the genre.</comment>This class is absolutely amazing. Professor Carpio is a brilliant and funny lecturer, Janet is very helpful and friendly, and the books are great. If you have the chance, take it!</comment>I would caution them that you have to have the time to read one, if not two, novels a week and write weekly response papers. It's definitely a time commitment!</comment>Professor Carpio is incredible. She is able to make a somewhat larger class feel like a seminar, and to direct the conversation in a way that encourages student participation without impeding her ability to give a comprehensive and structured lecture. I enjoyed some of the books on the syllabus much more than others, but overall the syllabus is fantastic. This is the way to fulfill Migrations! Take this class!</comment>Do the readings. You get out of it what you put into it.</comment>A wonderfully composed class with material you should read regardless of concentration requirements. Professor Carpio truly knows how to facilitate discussion; I've never seen such powerhouse conversations in the Kresge Room. The class covers questions of craft, critical reception, canon formation, all while still managing to remain firmly grounded in the world of the novels. Can you possibly ask for more? I know many people outside of the English concentration who wanted to take this class, and continued to ask after it throughout the semester. It's a brilliant course, and if you're lucky enough to get in, absolutely take it. Don't question it for one second.</comment>Professor Carpio is a wonderful human being, and you should seize the opportunity to take any class with her, if only for the excuse to talk with her one-on-one at office hours. At times, the larger discussion format can feel impersonal and monotonous, as weeks will go by where certain students monopolize the conversation. But that shouldn't deter you from taking a class with her, because the insights you'll gain by the end of the semester (while writing some fun assignments) make up for it.</comment>Professor Carpio's amazing, and the literature's pretty good. You're probably not going to find a better Migrations course than this!</comment>Professor Carpio is an awesome person to learn from, but this class needs to be adjusted. I think there were a lot of awesome books on the syllabus for this class, but there was far too much reading for the time frame given. Essentially, with response papers due on the Monday before classes, we were basically expected to read the entire book before that Monday (with our last class being on the Thursday of the previous week) so we could write the response papers, but prompts weren't given to us until about a day before on Sunday... This is a problem that occurs in a lot of english classes, where the class essentially functions like a seminar (a collaborative lecture style with much back-and-forth discussion, lots of reading) but since it is much larger, so it ends up only being engaging to about twelve or so people on any given day. I just think that everyone in the class could benefit a lot more from a smaller syllabus, since that means less reading that everyone has to balance with their other three classes. Just know that if you end up taking this class and you find yourself constantly feeling like you're falling behind/need to catch up, you're not alone.</comment>This is a reading list not to miss. Carpio is incredibly kind and an excellent facilitator. Brilliant too.</comment>This is a wonderful class with an amazing teacher. Professor Carpio is always encouraging you to think in complex ways about the books you read and to relate them back to the canon of which they are a part. She's also kind, understanding, and very reasonable. It is easy to tell that she cares about her students.</comment>Professor Carpio is an extraordinarily kind teacher. The class is more like a seminar than most of the English common grounds courses, which is great if you are with interesting and hard-working students. The class made me think about the uneasy ethics and politics of literature and genre-classification, which was valuable for me as an English major, as someone who can take storytelling and naming for granted as a good thing. Not so difficult, but a whole lot of reading, and very possible to get very behind.</comment>This course was absolutely amazing. Prof Carpio is a stellar lecturer/discussion facilitator, and knows the field of immigrant literature extraordinarily well. 

The other members of the class were also extraordinary; I believe only junior and senior English concentrators were in it, so we had an extremely high level of discussion throughout. I learned a ton from my peers this semester. 

Assignments were very well-designed; the response papers were very reasonable for the first 6-8 weeks or so, and then the essay came at a very nice time, I feel. 

Syllabus is jaw-droppingly stellar. I wasn't a huge fan of the first 2 works, but afterwards all the works were excellent. I was a particular fan of Rolvaag, Roth, and Diaz.</comment>Professor Carpio is an amazing professor and assigns fantastic books!! Take this course!!!!!!!!</comment>Do the reading</comment>If Professor Carpio is teaching this class - if she is teaching any class - and you are free, sign up for it. Or at least shop it. She can do no wrong, and there is at least ONE book on this syllabus you have been meaning to read.</comment>Wonderful way to diversify your class readings away from old white guys and fulfill "Migrations." This class pairs an all-star reading list (spanning from the 1800's to Junot Diaz) with the enthusiastic, engaging, and thought-provoking discussions of Professor Carpio. Response papers give much room for creativity and personal interest, and Carpio, a must-have professor, gives wonderful, constructive help on the second draft of your (single!) term paper.</comment></course>FRSEMR 26u: What is Mental Illness?</title>Make sure you have an honest interest in learning about mental illnesses and disorders. If you do, then you should find this seminar to be fascinating, especially with Dr. Kahn sharing his vast knowledge of the material.</comment>If you are at all interested in or curious about the subject matter, then you will truly enjoy and even look forward to this class each week. The course readings were excellent and always interesting. The patient interviews were unforgettable.</comment>Well just as a logistical note, classes meet in Longwood, not at Harvard. Transportation is free, but understand that you'll be leaving Harvard at around 2:15 and getting back around 5:30. It's definitely worth it, though. You get a lot out of the class without having to stress about it. The workload is extremely light but the course material is still very interesting. It's a class about the experience of mental illness, so expect a lot of patient interviews and the like. Don't go in there expecting a course on the science of mental illness or to learn about neurotransmitters or new drugs or anything like that-- that's not really what the course is about. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone, though-- it really changes your perception.</comment>Ask questions! Professor Kahn knows a lot and is willing to share his knowledge!</comment>Dr. Kahn is an incredible professor and if you're at all interested in the subject matter, you'll love this class. The course offers a rare balance of really competent peers and instructors with a relaxed atmosphere. The location is slightly inconvenient, but you can always do work or bond with your classmates on the bus. I would absolutely recommend this course.</comment>If you want to be a psychiatrist you should seriously consider taking the course</comment>This is a very fun class if you are interested in psychology. Even if you aren't, you should be able to learn quite a bit from this class.</comment></course>EXPOS 40: Public Speaking Practicum</title>This was, hands down, the best class I've taken at Harvard. As a senior, I haven't felt so connected to a group of students, as I have in Expos 40. Margie and David create an amazing atmosphere that really fosters growth and understanding. Public speaking is a skill that everyone should invest time into and it is a great opportunity to get to know peers at Harvard that you otherwise would never take the time to get to know. TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU GET THE CHANCE!</comment>This course gives you a real life skill and you learn things that you will apply in everyday life.</comment>Expos 40 is just a must-take class before you graduate. The bonds you form with your classmates, and with Margie and David, through this class are just incredible. This is what every Harvard class should be like.</comment>As a former debater, I have always thought of myself as a strong speaker. Boy, was I wrong. This class made me conscious of all my problematic verbal tics, distracting hand gestures, confusing presentation flow, etc. etc. etc. Everyone could benefit from this class. And surprisingly, the readings are really awesome and supplement the class discussion in a real way that's unlike in other classes. Do the readings and you'll benefit!</comment>EXPOS 40 is everything it's hyped up to be and more. Everyone, no matter their level of comfort/skill, has a lot to gain from this class. Definitely take it if you are lucky enough to be selected!</comment>Expos 40 is one of those classes you MUST have heard about from someone. And maybe you don't see what the fuss is about but trust, the fuss is there because of a reason: this class will change you. And not just in the sense of making you a better public speaker and making you more aware of what goes into being a good public speaker. The class creates a community of peers and professors who support, teach, and help each other. It is worth trying to get into this class every single semester until you do. Margie and David are so thoughtful and amazing at what they do that I always always looked forward to class.</comment>The community of peers that you get to work with, and the support, is unmatched! I wish more classes at Harvard reflected the philosophy of teaching and level of reflection that this class allows!</comment>Expos 40 is an absolutely amazing class and if you get in, you must take it!! Margie and David create such a supportive environment where you really feel like you can try anything out, and they really want you to get the most out of it that you can. Utilize the PSTs early and often, and practice your speech to other people, not just in front of a mirror. Expos 40 doesn't only improve your public speaking skills, it helps you out in all aspects in life--makes you better at giving feedback, listening, and interviewing. Take this class if you can!</comment>Take this class if you want to improve your ability to speak publicly, no matter what level you are on. You could be one who fears public speaking, or you could be a confidant speaker. No matter what level you are on, the teachers will meet you there and help you improve.</comment>Take this class. It is unlike any other class at Harvard.</comment>APPLY! APPLY! APPLY! Expos 40 is a gem. It gave me a community of 29 other students that saw me grow as a speaker and as a person. Margie and David are so approachable and you can see how proud they are of your progress from your first speech to your last. With the coaching I've received in class, I've been able to take what I've learned and help my roommates and friends prepare for class presentations.</comment>This is probably going to be your favorite class ever if you end up getting in. It really is a special experience.</comment>This is class in INCREDIBLE! Definitely lottery it for every semester until you get in. Margie and David create a supportive, constructive classroom environment where you will have the opportunity to get to know everyone in the class personally and grow immensely as a public speaker. The skills learned in this class are applicable to every aspect of your life and honestly I think Harvard should make this course a required course for graduation. Such a great experience!</comment>Amazing class. You develop a great relationship with those in your section. Margie and David are great at coaching and offering advice (although I wanted more of this!). Beyond this, I think these two are incredibly supportive and invested in the development of their students. Overall, the class makes public speaking a lot more approachable, particularly with planned speeches, but also a bit with impromptu speaking as well. I feel a lot better equipped to identify effective components of a speech, as well as pinpointing what is effective (and ineffective) for me personally. I feel like I have the toolbox to continue to improve my public speaking in the future. One of the best classes I've taken at Harvard.</comment>Keep applying for Expos 40 until you get in, and apply as many semesters as you can.  I can say with certainty that this will be the most useful class I will take at Harvard.  The structure of the course is so well-suited for learning - I know I will remember the tips and tricks from this course many years from now.  Margie and David are two of Harvard's finest teachers, and over the course of the semester, the class really becomes a community, which is something I haven't experienced in any other class.</comment>Take this course if you can! Margie and Dave are extremely caring, and the other students in the course will teach you an incredible amount. Make sure to take advantage of the time spent in class: do the exercises as well as you can, fully participate in class discussions, and put into practice the techniques that you learn in theory! I think one of the most important things you learn in this class is how to critique other people's speeches - acknowledging what is done well and not-so-well is perhaps just as important as knowing how to speak well.</comment>If you have the opportunity to take this course, do it. I have not learned more about the experiences, beliefs, and passions of my classmates in any other class I've taken at Harvard. The course helped me step out of my comfort zone, and identified both positive and negative aspects of my public speaking abilities.</comment>Everyone MUST take Expos40 before they graduate! The class is literally life-changing. This class doesn't just improve your public speaking skills, but also, you will likely learn more from listening to your peers' speeches than you will giving yours. The class truly reminded me of why I love Harvard.</comment>Margie and David are great! I have become a better speaker because of this class. Take it if you can!</comment>By far the best class I've ever taken at Harvard. It's a rare combination where you have a ton of fun but also learn a lot. I also felt really inspired from getting to know my classmates and seeing their progress.</comment></course>VES 250r: The Live Film: Graduate Production Course</title>A great opportunity to work on individual projects and receive feedback from both faculty and peers.</comment></course>FRSEMR 38o: The Evolution of Latino/a Culture: Analyzing the Interplay Between Stereotypes and Self-Definition</title>This class is an excellent freshman seminar. The pace is great; the materials are interesting. Readings are usually short, and most of the material are movies or documentaries. The topic does not get boring if you stay engaged in the discussion. The only coursework is a group "provocation," an individual presentation, and a group project. These assignments are flexible and allow you to talk about anything you are interested in that is related to the course. This flexibility makes the assignments fairly easy. Considering Harvard's lack of Latino studies classes, this seminar is a valuable and rare experience to discuss Latino culture in an academic context. Definitely take advantage of this opportunity.</comment>Without a doubt thought-provoking and insightful into not just how Latina and Latino stereotypes play out but also how other minority stereotypes have come to be. Strongly recommend if you want to engage with a group of people and with a professor.</comment>The seminar is a set of enriching discussions on different aspects of Latino culture in the United States, and I would definitely take it again.</comment>The class was great! We watched a lot of great movies, read interesting articles, and had really productive conversations.</comment></course>BPH 301: Biological Sciences Seminars</title>Reading the papers beforehand would be helpful in order to best follow the presentations</comment></course>VIETNAM 130a: Advanced Vietnamese</title>Vietnamese 130a essentially picks up where you left off in 120b. The chapters in the textbook remain consistent in structure but the narratives and vocab do progressively become a bit harder. Because of the small class size though, you get individualized help along the way, and you also have class time to learn more about Vietnamese culture and history.</comment></course>ISLAMCIV 171: Religion and Political Violence in North Africa and the Sahel</title>Professor Kane is fascinating, the subject material is interesting, it is not typical of what is covered at Harvard. Do the class.</comment>While discussions and material are good, be aware the professor likes to go in depth in reviewing material</comment>Excellent coverage of the discourse.</comment></course>SOCIOL 98Ka: Arts, Culture, and Urban Neighborhoods</title>Dear everyone,  If you do not know Matt Kaliner, then you are missing out on an amazing professor, course, and hilarious office hours. Honestly, look him up right now. Realize that he is the BEST. Send him an email just saying that you saw his Arts, Culture, and Urban Neighborhoods course and that you want to hear more about it. I am sure that his response will make you smile, laugh, and want to take the tutorial. Okay, but beyond just the course instructor (which is A VERY IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF A STRONG COURSE), the course material + assignments were super cool. For one of the assignments, all of the class went to an art crawl in SoWa Boston. Who even knew there was a SoWa part of Boston? I've lived here for years and I learned so many new things about Boston. For another assignment, you interview a local musician. IN WHAT OTHER CLASS WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO INTERVIEW COOL AF MUSICIANS?   Please, my fingers are tired. Just take this class and you'll never regret it. Believe me. I used to hate classes. And then 98ka happened!!! :) #blessed  Sincerely, me</comment>Really fun junior tutorial. You'll learn a lot with out being super stressed. Matt is the most accessible professor ever and will help you make the most out of the class. The class can sometimes be a bit unorganized so if you are someone who demands a lot of structure this might not be the class for you</comment>This class was an unexpectedly enjoyable junior tutorial thanks to Professor Kaliner's flexible approach to discussion and assignments. He tailored the class to our interests, and allowed the readings to reflect these changes. The assignments are interview and research based, and the feedback on drafts really helps. A painless way to</comment>I don't think i can put into words how much i enjoyed this class, i looked forward to our meeting every week. Matt is incredible, take every class you can with him, he has a genuine enthusiasm not only about the topics being discusses but in each of the students. if you are interested at al in art, culture, and boston, i Highly recommend this class</comment>I'd recommend it based off Matt's enthusiasm for the subject! For some reason when I filled out my junior tutorial rankings I thought that the title of the class was using "urban" as code word for "black" so I was taking it thinking we'd be looking at culture of the African diaspora or something. It's not about that at all haha it's about urban as in cities and arts as in museums and culture and nightlife as in clubbing. Still interesting!</comment></course>ECON 2810a: Labor Market Analysis</title>Labor teaches necessary methodology and topics very relevant to current research frontier</comment>I would particularly recommend the course for the breadth of issues addressed, the variety of modern empirical methods covered, and the opportunity to refine research ideas in progress with Prof Katz and Alexandra.</comment>This is a doctoral seminar. Taking this course on a lark without knowing what you want to get out of it would probably be a mistake - there is just too much to absorb all of it (for most people). For a really motivated senior it could be a good way to get a feel for what doctoral level work in econ is like.</comment>Great survey course of labor economics, with a focus on empirical research</comment>Good overview of labor economics</comment></course>ECON 1723: Capital Markets</title>This course isn't trivial, but it is very rewarding if your are interested in academic finance  Don't take this class if you just need to get ready fro recruiting- it isn't worth it, you should have some genuine interest in the material to get by</comment>This class thoroughly works through many interesting and real-world-relevant problems related to financial economics. It helps students understand what options are and how to price them, what the efficient markets hypothesis really says, and how to compare theory with evidence. The class is well-organized.</comment>Interesting topic though the lecture may not be that interesting. Exams really expect you to know a lot.</comment>Easier if you know statistics and have sounds quantitative background. To do well in this class requires more of a quantitative background than an actual background in finance.</comment>Must be willing to put in time and effort into understanding the material - not hard, but not straightforward either.</comment>This class is a good introduction to important financial topics.</comment>Well this class was interesting. And by interesting I mean a nightmare. As a reference, my old friend that took this class, who had over a 3.9 GPA, said this was the worst class he ever took and did the worst in. Its a very poorly taught class, and the exams this year were a nightmare. The first midterm was essentially the 2006 midterm, and about half the class studied it on the old course website. I unfortunately wasn't one of those people. And then on the second midterm he put on questions that were completely unlike all the other exams and unlike everything we learned. The average was a 45. I have never regretted taking a class more in my life.</comment>It is a very interesting class that you will learn a lot of cool material about if you have any interest in finance. It was helpful for interviews for more quantitative finance firms, and is not very time consuming or boring. The class overlaps decently with Stat 123, so for those who have taken that before it will partially a review, often in less mathematic detail.</comment>This course is called Capital Markets.</comment>I think my opinion of the class is unfortunately heavily biased by a midterm that felt really unfair and a few bad TF interactions, but other than that I thought the course material was interesting and Prof. Campbell was a good lecturer.</comment>great class, just really hard</comment>The class is excellent. Not only is John Campbell a very engaging professor who is clearly an expert in his field, but the homeworks and exams are sufficiently challenging without being overboard. The class forces you to think and engage with the material at a high level and does not attempt to coddle you through any of the concepts.</comment>Homework and tests are hard but material is very interesting and useful.</comment>Good class. Be comfortable with your math background. Definitely geared toward people who have taken 1011a an 1011b.</comment>Great class. You will learn very much and cover an incredible range of contents. Exams are demanding, but doable. Prof. Campbell is very nice and always helpful. Make sure you go to a good TFs for section.</comment>GREAT CLASS!  Pretty hard for non-math Ec people, not too bad for mathy-ec people.  Good lecture, great range of materials.  Definitely an academic perspective on finance, but one that is good to have regardless of whether you plan to go into the field.  Great lectures and a manageable workload if you go to section and do the PSets well.</comment>Not a bad class if you are interested in capital markets. Problem sets ridiculously easy, but the exam material is often subject to change.</comment>John Campbell is a smart guy but this course seems a bit unmotivated and dry. The lecture material takes at most half an hour to read through and understand (compared to 1.5 hours for lecture). Tests are much harder than expected although everyone does relatively poorly and only gets half of the questions correct. Definitely a much lighter version of Ec 1011a but with the same grading distribution. Also, go to class because they use Learning Catalytics now</comment>It is extremely hard.</comment>Professor Campbell is a legend in this field. This was one of the most satisfying courses I've taken at Harvard. Overall great!</comment>This class is so hard and the TFs are the most unhelpful I have ever had.</comment>Only take this class if you are super into finance! If you are, then Prof. Campbell is very knowledgable and the material is great. Be sure to try to keep up with course material also; makes it a much better experience.</comment>Great course. John Campbell is really nice and gives engaging and interesting lectures. Problem sets are definitely doable, though exams can be a little tricky (but the curve is generous). Don't buy the Bodie Kane and Marcus textbook; it's an expensive book and I only opened it three times this semester. Save the $$$ - it's one of the more regrettable poor investment strategies I learned about from this class.</comment>Be prepared to face very hard exams that exhibit only little relation to the lectures.</comment>I really enjoyed this course a lot more than I thought I would. Although the material can sometimes be a bit dry, the class does a good job of making things pretty interesting. It's a well-organized, well-planned course, which also makes it easier to get into things. I feel like I learned a lot.</comment>learned a lot!  was interesting and not very quantitative - definitely doable.</comment></comment>Campbell is an amazing teacher. Material is challenging and you need to pay close attention to every lecture. Absolutely necessary for anyone considering a career in finance.</comment>While this course is extremely difficult and does take a fair amount of time, it has been so interesting and has actually helped with financial interviews.</comment>It's a good course if you really want to understand the way academic finance works.</comment>Take it if you are interested in a quantitative approach to financial markets. it's worth the effort.</comment>A fantastic professor teaching interesting material whether or not you're pursuing finance in the future.</comment>The lectures are very interesting and the course gives a decent overview of financial markets as well as finance in general. Unfortunately, the midterms (especially the second one) were very technical and only partially tested the learned materials. The final on the other hand was very fair.</comment>Great introduction to capital markets. Campbell is great.</comment>Not worth the time...</comment>This is a good class. If you have some finance background, like I did, this will help improve your understanding and make you think more about some topics you never thought of previously. If you don't have any finance background, this will give you a good introduction to some things that people think about (but it's not nearly everything). As a side note, the class has many of the smarter econ students in it.</comment>Very interesting course. I found the subject matter to be great, and the syllabus is really a comprehensive list of topics extremely relevant to anyone interested in or considering a career in finance/hedge funds/etc. The exams were difficult though, and sometimes the questions did not mesh exactly with what was gone over in lecture. Also, the TFs were ok but not always that helpful, especially with logistical issues.</comment>Even though it was pretty difficult, this was probably my favorite economics class.  If you're at all interested in finance, take this class and take it seriously.  Put the work in, and you'll come out knowing a lot about how capital markets work.</comment>Not a crazy workload but the exams are HARD. If you think you want to take this class be prepared to study your ass off</comment>Prepare to be consistently frustrated with every test you take. The feeling of failure and uncertainty is very common throughout the entire course. Time and effort is reflected minimally.</comment>Capital Markets was an amazing course one of the best I have taken at Harvard. Very interesting and applicable material. Not too much work, especially as an Applied Math/Econ major it was one of my easier courses. Problem sets don't take too much time and exams are fair. Lectures are great.</comment>There's some really good stuff in the class but it's way too mathematical to be immediately digestible...Professor Campbell is an excellent lecturer and if academic finance interests you then take the class. If you just want to work in finance and learn something practical for that purpose, this isn't the best class for you.</comment>If you are looking to take this because you want to learn about the world of finance, do not. It does little to help you in that regard.</comment>Interesting introduction to asset pricing...first month of the course focuses too heavily on CAPM and efficient markets hypothesis, but the latter half is worth the wait. Maybe the easiest course I've taken (Gen Eds included) but does require some de minimus background in statistics (expected value, covariance, etc.). Incredibly forgiving curve, given that the exams aren't particularly difficult to begin with.</comment>For Applied Math-Econ concentrators, this course is not necessarily difficult by any means, there's just a lot of material to learn. The problem sets, although weekly, only have a few problems each, so it's really up to you to keep up with the material.</comment>It's a mix of the material covered in stat 123 and ec 1745, and the difficulty is somewhere in between the two as well. Great course for real life examples of financial concepts.</comment>Campbell is the man. Take this course for him. He is a really engaging lecturer and teaches the basics of finance really well. The one major flaw of this course is that the lectures are a mile wide and an inch deep, but the tests are really detailed and computation-focuses. The second midterm was basically impossible, but the final was a lot more fair.</comment>If you are very interested in the content and expect to spend a lot of time on it, then go for it. It is hard, somewhat rewarding, and very theoretical.</comment>The course is challenging but it is also a rewarding learning experience.</comment>a</comment>Capital markets is a great class which will teach you a lot. In addition, it does a great job of balancing the mathematics behind the theories and qualitative concepts.</comment>This is challenging course, I didn't understand anything that was said in class and the psets always stumped me and the midterms feel impossible. That being said, I've come away with a little bit better understanding of financial institutions that hopefully will provide good returns somewhere down the line in an interview or reading an econ article or when I'm someday investing for retirement. So all in all, the class is a good investment, but get ready to invest a lot.</comment>In a class where the midterms and final consisted of such a large percentage of the grade, one would have thought that the teaching staff might have taken more time developing the first two midterms. The second midterm in particular was very demanding.</comment>John Campbell is an excellent lecturer, and this course is an excellent and rigorous introduction to modern finance that will be very elucidating, whether you plan to seek an internship in the field of finance or take an academic interest in the subject.</comment>Great course that teaches you things you won't get out of a substitute course.</comment></course>JAPAN Ba: Elementary Japanese</title>If you are willing to put time and effort into this class, it will be incredibly rewarding and fun. This class provides a fast paced and fascinating introduction to Japanese. the professors are extremely encouraging and the class is very well organized.</comment>Very rewarding, Japanese is awesome!</comment>This class is wonderful! The language is amazing on its own, but the way Kageyama sensei teaches makes it so much better. While it may seem hard at first, it will get more manageable. Just be sure to participate in class, don't be afraid to speak up. Making mistakes is a huge part of learning and they understand this. The drill sections are also incredibly helpful because they make you speak in Japanese. This seem intimidating, but its extremely helpful in developing fluency.</comment>Make sure to memorize vocabulary early, and practice it often, as it does not go away.</comment>This is a fantastic introduction to Japanese, and you'll be surprised at how much you learn in just one semester. The teachers are all very dedicated and patient. I would recommend this class without reservation if you're at all interested in learning Japanese.</comment>There's a fair amount of busywork. It's not a uniquely wonderful class, but it's solid, and it isn't devastatingly difficult. As with all language classes, if you want to learn the language - go for it!</comment>Great language introductory course, worth taking whether interested in Japan or not to begin with.</comment>It's hard but worthwhile. You come out with a surprising amount of Japanese language knowledge.</comment>Japanese is not well taught at Harvard. Take another language.</comment>This is a great opportunity, and apanese is a very fun and satisfying kanguage.</comment>Japanese is an incredibly fun and beautiful language to learn and you will see yourself make an incredible amount of progress throughout this course.  The program is excellent and you will find yourself a part of an amazing community that you never knew existed.</comment>Kageyama sensei is the best</comment>It's a great class with fantastic teachers, but it is incredibly fast paced. While you will learn a lot and have a lot of fun, they should learn rudimentary Japanese before hand.It will make the class much easier.</comment>They want you to learn the language and are always willing to help. You can really learn a lot if you put the work into it.</comment>I really enjoyed this class - I felt like my teachers were dedicated to helping us learn, and I made some really great friends too!</comment>Japanese Ba may be one of the best courses at Harvard. Kageyama-sensei and the drill instructor are great at explaining the language, and you will definitely have enough support to learn the material. There is so much that you learn, that you will actually be surprised by how much Japanese you will know by the end of the semester!</comment>It's a great class to learn a new language. The TFs are wonderful, and Kageyama sensee is great as well. I really enjoyed the class.</comment>If you have any interest in learning Japanese, I highly suggest you do it here. The teaching staff is amazing and infinitely available outside of class for extra help. There is class and homework every day, and on average, 2 short quizzes per week, but don't let this daunt you! You likely won't need to spend much more than 5-6 hours per week outside of class on this course. If you put in the effort to prepare for class every day, you'll do very well, and likely come out with an understanding of Japanese language and culture that surprises you.</comment>It's a good class.</comment>If you would like to learn a new language, and are prepared to spend a lot of time on it, I would definitely recommend this course. Although it was probably my hardest course, I learned so much. The teachers are also wonderful.</comment>This will be the best taught class you've had at Harvard. I cannot be more grateful to the dedication of the senseis in all that they do. You'll learn so much so quickly, and retain it very very well! Use the senseis as resources because they'll make themselves consistently available to help you in any way you need. The class feels like a community where you're all learning as a team, which has brought me great friends along the way too. TAKE THIS CLASS!</comment>this class is really great</comment>Really fun and fast class that has a steady workload</comment>i have already told them: do it, but be prepared.</comment>I think that you will sincerely regret not taking Japanese Ba if you are considering it. I have taken another East Asian Language before (Chinese my freshman year) and comparing Japanese class to Chinese class, I find Japanese to be very well organized and very accessible. I found Kageyama-sensei to be a sincere and genuine teacher who was willing to help her students succeed any way she saw possible. She is a talented preceptor and I think the two TFs were amazing as well. The whole team is so friendly and kind. You get so much out of this class as well, I have learned so much writing, speaking, listening, and reading skills that I am genuinely excited to take Japanese Bb next year and for the years following.

Definitely consider taking it!</comment>This class is awesome. If you're choosing among several languages to pursue, and you're remotely interested in Japanese, I strongly suggest checking out the course in shopping period and most likely you'll end up taking it. Incredibly well-organized and dedicated professor and instructors.</comment></course>RELIGION 13: Scriptures and Classics</title>You get to cover an incredible amount of information with a very knowledgable professor who gives great lectures. Course is very well organized, and the assignments are helpful without being incredibly time consuming.</comment>I have never taken a religion course before and now wish I had enough time left to get a secondary. This was an incredible course with a very knowledgeable teaching staff interested in you and the subject matter. I felt like I got a fantastic introduction to the world's most seminal religious texts, and learned how many of our "classics" can be read in a religious light.</comment>This is a great course if you are interested in getting a grasp of many of the great world religions. In our ever increasing world, it is important to understand the faiths that drive many people, and the best way to do that is by reading what their scriptures say. However, the texts are hard, and often long, and there is a lot of secondary material you should be reading. If you are already in heavy reading courses, this class might be too much. You should be prepared to spend many hours reading if you really want to get the most out of the class.</comment>Each week you will be asked to read either excerpts or the entirety of a "scripture" or a "classic." The readings can be long, but if you are interested in the material it is worth it. Additionally, Graham's lectures are very informative and really help build your understanding of the texts. A great class if you are interested in reading, discussing and writing about some of the texts that have shaped peoples and societies throughout human history. Graham is also very passionate and knowledgeable in every single lecture which makes every week interesting.</comment>Take it! Not a huge time commitment and super interesting.</comment>This is an enjoyable class that truly walks you through the main tenets of each text. It's a great introductory course.</comment>Although you speed through the readings, the discussions you have in class and section are incredibly rich and offer a lot to think about, not just in an academic sense, but personally too.</comment>Religion 13 is a solid introductory course to religion.  Lectures were occasionally difficult to follow, and I would have enjoyed more background on the various religious traditions rather than just focusing on the texts, but overall, I did learn a great deal.</comment>This class is very thought-provoking and really increased my awareness of the diversity, complexity, and power of religious traditions around the world. The texts we read are fairly difficult, but if you put effort into understanding them (for me, this mostly happened in section) then they are incredible. My TF, Greg, was great at making us think about all the different themes in each one and how they might relate and shape someone's worldview. My biggest struggle with this class was in lecture-Professor Graham is funny and offers a wide range of insights into each tradition, but his lectures can be hard to follow and I often found my mind wandering. That said, you can make up for trouble understanding lecture by doing the readings each week-they cover the same material. Overall, this was a great general introduction to a range of religious traditions that gave back as much as you put into it. It is possible to get by each week with only a cursory reading of the text, but doing so would be a huge waste of an opportunity. Devoting energy to breaking down the complexities in the material is a very rewarding experience that leaves you feeling both enlightened and closer to the various cultures you study.</comment></course>FRSEMR 31n: Beauty and Christianity</title>Loved the variety of reading material and the creativity of the written assignments. The essays and class preparations were very refreshing and kept the class interesting on a week to week basis. Also Prof. Kiely is just about the friendliest, warmest person ever and I really enjoyed learning from someone who has had so much wisdom and experience in the Harvard community.</comment>This class provide a wonderful view into Christianity as represented by the arts. You begin to see Christianity's importance not only as a religion, but as a muse for artistic production.</comment>Great class discussions, excellent for personal enrichment</comment>Really do the reading, probably the best way to get something out of the class.</comment>Its a fun class.</comment>You will get the chance to read, listen to, and see some things you've never heard of; some things you always knew of but never took the time to examine firsthand; and some things you've already experienced, e.g., The Scarlet Letter, Dante. How much you benefit from each assignment depends largely on whether you actually do the reading and prepare.</comment>If you have any interest in art, christianity, or their intersection, take this course. Professor Kiely is one of the nicest people on campus and you'll look forward to your discussions.</comment>This course is a great freshman seminar. Professor Kiely is really interesting and very nice, and there are always great discussions. It's definitely not necessary to have knowledge of Christianity before the course, and this seminar focuses a lot on the artistic nature and analysis of art.</comment>Professor Kiely is extremely nice, approachable, and knowledgeable. The reading is interesting, and although it seems that there are a lot of books to read, you are often only assigned one chapter so the workload is no heavier than any other freshman seminar. Definitely a great class!!!! Take it!!!</comment></course>EXPOS 20.238: Woolf and Hemingway</title>Of course I haven't taken any of the other expository writing classes, but from what I've heard from my peers, this seems to be (one of) the best ones out there. Yes, it requires a lot of outside reading. But Professor Becker is phenomenal. The classroom environment is so encouraging and she truly values all discussion and input from students. She is welcoming with offering help, and her comments on my writing benefited me greatly. The class may be a bit more work than other expository writing classes, but overall I didn't find it to be too heavy of a work load and this was honestly my favorite class this semester.</comment>Only take this class if you are seriously interested in majoring in English</comment>It might be a difficult course for students that did not have a great expository writing program in high school. However, it was so well taught and the material is incredibly meaningful if you like reading and writing and are interested in English. Dr. Becker is excellent, thoughtful and diligent.</comment>This is an excellent class if you're interested in literature by two very influential artists (Virginia Woolf and Ernest Hemingway). However, get ready for a lot of work...possibly the most work required of any Expository Writing class. With that being said, Dr. Becker is amazing and your writing skills will surely improve under her guidance.</comment>The essays are tough, so DO NOT procrastinate and actually complete the exercises that Dr. Becker assigns! Doing the steps that precede submitting a draft will make your job so much easier.</comment>stay on top of your reading</comment>If you love literature, then this is the expos class for you. Hemingway and Woolf are incredible writers and the discussions we had about them were intriguing. However, if you want aren't interested in writing responses to literature and want an expos class that covers different genres in writing then this course is not for you.</comment>The course is reading-heavy but not necessarily on a regular basis. You spend a lot of time analyzing the novels and short stories but not much time learning how to write.</comment>It's very difficult and I found our preceptor to be very intimidating, while she obviously knew a lot.</comment>It's a GREAT Expos class - really, really interesting, and Dr. Becker is amazing.  But - go into it expecting a very English-focused course, involving lots of in-depth reading/textual analysis, and be ready to work because it is a competitive/toughly-graded course.</comment>While I would not call the course "easy" since that largely depends on high school writing preparation, it is certainly manageable, but only if you do the readings and prepare the assignments in a timely fashion. The primary materials as well as the academic articles/chapters are all interesting reads, so I recommend this section of Expos if you like the authors.</comment>This is a fantastic Expos course! If you want engaging readings, useful feedback, and interesting discussion, take this course! Dr. Becker is extremely knowledgeable and dedicates so much time and attention to her students--your writing and organization will improve drastically after taking this course. Even if literature isn't your thing, this is a great course to take. It balances out scientific and pset classes very nicely.</comment>This is a great class with a fantastic teacher. There is a fair amount of reading but, it is definitely worth the workload.</comment></course>ENGLISH 145a: Jane Austen's Fiction and Fans</title>so much fun.</comment>This class is awesome whether you are new to Austen (I was!) or if you are a Janeite. The work load is surprisingly more than it seems, but it's a lot of fun, and Professor Lynch is very approachable and helpful!</comment>This course was so enjoyable! Professor Lynch's passion really shines through, and participating is actually fun. The readings are great (Austen), and the workload relatively fair (but be prepared to read enough to get through half an Austen novel each week). Highly recommend taking this class if you're interested in Austen, and looking for a relatively chill and interesting class. Just do be aware that you read largely through the lens of Austen fans. If this doesn't sound interesting at all, know that this part of the course (roughly half of it) won't be interesting for you.</comment>This is one of the best classes I have taken at Harvard. Learning about Jane Austen with a professor as great as Prof Lynch was a great experience! You will not regret taking this class!</comment>This class is so wonderful! I would absolutely recommend it to anyone with a love for Austen's novels. This class takes you beyond conventional views of her works and teaches you to think about why her works still have such an appeal to today's readers. Professor Lynch and Rachel are fantastic, and their love for this topic makes class engaging and fun!</comment>The course is reading-heavy, but the reading is enjoyable.  We had fun movie screenings as well.  This is a great course to take, even if you are not already an Austen fan.</comment>So I went into this class as an Austen skeptic (had only read Pride and Prejudice, which I thought was good) and took it to satisfy my Early British Lit requirement for the English secondary. One semester later, I've read 5 Austen novels, some of which I thought were a little tiresome, and others of which I think are brilliant (P&P). Austen really is a master of irony and free indirect discourse, and the way she shifts between narrator and character perspectives is amazing. We received a lot of historical context for reading Austen, which really helped me appreciate Austen more! (cf the ha-ha in Mansfield Park)</comment>If you like Jane Austen (and you really should), you need to take this class. If you think you might like Jane Austen, you need to take this class. If you don't like Jane Austen, you need to take this class so you can be corrected.</comment>This course was bar none my favorite class of the semester. Professor Lynch and Rachel both had such a genuine and infectious enthusiasm for their subject, class discussions were lively and challenging, and the material was (of course) wonderful. Be aware, this isn't a light course--there is plenty of work to go around (four essays and an exam in all)--but it is a delightful one.</comment>Whether you are a fan of Austen's books or any of their modern adaptations, you should definitely take this course. Professor Lynch and Rachel are both incredibly nice people and are super enthusiastic about Austen. Section is fun because we get to fangirl over movies. Also, the fandom assignments are really fun and interesting. In what other class do you get to write fanfiction?</comment></course>WOMGEN 1211: Queer Practice</title>This class did have a lot of work(mostly readings), but I think this class is extremely useful. I really enjoyed the set-up of the class, and think Professor Meadow is a great teacher. She really helped me think about topics I was passionate about and carve a unique final project that encompassed many things I had questions about. The most transformative class I have taken at Harvard, and would highly recommend!</comment>will change you forever and make you hypercritical of everything you encounter. Get ready to have your mind blown.</comment>This is an incredibly unique course if you have the opportunity to take it. I've never experienced anything like it before at Harvard. It is personally challenging and is a chance to get to know some of your peers and a faculty member very well. You should be passionate about the subjects that are covered in this class in order to get something out of it.</comment>This course will challenge you and encourage you to mine for stories from the depths of your being. This is the most unique course I've ever taken, and the projects that have come from it are inspiring.</comment>Every queer and/or trans student at Harvard should take this course. It's transformative.</comment>This class has excellent potential for intellectual and personal enrichment. But only take it if you are willing to give yourself to the class. It's intimate and challenging, but worth it if you are willing to open yourself up.</comment>This course was my favorite class I have taken at Harvard so far. The readings and discussions were incredibly interesting and I grew very close to the class. If you are at all interested in queer issues, and are interested in looking at these issues from an intersectional approach, you will love this class.</comment></course>WOMGEN 1271: Women and War: Gender, Race, and the Politics of Militarism</title>You probably don't think gender and militarism are that related, but they are in so many fascinating ways.</comment>I will never look at the world the same because of this class.</comment>Incredible course and one of the few at Harvard that explicitly addresses the intersections of politics, militarization, war, race, gender, empire, etc. thoroughly. If we could keep Professor Mesok after this year, she would be an incredible addition to the faculty and hopefully force the Government/Social Studies department to take gender theory more seriously.</comment>This class is excellent! I'm not sure if Prof. Mesok will be back next year but if she is, you should definitely take the class. As someone without a background in WGS but with an interest in women in the military, the class definitely broadened my intellectual horizons without being overly intimidating or challenging. You get feedback on early writing assignments so you go into the big paper prepared, class discussion was excellent, and the subject matter overall is fascinating. Excellent class if you're at all interested in how gender and militarism interact</comment></course>HISTSCI 200: Knowing the World: Studying the History of Science</title>This is a fantastic introduction to and overview of the history of science. If you're a graduate student, you attend all the lectures and do the undergraduate reading, and then read roughly six extra articles per week for the graduate section, where you'll mostly discuss the historiography rather than the undergrad readings. Prof. Csiszar is a fantastic, enthusiastic, kind, accessible professor. Don't miss the chance to take a class with him.</comment>The nature of the course as a survey course makes the material somewhat fragmented or unrelated week to week, but the readings were very good and the discussions intelligent and insightful. The attention to methodological strategies and wider applicability of the works were particularly valuable.</comment>This course is a great way to cover some foundational themes in history of science. The undergraduate lectures are instructive pedagogically for someone who might one day teach this course, while the graduate section provides a great forum in which to become acquainted with key questions in the field. The reading list also contains newer texts so it allows one to read outside of what perhaps more standards lists might cover.</comment></course>FRSEMR 40i: The Supreme Court in U.S. History</title>You will understand the Supreme Court more than most of your peers by the end of this class.</comment>This course was the absolute BEST. The class discussions are so engaging and always keep you on your toes. The assigned readings are incredibly interesting and more than manageable. The response papers were honestly fun to do-- you can write however you feel and think (the SAT/UNSAT aspect really frees you and challenges you in a different way). Professor Fallon is a fantastic instructor that challenges you to be a more critical thinker, often without your realizing it. The opportunity to interact with him in a small-classroom setting is a rare and precious one (his other undergraduate course is very big). This course is "hard" not in the sense that you are up until 5 am slaving over the last paragraphs of your 30-page paper, but in the sense that you will be chewing over the questions that were raised in the class and having random "Aha!" moments in the hallways (and scaring away everyone in the process). If you are lucky enough to get into this seminar, take it. You will wish you had a course like this every semester afterward.</comment>This is by far one of the best classes I have taken in my entire life. I have always been interested in the Supreme Court, but this class has taken that interest to a whole new level. Professor Fallon is easily one of the most thoughtful, knowledgeable and downright brilliant people I have ever met. Not only is he an expert on his field, and are his insights extremely informative, but it is obvious that he cares deeply for his students. He goes out of his way to make everyone feel comfortable, accepted and important. Moreover, despite being such a highly respected scholar, he is humble, down to earth and extremely approachable. The readings were also very interesting, albeit a little long. I feel that I learned an incredible amount about the US Supreme Court in the 13 times this class met. This was by far the most rewarding experience of my freshman year, and I would recommend this to anyone who has even the most passing interest in the Supreme Court, its history, and its role in society.</comment>This is one of the best classes you can take as a Freshman and one of the best classes you will take throughout your time at Harvard. Professor Fallon is an amazing professor. He is insightful and leads the seminar discussions with both energy and grace. You will learn as much from the readings and Professor Fallon as you do from your fellow classmates so make sure to be open to the viewpoints your classmates present. The class will make you challenge your views of the law and society and will also help you to grow both intellectually and morally as an individual.</comment>Prepare for a lot of reading. However, Professor Fallon is FANTASTIC and you will learn so much. Class discussion was great. Also keep in mind that this seminar is extremely difficult to get into because of its popularity, so definitely put thought and effort into the application if it's something you are passionate about.</comment>Be willing to read a lot if you want to truly get something out of the class. That said, Professor Fallon is a wonderful professor and both flexible and understanding of what it's like to be a student.</comment>Professor Fallon is wonderful, and the discussions were always fascinating.</comment>I am so glad I took this seminar! It changed the way I look at the Supreme Court today. Richard Fallon is so nice and he really made this seminar worthwhile. He really lets the students take control of the seminar and we are always the main ones speaking. You will learn a alot from the readings, Professor Fallon, and the other students. I highly suggest taking this course, but remember there is a quite a good amount of reading.</comment>This class is truly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for freshman to learn about the Supreme Court from one of if not the expert on the subeject. The weekly in-class discussions were so fascinating and informative. Professor Fallon is an amazing teacher and is genuinely excited to be teaching undergraduates. He's very accessible, knowledgable, and a great person to know. I would recommend this class to anyone with an interest in law, legal scholarship, or American history. It truly is a remarkable course.</comment>This is an incredible class: it changed my thoughts and opinions on the United States and what it means to be an American, and the chance to be in a class with Professor Fallon was absolutely unreal.</comment>If you're interested in the Supreme Court, make sure to apply for this seminar! Prof. Fallon is brilliant - he leads engaging conversations, assigns really interesting readings, and curates a great group of students to make discussions a blast! It's mainly theoretical, which surprised me. Also note that it is a lot of work and didn't really feel less stressful than letter-grade classes. Though Prof. Fallon is so approachable and understanding (ended class an hour early on Ec10 exam dates, etc.), it's hard to slack off because you just want to do right by this terrific professor. In any case, it's worth it!</comment>If you are at all interested in the law or in government, take this class! (No background knowledge is necessary.) Professor Fallon is an incredible teacher; he maintains a perfect balance between showering the class with praise and frequently challenging our opinions. The readings are intense in both depth and volume, but they're really intriguing. The class itself provides freshmen with an excellent opportunity to have lively discussions in a respectful and intellectual environment. Plus, the small class size facilitates quick class bonding. You come away at the end of the semester with a whole new perspective on the way government and American society functions. Bottom line, TAKE THIS COURSE!</comment></course>SLAVIC 185: 18th-Century Russian Literature: Seminar</title>The best course I've taken. Prof. Khitrova is an informative, inspiring instructor, and with each two-hour lecture she painted a gorgeous picture of a particular moment in 18th-c. Russian literary history. Her affection for these authors is infectious.  The readings were formidable in vocab and volume, even for the grad students who had perfect fluency in Russian, but it was worth it.</comment>This is your best chance to have a great 18th century Russian literature course -- Professor Khitrova presents her material with great richness and depth.</comment></course>GOV 1368: The Politics of American Education</title>It is an easy class on a pretty interesting subject but the videos get pretty annoying and sometimes lecture can be boring.</comment>If you would like to gain an in-depth overview of the history of the American education system and the current challenges a and ideas for reform you should take this class. In a short amount of time you cover a lot of material without feeling overwhelmed by it. Assignments allow you to form your own judgements on how to improve education.</comment>Skip it. Lectures are not at all useful if you've watched the videos before class, which themselves have relatively little content; I'm not sure I ever learned something I couldn't have gotten from perusing the syllabus on my own.  Take Professor Fryer's education class if you're interested in the topic.   TFs were nice!</comment>I took this as a senior as a gov elective. If you are interested in education, this is a great course. The material presented is a great overview of the literature and is presented in an accessible way. The quiz every week is easy - just watch the videos. Don't let that scare you off. The assignments are straightforward so if you want an easy grade, go for it too. The course could be improved a lot. Its an academic version of USW 35 - you learn more content but it is just taught in an uninspiring, unengaging way.</comment>The topics covered in class are really interesting and Prof. Peterson and the TFs are very nice. However, we don't go very deep into the material, lectures and the material are a little bit repetitive and it is very clear from sections that some students really don't care and still do well.</comment>The video component of this course actually helps you stay on top of the work. The Material is very interesting and the assignments are fair. The daily quizzes are no big deal if you have watched the videos and the memo was a short but close look at a policy that intrigued you. Definitely recommend for someone with interest in education policy.</comment>This was a fine class. Hopefully they smooth out the EdX side of things-it makes the lecture component feel almost tacked on as is. But even if they don't change anything, it was still an okay class. Interesting stuff, and it's definitely important.</comment>The content is great for anyone with the slightest interest in education: it is a thorough overview of the issues in American education, including historical context and a look into policies for the future. However, prof Peterson is not very personally engaged with his students so lectures can be a little dull, especially when they rehash the lecture videos. Overall, midterm and final weren't hard and there is plenty of time to do the (short) final memo. Take the class!</comment>The course provides a great overview of the American education system. It goes over the basics of each of the major topics which was helpful, so if you already know a lot about the different aspects of the school system it may not be the most exciting class. Lectures are mainly discussion based, as all of the material is learned through videos you have to watch beforehand, and the weekly readings are manageable.</comment>The subject matter is interesting but lecture becomes a repeat of videos watched outside class. Not a difficult gov elective.</comment>This course was a wonderful survey of the core issues regarding public education in America, from past to present. For anyone interested in education, particularly education policy, I highly recommend this course.</comment></course>AESTH&INTP 51: The Cosmos of the Comedy</title>Keep up with the readings and you should do excellent.</comment>Great Professor, great class, Dante is always great.</comment>Very interesting class, Schnapp is very engaging.</comment>If you are interested in any way in studying The Comedy, professor Schnapp is the man to do it with; he is encyclopedic. If you can't stomach literary lectures, stay away, but as far as literary lectures go, these are the best.</comment>This is an amazing chance to read a classic piece of Western canon. The lectures are amazing, and the sections are more than just a a repetition of lecture. The reading load isn't too heavy either. The only problem is the papers—the syllabus says 3-5 pages, but that means 6-10 as the papers are assigned to be single spaced. Really tho, this is a pretty light load for such an amazing class.</comment>I absolutely loved this class and you will too if you have any interest in Italian culture or religion! Professor Schnapp is extremely engaging and knowledgeable. I was always impressed by his ability to talk for hours about Dante's poem without any aids. But don't worry, the lectures were accessible to non-Dante scholars. The Dantethon (creative project) was also really fun! This is a great (also not too difficult) class to fulfill a gen ed.</comment>Just take it. Literally I have nothing negative to say about the class. Super manageable workload but the class gets you thinking... Also the Digital Dantethon project was easily more fun than any other college project I've done.</comment></course>LITER 121: From the 1001 Nights to the Arabian Nights : Adaptation, Transformation, Translation</title>This class is one of the best classes I have taken at Harvard! Between Dr. Naddaff, the rest of my classmates, and very interesting classes, I feel like I learned a lot and had a great time doing so!</comment>Of all the classes I have taken in the comp lit department, this was my favorite. Dr. Naddaff is just an amazing professor, and I highly recommend that everyone take a class with her.</comment>TAKE THIS CLASS! Prof. Naddaff is awesome. There's so much cool material to read and look at (art, music, DISNEY'S ALADDIN), and there's always so much to talk about, it's really a very thought-provoking environment. I took it as an english major looking for a seminar requirement and it went beyond my expectations. Granted, the whole class is reading, a LOT of reading, but it's all really riveting stuff. The stories are designed to make you want to keep reading! So, TAKE THIS CLASS!</comment></course>FOLKMYTH 153: South Asian Folklore</title>This class is so wonderful! It's a great and light overview of all the different folklore genres in South Asia, and it DOES cover all areas of South Asia, not just India. The folklore collection project is really fun and interesting, and gives you a taste of what ethnography is like, but in an accessible way. Class itself is really chill and just a discussion of the readings- if you have any interest in South Asia at all or just want to learn more about the area's traditions and art forms, this class is optimal for that.</comment>A brilliant class to take. Very interesting and not too much work required and yet you earn a lot about South Asia.</comment></course>PSY 1900: Introduction to Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences</title>It's a great introduction to the subject, the workload is minimal, and I feel like you do learn a lot, especially in sections.</comment>Good if you're looking for a very basic overview of statistics, although no one really knew what was going on in lecture usually. The tests and quizzes were always multiple choice and pretty easy if you know the lecture slides, even if you don't really know what they mean. No homework/psets, and final project was easy if you attended section. Don't expect to really know statistics after taking this class though.</comment>The class is easy in terms of workload but you learn nothing and it's extremely confusing. Not that easy to do well on the exams since you learn literally nothing. Patrick's lectures are very unclear and it's difficult to take notes</comment>If you're considering taking a stats class (especially for psych concentrators), take this class!!! I am so happy that I chose to take it with Professor Mair instead of during the spring time. The tests are non-cumulative, the quizzes are super easy, and the material begins from the basic. Professor Mair said on the first day of class that all that you need to do is pay attention and stay focused for one hour during lecturer and that's it. You don't have psets or the need to go over slides later (unless you're studying for exams).</comment>This is a relatively easy class, but it's definitely good to take because you learn some very important statistical tools and some coding.</comment>A pretty easy way to take a statistics class! Gets you some experience with R coding and the basic concepts of stats.</comment>Show up to class, review the slides before the exams and quizzes, and you will be totally fine. If you need to take statistics for some requirement or another, TAKE THIS CLASS</comment>This course is really great. It is not difficult but gives you a good understanding of statistical concepts and R which is really useful for the sciences and makes you look really good to employers.</comment>This course is a great course that truly puts less emphasis on outside work, and more on inside class understanding and shows great ways to apply the material to real-life examples more so than other stat courses.</comment>This is the required department basic methods course for psychology. The class is very straightforward and requires almost no outside work. Lectures are easy to follow, and Professor Mair really tries to add energy and flavor to them. The assessments in this course are very fair, and as long as you read the lecture slides, you should be fine. The best part of the course, by far, is lab section where you learn R and how to apply it to the concepts learned in lecture. This is a great course if you want a painless introduction to statistics.</comment>If you are concentrating in Psychology, take it! It's a good intro to Stat (and may be more appropriate for Psych concentrators than, say Stat 104), and learning R was really interesting and not stressful at all.</comment>This class is very manageable.</comment>PSY1900 is a gem of a class. You learn so much conceptually without having to engage with too much math. This is perfect for a student who wants to gain knowledge about data analysis without spending their entire semester dedicated to the matter. It was a wonderful class led by dedicated professors.</comment>If you have never taken statistics before, you may be a little overwhelmed at first, but it moves slowly and you will be a pro by the end. Professor Mair is very funny, reasonable and intelligent. He asks very little in terms of work, but you come away with a great understanding.</comment>Patrick is really good, and this course will teach you a lot about how to evaluate and produce basic statistical analysis. Make sure you understand the material from the first couple weeks, as it lays the foundation for the whole course.</comment>Its good to learn R</comment>Very cool class and not too much maintenance. Fairly straightforward requirement.</comment>very little work, can be confusing at times. go to section</comment>Patrick has designed the course in a way that you will learn the basics of statistics without feeling overwhelmed. He is a wonderful teacher, especially for those that may have some anxiety about the subject.</comment>This class was easily and relatively painless but frustrating at times from not understanding material - not because it was complex but could be presented in a confusing manner with little additional material or notes to back it up. Perfectly fine way to satisfy PSY stat requirement. Interesting to learn R code.</comment>Terrible. If you actually want to learn Statistics do not take this course. Patrick literally just spits out definitions to you. Do not take this course.</comment>I didn't have much statistics knowledge before taking this course, so it did a very good job as an Intro course. The course also moved at a good pace; it wasn't too slow or too fast.</comment>The course is very theoretical and not application based.  The teacher is amazing and really enthusiastic about having students understand the material.  The hardest part of the course is learning to code in R, but the sections make it very easy to learn this.</comment>This is a course you have to take as a psych concentrator.  Lectures aren't especially compelling or novel, but the lab component is definitely worthwhile.  RStudio is really helpful and cool, and it's a good thing to have on a resume.</comment>This is a great class. You learn useful skills in R and it's not a lot of work.</comment>This class has very little work, but to be successful you need to do what is asked of you which includes readings and going over the lectures a little bit on your own</comment>This class is easy but boring. Prof. Mair is not good at lecturing, and the readings are too dense to help. I learned statistics using khan academy.</comment>Very straightforward and easy if you just pay attention and follow along. I really liked learning R - it would really come in handy, and it's kind of rewarding to be able to code (though at a relatively simple level) something when I'm not in CS or anything like that.</comment>This is a great intro to stats, in a low-stress setting. Take it with Professor Mair, he's great!</comment>This class is very much an APPLIED statistics class. If you're looking to understand statistics, this is not the class for you. If you are going to have to use statistical tests in the future and need to know how to use R, this is a good choice. Also, completely unrelated to Psychology.</comment>Section (learning R) is what makes this class so valuable.</comment>Make sure review lectures.</comment>Absurdly easy. Does teach you the fundamentals of statistics, but you could also get away without learning anything. The exams are I guess pretty well designed to test actual understanding - they require little to no memorization.</comment>the content for me personally was difficult to follow</comment>This class was a breeze. Took it with a very difficult chem class which helped balance my schedule, but if you have three other reasonable classes this would be a very easy fifth if you have any statistical background at all. Lecture is pretty unnecessary as long as you review the slides</comment>Take it if you're looking for an easy class...as someone who is interested in statistical theory, I was frustrated by the fact that we learned about the purposes of different statistical tests, but didn't learn how they actually work.</comment>No work, great teaching, fun and applicable!</comment>This class is a gem. There is very little work aside from studying for the three quizzes and three exams which are so easy if you study the lecture slides. In addition, section really teaches you how to use R, and the final project is not hard at all.</comment></course>HAA 310a: Methods and Theory of Art History</title>Any student who intend to pursue a professional career in art history should take the course.</comment></course>APPHY 284: Statistical Thermodynamics</title>Very comprehensive, thorough course on statistical mechanics with fantastic connection to experiment and various different systems.</comment>Great class, very practical and with an emphasis on physical intuition it will benefit you in any area of research. Much, much better than other versions of the course I shopped in the past.</comment>Great self-contained overview of stat mech, especially for experimentalists - with a focus on phase transitions (last third of course) and connection to experimental results (including recent results). Covers all the fundamentals but not in full mathematical rigor - serious aspring stat mech theorists might prefer a more mathematical course.</comment>The course is difficult and requires a large time-commitmend, but it is very well taught and teaches a lot of background.</comment>I had some experience with the physics version of this course. The material was presented much more clearly by Vinny. I also enjoyed the problems that linked the material to actual experiments and papers.</comment>Prof. Manoharan is a very good lecturer and I would recommend taking this course when he is teaching it.</comment>Very well taught, Vinny is a great lecturer.</comment>The lectures are great but the problem sets could be confusing.</comment>The course is a great overview and review of statistical mechanics. It can definitely get you excited about the many ways statistical mechanics is applied to different types of problems.</comment>Of all the physics department courses I've taken, this one had the most applications for people working in experimental physics and applied physics. This course takes a good amount of time. I wouldn't take more than one other time-intensive physics course with it or more than two other less intensive courses, especially if you want to get any research done. This course covers a wide base of material, but covers each part in enough depth for it to be useful. Go to office hours more often than I did.</comment></course>FRSEMR 35v: Poems and Photographs</title>It's an interesting class but can be a bit boring sometimes. Some of the discussions drag on because students aren't willing to say anything. There are a lot of essays assigned and it's not advertised as a writing heavy class. There are a lot of poems from the same writers, so sometimes it lacks variety.</comment>The texts are very engaging, but don't underestimate the amount of reading time required simply because this is a seminar. Structure your time well.</comment>This class was an overall positive experience, but be warned: Although it is a Sat./Unsat. class, it comes with a considerable amount of work. If you are looking for an easy freshman seminar to fit into your schedule, DO NOT take this course. If you are interested in the subject matter or in getting to know a wonderful and caring professor, then I would recommend the course.</comment>I couldn't understand the poems and there was a lot of writing.</comment>This class really taught me how to approach poetry and photography; it showed me how to enter a text and find my own meaning within it. The collaborative discussions we had in class opened my mind to other entry points and taught me to appreciate different perspectives.</comment>This class does not require a large time commitment from week to week. Professor Feuerstein provides a lot of feedback week to week on essays and responses which can be helpful. There is a lot of freedom to chose areas of interest and you are free to write about whatever peaks your interest from the poems, photographs, and critical readings of the week. A very easy, yet interesting freshman seminar with a very caring and sweet professor. Take it!</comment>This class challenged my perceptions of the way space, time, materiality, and art as a whole work in the world. Take it if you're going to dedicate yourself to it, and read everything!</comment></course>GOV 94q: US-Latin American Relations: Seminar</title>If you are interested in Latin America or US foreign policy in the slightest absolutely take the course. Only take the class if you feel really excited about it because if not you're taking another student's place from the lottery who would probably love to be there.</comment>This is a wonderful seminar in the Government department. If you are interested in learning about a breadth of topics in the relation between the US and the Latin American region, then take this class! There are four papers throughout the course, which I found much better than a final 30 page paper as it allows one to analyze and grapple with more topics during the course. These papers also help in class discussions as students come more prepared to discuss readings. More importantly, the course is taught by Professor Dominguez, who is very devoted to undergraduate education. He provides extensive feedback on assignments, hosts a weekly lunch, and starts each course with academic advice. Hands down, one of the best courses I have taken at the college.</comment>This is one of the best classes out there and Prof. Dominguez is amazing! The sections are very engaging and the two hours of class really fly by. If you are interested in Latin America or really enjoyed Gov 1295, this is an excellent course to take.</comment>This class is phenomenal! Professor Dominguez is a top-rate scholar and such an approachable person who is really deeply invested in your growth over the course of the semester.</comment>Take this class!! This is a great class to take if you have any interest in Latin American political issues and how the U.S. relates to this. Even if you don't, you'll learn a ton about the region and about political science in general. Of all the government classes I've taken, this one has had the best discussions. It is a lot of reading, but extremely worth it. You have a lot of freedom to write about what you want for the four papers over the course of the semester. Completely worth the time you put into it!</comment>Take advantage of Prof. Dominguez's lunches and availability. He's super smart and approachable. Also, ask him about advice on writing a thesis.</comment>Do not miss a chance to expand your knowledge of Latin America in the environment most conducive to discussion at Harvard.</comment>Highly recommend this class! It is one of the most enjoyable government seminars to take and the work load is spread throughout the course in an appropriate way rather than being clustered towards the end of the semester. Professor Dominguez is engaging, knowledgeable and passionate about the topic, and really makes the two hours worth of class much more interesting.</comment>This is one of the best courses I have taken at Harvard! Professor Domínguez is absolutely amazing, and you will learn a ton about U.S. foreign policy and Latin American relations. However, if you don't have much interest in these issues, this might not be the class for you, since much of the class involves delving deeply into specific issues or case studies.</comment>This was hands-down one of my absolute favorite courses at Harvard! Professor Domínguez is an incredible seminar instructor who involves everyone in the discussion, generates effusive enthusiasm, and surprises you with new lessons/takeaways from each of the readings. The readings were well selected and always interesting! Although of course lengthy, the texts we were assigned to read shed great insight into US-Latin American relations. Some prior background in Latin American politics or US foreign relations is helpful but not required. Professor Dominguez also did a phenomenal job including all students and really creating an environment of constructive dialogue, where students could learn from their peers. Even when not everyone did the readings -- inevitable, given the amount of readings assigned -- Professor Domínguez still kept discussion alive. He also tells remarkable stories! Overall, this class is an absolute "gem" at Harvard. I highly, highly recommend it!</comment></course>PSY 1304: Brain Damage as a Window into the Mind: Cognitive Neuropsychology</title>Fantastic course! This class is an amazing introduction to cognitive neuropsychology by an amazing professor who is a leader in the field.</comment>Professor Caramazza is fantastic at lecturing and facilitating discussion. We were able to cover a wide range of topics, jumping into each quite substantively. The readings were fantastic (both Ward and the papers). Also amazing how the best work in the field pays homage via citations to Professor Caramazza. Take this course to have a discussion about any singular topic with him, if nothing else.</comment>Excellent class and excellent professor. You get to cover some of the most fascinating topics in neuropsychology and cognitive neuroscience, in a small setting, led by a world-renowned Professor whose passion for the subject matter is extremely contagious and inspiring (not all that common to find among Harvard professors!). Professor Caramazza cares about your learning and makes himself widely available should you want to discuss certain topics to a further extent. Hands down one of my favorite classes at Harvard. By the end of the class, you are more convinced than ever that the workings of the brain are perhaps the most interesting thing there ever was to do research on.</comment>A great way to learn from one of the most brilliant neuropsychologists in the world, in a small intimate group.</comment>very good if you're interested in cognitive neuroscience. less focus on the patients and the case studies themselves rather than getting a grip on cognitive neuroscience as a whole, but still a nice class.</comment>Great class. Don't be intimidated by the 2.5 hours - it goes by quickly and we even ran out of time to have complete discussions because there is a lot of interesting material and a lot to be said about it.</comment>Prof Caramazza is very engaging and excited about work in his field of neuropsychology.  The readings are engaging, and overall the topics of the course are interesting to learn about.  I really enjoyed getting to be in a smaller class taught by a professor who really enjoys student input and encouraged participation.  I would recommend the class for anyone interested specifically in neuropsychology and especially language but also to people interested in representations of cognition in general.  I learned a lot about the importance of single case studies and about different approaches to creating cognitive models and theories.  I found the course interesting and Professor Caramazza very approachable and engaging.</comment></course>SOC-STD 98mi: Migration in Theory and Practice</title>The readings in this course are excellent, a combination of ethnographic and theoretical texts that ask the reader to challenge their assumptions about the relationship between citizen and the state. It's also a really productive space to think about all kinds of identities of belonging, and how they affect our experience of nations and nationality. But overall, this course is very much designed to help Social Studies concentrators figure out what they're doing. It's a great one to take your junior fall for that reason. Nicole is one of the best teachers out there. She's been a very encouraging, thoughtful, and informative mentor to have during the research process. If you take this course and are interested in the topic, you're making a good choice both in terms of material and professor!</comment>This is a great class. Nicole really cares about her students and the material. I think she does a great job of helping everyone learn the present material, but also in working with students to make sure they are developing their own unique interests.</comment>This class was good overall. It was a bit too structure for my taste but if you're into that then you'll likely enjoy this.</comment>Take this class if you are considering doing interviews for your thesis and/or your focus field is even tangentially related to migration/citizenship issues. Nicole will provide very detailed and exhaustive feedback on your work.</comment>If you are a social studies major, and planning on doing field research, then I strongly recommend this course. Nicole is an invaluable resource, very friendly, and prepares her students for both the interview process and the writing process. If you have an interest in writing your thesis on the subject of migration than this is a must take.</comment></course>COMPSCI 187: Computational Linguistics</title>got to learn pretty cool stuff on natural language processing (NLP)! very manageable in terms of difficulty level, while you sitll get exposed to new things. lectures can be slow and soporific at times but the material is interesting. workload in the last month has a sharp increase comparing to previous ones, so be prepared -- it started off easy but suddenly has many deadlines jammed together toward the end. overall, worth to take if you want to learn NLP.</comment>I am a linguistics concentrator, and I enjoyed this class. It was a good introduction to computational linguistics, and though I have a bunch of quibbles about the field in general (most relating to a generally hand-wavy cop-out attitude toward actual linguistics), it is really interesting. I was also happy for the chance to actually learn Python. If you study linguistics and have some programming experience, try it out: people will defer to your opinion on language matters, and come to you with questions about parts of speech and stuff. It's fun.   On a logistic note, Prof. Shieber is generally pretty entertaining; the lectures are good if you pay attention; the problem sets are interesting and stimulating; and though the course had major organizational issues this year, I think we students raised enough of a kerfuffle that they'll be worked out in the future.   (Just in case, these were the issues: 1. Easy problem sets at the beginning that get very hard toward the end; 2. Final project waypoint deadlines interspersed with difficult problem set deadlines, making it difficult to do either as well as one would like; 3. A number of F.A.S. rule violations, including lectures during reading period and assignment due-dates during reading period.)</comment>This was a good course, especially early. You learn about textual analysis in terms of statistical methods and logical/grammar-based methods. This year, there were 4 problem sets plus multiple final project deadlines in late November / early December, which was really hectic.</comment>This is a great class and Professor Shieber is really nice and on your side! Please get to know him better! He is really cool and the material is awesome!</comment>I really, really wish I could recommend CS187. The material is engaging, the problem sets are interesting and useful, and the entire teaching staff seems genuinely dedicated to fostering our understanding of computational linguistics.  The problem is that the logistics were just a complete, utter mess. I know Professor Shieber has taught this class before, so I don't understand how he overestimated the amount of material he could cover in a semester to such a degree. There were far too many assignments, which increased sharply in length and complexity in the last month or so - just when we also were starting on final projects. He also tried some odd things like an assigned partner pset, a hybrid group-individual structure for the final project, and a writing practicum aspect to the project, none of which, I suspect, worked out quite as he had envisioned.</comment>This is really interesting material, however be very wary of the class organization. Lectures can be dry at times and not that great at actually teaching the concepts, so often it's better to read the textbook/course notes (which often don't cover everything that's said in class). Unless the course format changes in future years, be prepared to be inundated with work towards the end of the semester, even during reading period, so make sure to account for course work.</comment>Take this class if you are curious about NLP and have a high threshold for pain and painstaking things. The assignments do go in depth and provide intellectual challenge as the semester progresses. Lectures also get much better when programming in Prolog section starts. However, there may be just 1 or 2 too many assignments, as there's something due every week, for a total of 10 assignments in the semester, along with your concurrently running final project starting in November. So look before you enroll in this class.</comment>The material in this course is interesting. Shieber is extremely passionate and that definitely shines through. That said, the material later in the course is considerably more difficult and so students struggling with earlier problem sets should consider dropping the class. In fall 2014, the new final project format meant that there were many weeks with problem sets and final project components due; this made for a very stressful end of the semester.</comment>This class ruined my semester. From blatantly disregarding FAS course policies (we had class during reading period as well as project deadlines through reading period and through the second to last day of finals period) to the passive aggressiveness of instructor responses on piazza and the low quality lectures (many students chose not to attend, and out of the group that did, there was always one napper and occasionally a student who obviously wasn't paying attention, and, for example, doing origami instead), this course was disastrous. Though I had misgivings, the course material interested me enough that I stayed through the 5th week, which is about when everything went down the drain. The problem set difficulty increased exponentially while the lectures became way less helpful and way more boring. If you are able to focus on Professor Shieber's conversational and winding lecture style, then this class may be bearable for you. The course staff did not seem very interested in actually helping us, and most Piazza answers completely avoided the question at hand, and instead adopted a chastising tone and redirected the student to course notes, or the assignment instructions.</comment>You'll definitely learn some cool material. For example, suppose you had a bunch of sentences with the spaces removed, in a language you were completely unfamiliar with. What algorithm would you use to determine where the word breaks are?

Having said this, I think it's important to note that Shieber is, much more so than any professor I have encountered, very focused on presentation. As a result, you'll spend a lot of time proofreading (code, problem set writeups, final project writeup). This is exacerbated by the grading scale (1-5). Basically if you make no mistakes you get a 5, and if you make even a small mistake you'll get knocked down to a 4. This necessitates a ton of proofreading, which I didn't feel was very valuable.</comment>The material is fairly interesting, but ends up being a little too specific/niche for me. Computational linguistics is one of those problems that's sort of impossible to fully solve, so most algorithms/techniques are heuristics or approximations, which is a little unsatisfying.

Also, the workload of this class really ramps up at the end, where we had 2 psets and the final project all due within a span of about 2 weeks. Also, a lot of the work is silly stuff like writing a specifically formatted documentation string for every function in your code, or spending a lot of extra time because the pset specification is unclear or vague. For some reason, it seems that the only responses the course staff are allowed to give on Piazza are quoting the specification, or "it's up to you" (which isn't actually true, grade-wise). This is a shame because a lot of people have very legitimate questions that probably would benefit from an actual answer.
Also, the final projects are chosen for you (there's a set of N projects and you rank them and get put on one) and most aren't particularly interesting. The end of the class really becomes kind of a drag.

Even despite all this, I'd probably still take the course—it's an interesting subtopic of CS that likely has applications in a lot of other fields. Hopefully one day machines will be able to understand standard English/other languages. But there are probably better courses to take if you have a packed schedule already.</comment>I'm not sure if the field of computational linguistics is just not for me, but this course wasn't what I expected. I'm not entirely sure I can even say now what I've learned in this course or what computational linguistics even is, but apparently I was able to get through the psets (which were still a fair amount of work). Prof Shieber is really nice and most likely has done brilliant research, but is not the most organized or engaging lecturer. There's also too much expectation that you will read the textbook on your own (and lectures as I mentioned are not particularly helpful). You do get to learn Prolog, which is a really interesting language to program in (and I'd recommend checking it out even if you don't take this class)</comment>This is class that I really wanted to like.  The material is pretty interesting and Prof Shieber is a great guy.  However, there are some fundamental problems in the architecting in the course.  Problem sets are very easy at the beginning of the semester but then become basically impossible toward the end.  In addition, while these psets are becoming impossible, a six-stage final project appears.  Furthermore, Prof Shieber expected us to attend class through reading period.  The class needs to be fundamentally restructured in its pacing</comment>The material is very interesting. The first part of the course has a lot of machine learning, and the second part transitions from Python to Prolog and makes greater use of structure and semantics. The course gets significantly harder towards the end of the semester. Project and homework deadlines overlap as the assignments get more difficult.</comment>Very interesting material that is also very well-taught. NLP is a fascinating subject area, and you'll learn a lot of the fundamental techniques in this course. However, the course sometimes (particularly toward the end of the semester) scrunches together deadlines, which makes assignments hectic/stressful; hopefully that can be improved in future iterations.</comment>Very good course overall. Some lectures are pretty slow, but then other lectures are pretty confusing and could be slowed down. So I think if the teaching staff does a little better job of balancing the course it could be made better. However, I didn't actually have too many complaints about this and enjoyed the material and psets. Staff is very nice.</comment>Do not take this course unless they change the workload. Or if you're obsessed with natural language processing. I took it because I like most artificial intelligence classes, and I took it for fun. 
There were assignments every week, which were difficult but doable when they only took 10-15 hours. But then they started becoming more unreasonable, requiring more like 30 hours and unimaginable frustration, on behalf of most people in the class. (I know I am not an anomaly). There were only 2 hours of office hours a week, though the tfs were pretty open to helping if you asked. 

This is what I wrote to the instructors:

The course needs to reduce the amount it teaches. We should not be required to attend class during reading period just to fit in more content that the professor wants to cover. We should not be required to complete assignments (that take 30 hours or more) while we are working on the final project. Assignments should be finished if there is going to be a final project. Further, the last four assignments should have two weeks in between them, rather than one, in order to get them done reasonably. This was the only class I did significant work for, and I still couldn't fit all the work in when working on it full time. There should be more than 2 hours of office hours a week.</comment></course>ETH-REASON 32: Security: Carefree or Careless</title>This course is perhaps the greatest way to fulfill the ER gened. Professor Hamilton is incredibly engaging and really cares about entertaining his students. Yes, there are weekly reading quizzes but they are super easy if you have just skimmmed the reading. The assignments are also really short and dont take all that might time to write. The final wasnt even a final---was just another paper that was worth a little bit more. And the material is also surprisingly interesting if you are interested in political philosophy/government at all. That being said, I did think that the course would focus more on modern day security whereas it looks must more at older theories and doesnt delve much into current society. Overall, if you are looking for an ER class that will be actually interesting (not like the snoozefest that is ER18) and not very difficult, then look no further than ER32.</comment>Very thoughtful course, but be warned that it's misleading in its shopping week promotion. I thought it would actually talk about philosophical issues in modern security (ie wire-tapping and body searches). The class is really more about how philosophers approach security on the level of society (ie How does society decide who should be in charge?). This is still a useful topic, but know what it is going in.</comment>The class was not as interesting as I hoped it would be--the 2 hour lectures do take a toll on you. I'm not really sure what I got out of the class that I did not get in the first few lectures, but it just may be because I'm not much of a philo person. I did like the Freud and Kafka bits of it. Hamilton is a great lecturer, but I think I would like his Lit/ German lectures better. His interpretations of the root of words is interesting, but also gets a little old.</comment>Very low work load, and time commitment, but the materials are dense, and there is a possibility of feeling like an idiot in section.</comment>It is a relatively easy class, however the material is extremely boring and overall a subpar class.</comment>Take it: this class moves one careful step into your careless self.</comment>The professor is great in lecture, although the material itself is lackluster, as seen by the class that gradually thins out each week throughout lecture. Quizzes are given to boost grades but also to make sure people show up, otherwise it is likely people wouldn't come at all, because lecture can be such a drag at times. Interesting concept, but hesitant to recommend because the structure of the class itself is lame and section can also be quite boring depending on the TF.</comment>This is a very interesting way to fulfill an ER requirement. Professor Hamilton is an excellent lecturer, and sections give way to really great discussions. It's helpful to be able to think/express yourself philosophically, and quite a bit harder than I thought it would be in terms of writing papers. Readings are great--at one point I was actually thinking about taking a Gov class (which I've never done) just because the political theorist we were reading wrote so clearly about his topic.</comment>This class was pretty underwhelming.  It was so concentrated on philosophy and I thought it was going to be more interesting.  If you're looking for an easy Eth-Resoning course that you don't have to do much work in then it's not a bad class.</comment>The mini quizzes at the beginning of every class are nothing to worry about; they are simply reading checks. However, this will force you to keep up with the readings, which can occasionally be a bit tedious in their language, especially in the earlier documents.  The TFs were great, and were readily accessible, providing constructive feedback on papers.  Section can be a bit dry, especially if everyone is there simply because they must, but since their grade is tied to participation, it usually is a good discussion.</comment>This class is more philosophical than the blurb will have you believe. Be careful when taking it if you aren't into philosophy - go through the syllabus and get a sense of what you'll be reading. The course isn't about ethics of security in the modern world.</comment>Wonderful way to satisfy the Ethical Reasoning class. I've heard excellent things about Sandel's classes, but this is one to definitely check out! Incredibly accommodating, well-balanced, and the amount of work expected from a gen ed.</comment>While this class is relatively low workload, the weekly reading quizzes mean you have to try and get through long and dense philosophical texts. If you have no background in ancient history you will find this very difficult. Prof. Hamilton is very nice and tries to be engaging, but the two hour lecture drags on quite often.</comment>It isn't too hard, but you need to pay attention in order to do well on the papers and the quizzes.</comment>I chose this class because of the high Q scores, and I was disappointed.  I had no background whatsoever in philosophy or really any humanities, and I always felt like I was falling behind everyone else.  The material was interesting at times, but sometimes I wondered the relevance of the things we were reading.  The grading was frustratingly hard considering how much effort I put into this class.  On the positive side, only having lecture once a week was pretty awesome.</comment>It's a good way to do your ER gen ed requirement.  Professor Hamilton is really funny, and although I'm definitely NOT a philosophy person, the readings were accessible</comment>Too much reading. This is NOT an interesting class about security in the contemporary sense. It's basically a philosophy class! That's graded super hard.</comment>This class will not force you to engage too much with the material, but if you do it is a rewarding look into viewpoints on security across history... a more interesting topic than it sounds!</comment>A really interesting course. Professor Hamilton is one of the best professors I have had at Harvard. He is funny, entertaining, and made me really interested in the material. The in-class quizzes are easy if you've done the reading but the response papers are kind of a pain since they aren't clearly explained and they're graded really harshly unless you can write like Kant but that might also depend on your TF</comment>I think this is one of the best examples of what a Gen Ed requirement should be--very much relevant to our daily lives and developing a broad understanding of a field of thought (here, security theory). The lectures are well-delivered if a bit long, the assignments all easy, section occasionally boring but usually mildly interesting. The readings are fantastic and definitely a very good reading list for an overview of the field. If anything, I wish this course had been more rigorous so that we could have had better and more productive discussions on it, because I think very interesting ideas and authors (eg Foucault) were presented at a much shallower level than they deserved.</comment>Professor Hamilton is a quintessential quirky professor who generates enthusiasm for a subject which could easily slip into boredom.</comment>Great Professor and TFs</comment>Take this class. You will not regret it. The course touches on many large questions discussing what is security, and how it can be maintained. You will deal with texts and authors that are quite fundamental to political philosophy. All the while, Prof Hamilton is from the Comp Lit department, so actually the connections between some of the texts are not just thematic but literary as well - this was super enjoyable for me, and actually inspired me to apply some of the perspectives of this class to my life. (I.e. Oedipus is name dropped throughout lecture throughout the semester, although the play never really explicitly mentions anything about security, but Hamilton will make it super relevant).</comment>Very interesting and easy course</comment>You have to attend every lecture. There is a reading quiz in the first 10 minutes and when there are papers due, you have to hand in a hard copy only at the end of lecture, which is 2 hours long. Lecture is good and Hamilton is interesting, but it is also very easy to be distracted. Section you are not allowed to use your computers so taking notes in a notebook is kind of essential. The workload is actually not bad at all. The final though is 2500 words which is actually kind of long compared to our other papers that were only 3-4 pages.</comment>This class is a great way to fulfill Ethical Reasoning!  There is no need to be familiar with philosophy at all (though it would definitely help).  I took it as my first philosophy class, and it was a perfect way to test the waters.  I am a huge German fan, so I loved Professor Hamilton's allusions to the German language.  He includes a lot of etymology in his lectures which is interesting whether or not you know the languages to which he refers.  He makes an effort to make the class manageable and fun (quizzes are laughably easy if you've done the readings).  Two hour lectures are tiring, but please don't leave in the middle.  Prof. Hamilton is sad to see people leave.   No, I am not Prof. Hamilton.   Really though, this is an easy but interesting way to fulfill ER.  Take it!</comment>Professor Hamilton is very knowledgable and is a wonderful lecturer. The course load is very manageable. The reading quizzes really helped me to not fall behind on the readings and better engage with the material. It was also very intriguing to hear about other students' interpretations about different topics. I think it's a great course to take to satisfy ethical reasoning while learning about different philosophies. Even though I dreaded taking a philosophy class to satisfy ER, I found the course very enjoyable. I would strongly recommend!</comment>I thought this course would at least involve at some point an evaluation of ethics of modern day security.  It didn't.  Instead it seemed that any philosophical work that mentions the word security (or didn't) was fair game for the course.  I found it very difficult to condense all these several unrelated readings into an understanding of security.  I failed at that, but I'm still not sure if that is my fault or the fault of the course.  If you've never had any prior study of Locke, Hobbes, Kant, etc., you may find yourself overwhelmed at least at the beginning of the course.</comment>This course is a good way to fulfill what is a painful Gen Ed. Professor Hamilton is very enthusiastic and fun to listen to but the content is very abstract (this is probably more a reflection of the ER requirement than this specific course).</comment>Make sure to do your readings!</comment>The reading is quite complex.</comment>Definitely do the readings!  They're really interesting.</comment>The class is fine. Professor Hamilton is pretty funny. The texts are awful. Section depends on your TF, as always. The assignments are good. There are these really ridiculous lecture quizzes to make sure you go, and for participation points, I guess.</comment>This is a great way to do ER. The professor and TFs are so nice. There are reading quizzes once a week so you have to do the readings, but usually they are somewhat fair. Pay attention to important names, distinctions in arguments, and important concepts. That will be helpful bc philosophy is hard to read. Also, meet with the TFs for writing help! I learned so much about security and the readings cover a lot of topics (check the syllabus).</comment>Lectures are very boring, and readings are dense and difficult to get through. However, quizzes are easy and essays are graded really easily, so it is easy to get a good grade in the class after you sit through the lectures every week.</comment>Not much work is required, but if you do the readings, they are very interesting.</comment>This class does an excellent job overall. The professor is an amazing lecturer, and the section discussions really push you to think critically. There is a lot of reading but the work is very doable and enjoyable since you may find a lot of the concepts to be fascinating and applicable in real life.</comment>The readings are often confusing but Professor Hamilton makes them understandable in lecture and section is a huge help</comment>I don't think there was ever a point where I felt like I had a really solid grasp of the material-- that's not a bad thing though! It just meant that the readings were very challenging and there was always more clarifying to be done. This balanced well with the super laid-back nature of Prof Hamilton and how this class was run. Weekly quizzes were written to be as easy as possible and there was an opportunity to get extra credit on each one. Prof. Hamilton even structured the classes so that late students could get there and not miss much. The grading policy was also accommodating; there was an opportunity for extra credit where students just had to watch a movie. The class's laid-back vibe made it so that students could really spend time thinking about the material (which could be really dense) and not waste their time on worrying too much about grades and such.</comment></course>ANTHRO 2704: Linguistic Pragmatics and Cultural Analysis in Anthropology</title>very useful, but also very technical. having knowledge background in linguistics will make your life easier. strongly recommended!</comment></course>NEUROBIO 101hfj: Brain Rhythms in Cognition, Mental Health & Epilepsy</title>really great teaching, contagious enthusiasm</comment>Amazing class. Feel like I've gotten a lot more comfortable reading scientific papers and I definitely know a lot more about the field of Neurobio as a whole!!</comment>Omar is an incredible teacher. He is humble and leads by pushing students modestly. The topics are fascinating and you learn a lot in little time.</comment>Figures are important! It's difficult to get into the groove, but you really do learn a lot at the end of it. The time is well worth being spent.</comment>Omar is brilliant, and has so, so much to teach everyone in the class! Papers are interesting and definitely relevant to the future of the field. Awesome class!</comment>Omar is great.  I found the first half of the course very challenging conceptually but fair grade wise.  Make sure you understand what's going on early on.  Participation is worth a lot so make sure you speak every class.</comment>Great class! Professor is excellent and gives helpful feedback. Make sure to actually read papers if you want to understand what's going on.</comment></course>CULTR&BLF 39: The Hebrew Bible</title>Offers a really interesting perspective on the Bible and how that affects thinking and traditions today.</comment>Overall, this class is, in a word: fine. The material is actually quite interesting if you take the time to go to class and enjoy it. The assignments are actually quite annoying--the prompts for the essays are very open ended and it is hard to know exactly what they are looking for. Also, the papers are of non-trivial length. That being said, for both the midterm and the final I learned everything I needed to know the day before the tests. Overall, you will probably get an A in this class but youre gonna wish you actually learned more. Being surrounded by unmotivated students that only are there for the grade is very annoying.</comment>One of the easiest classes you will take at Harvard, in the best way possible. The lectures are relatively engaging, and if you've never seriously read the Bible before, it is definitely illuminating. Professor Cohen is funny, and the class is structured pretty well. I'm really glad I decided to take this course - it's the perfect fourth class if you have other difficult courses.</comment>It's CB, study of the past, and "English" for medical school prerequisites. Take it! If you want to, you can learn tons about the Bible and how Judaism came to be such a powerful cultural institution; if you don't, the exams are fairly easy and the essays straightforward and you can coast right through.</comment>Do the readings, go to lecture. If you put in the time you will have no problems.</comment>I think that this is a good class if you have some interest in the Bible and the history behind both its origins and its interpretations. It provides a great background to the cultural conversation about the Bible and religion. Exams are not difficult, and Prof. Cohen and the TFs work to help you succeed.</comment>This class will either thoroughly educate you on the Ideologies of the hebrew bible, or it will reshape some of your understanding and beliefs of the bible.</comment>This class offers an environment of stress-free and interesting learning.  I wanted to learn the material and it didn't feel like work because it was very interesting.</comment>Low workload class.  A survey class that even those with no previous exposure may appreciate.  Approaches the historical, theological, and political elements that worked together to shape the Hebrew bible.</comment>Definitely take this class! It doesn't ask too much of us, and what you get out is what you make of it. I personally feel like I learned a lot, and actually found myself enjoying studying for its exams.</comment>Shaye is an incredibly engaging professor. Loved the course and teaching staff.</comment>Wonderful gen ed. Seriously, they prepare you for everything and give you all the materials needed to be successful in the class. But it's also very interesting, and you take a lot away from this class.</comment>Fantastic class - Professor Cohen is great</comment>This class is fantastic. The TFs are great, you learn a lot (but you get what you put in), and it's honestly one of the few Gen Eds I've really enjoyed. Take this class, you won't regret it!</comment>Great Class</comment>Day to day is easy, but writing the papers and studying for the tests takes time. However, those papers and tests are fair and plausible to score highly on if one studies hard.</comment>This is a wonderful class if you truly want to take the Bible seriously, and learn to analyze from an academic standpoint.</comment>take. this. class. take it take it take it. it's so easy to fit into your life because of the taped lectures, and you still learn a ton.</comment>It's a very straightforward class. Just do the readings, show up to section, and everything will be great.</comment>Do the readings on time, don't wait until the exams.</comment>This was by far my favorite class this fall, it was excellent! If you are at all interested in the Bible or Judaism or Christianity or even just want to fulfill your Culture & Belief requirement I highly recommend this class. It is not too stressful or overwhelming (though the midterm and final do require a significant amount of preparation) and you will learn a lot! Even if you come into the class with previous religious knowledge of the Bible you will find that this course examines it from a scholarly perspective which is very different from the traditional religious context. No matter your beliefs this is a good survey of the Hebrew Bible and provides helpful perspective on the range of scholarly opinions about the Bible.</comment>It's a wonderful opportunity to not only read the Hebrew Bible but also learn about the scholarship surrounding the Bible and its composition.  I would also recommend considering the "intensive" section if they offer that again; it doesn't require extra assignments but the discussions were great.</comment>Take this course to experience professor Cohen's lecturing skills.</comment>Make sure you get a good TF and read the material every once in a while.</comment>Great course. Was interested in the Hebrew Bible - but how can one not be as one of the founding texts of the West, so often invoked, so rarely analyzed through more than one interpretation. The course takes two main slants on the Hebrew Bible - (1) how the traditional Jewish readers  interpreted or might have interpreted parts of it, (2) how secular modern Biblical scholarship  (MBS) interprets it. Also, a little bit, how it fits into Christianity. Good for believers and non-believers, though the slant is meant to focus on MBS. The intro video lays out the course so watch that and decide for yourself.</comment>Not too much work, not that interesting however.</comment>Take the class because Professor Cohen is great, lectures are interesting and you'll always come out knowing something you didn't know before.</comment>You will get out of the course as much as you put in.</comment>It is a great class. The material is easy to learn, and the lectures are very interesting. Assignments and tests aren't too bad either.</comment>This course is great as a gen ed and a good class in general. Professor is really engaging and the TF's - especially Eric - are helpful and facilitate interest.</comment>Hebrew Bible is quite an interesting course. It challenges the basic assumptions of the Bible by taking an academic approach. Whether you're religious or not (I'm not), it's worthwhile, and not particularly difficult.</comment>study for tests</comment>You will learn and reflect a great deal on the Bible. Yet, you will not have to worry very much about your grades, allowing you to enjoy the course even more. Take the class to fulfill a Gen Ed requirement, or simply take it to pursue any interest you have in the Bible!</comment>If you are looking for an easy gen-ed that is still interesting, take this course.</comment>Easy if you try, a little bit harder to do well if you don't</comment>This course is a rare combination of interesting and very manageable workload-wise. A great gen ed for senior year and you will come away having learned a lot</comment>Great class. Study a lot for midterms and finals. Don't let yourself fall too far behind.</comment>A fairly interesting class that will require more attention and reading than you might initially expect.</comment>This course is borderline must-take, a designation I reserve for very few Harvard courses. It is fascinating material with a brilliant and entertaining lecturer. They require no more work of you than is actually necessary for you to learn. The lectures are on video. And to put it over the top, it fulfills one of the more bizarre gen ed categories. What more could you want?</comment>This class has great section leaders</comment>The material is pretty interesting, and is also very easy to understand. Paper topics were engaging and fun to write, and exams overall weren't too challenging. Completely unnecessary to show up to class, and sections were relatively easy to get through even if you didn't do the assigned reading. As long as you're capable of memorizing material for the exams and reading enough to write a good paper, you won't have any trouble with this course.</comment>Take this class, but study for it.</comment>The exams take a good amount of preparation and the papers take some time to write though you can get feedback from your TF before turning it in. Cohen is interesting and friendly but not extraordinary. You will learn as much as you put in. There are probably better CB courses out there though this will definitely be a fine way to fill the requirement if you're struggling to.</comment>don't take unless you have to. a snooze.</comment>Take this course! SERIOUSLY do it! Professor Cohen is a great lecturer and you'll learn so much. Most Harvard classes can take lessons from this in terms of how to structure their course.</comment>This class is a great course for those who are interested in learning more about the bible and how to interpret it. Very minimal workload, TF's are great, and Shaye Cohen wants the students to do well! Take it as an elective or for C&B credit.</comment>It's easy, but not as easy as people make it out to be.  Read: you will actually have to study for the exams if you want to do well.  That being said, it's still pretty easy and Prof. Cohen is a great lecturer who is really passionate about the course material.</comment>Be careful. Many students will tell you how easy this course is...it is only easy (grade-wise) if you put in the right amount of effort. Luckily, I took this class pass-fail and put in very little work. I easily would have ended up with a terrible grade with the amount of work I put in; the course requires a lot of memorization for the midterm and final, but if you put in the work, you will get an A.</comment>Fantastic course, no matter your interests you will enjoy it.</comment>Definitely take this Gen Ed. The workload is very manageable, the knowledge is useful, and the TF staff truly wants you to do well in the course.</comment>This class is a fantastic gen ed! Definitely a great way to fulfill the CB requirement. Not a huge workload and deals with really interesting subject material. You take out of it what you put in. If you really want to learn about the Hebrew Bible, there is a ton of material with which you can engage. If you are trying to balance your schedule, you can also be less engaged and still do well.</comment>TAKE THIS CLASS. It's easy, it's interesting, and you actually learn things you might care about.</comment>This course serves as a broad introduction to the Hebrew Bible. If you want to go beyond the essentials of what the lectures cover, it is really your onus to make it interesting.</comment>Really easy, really interesting.</comment>This is a great class--take it! Cohen is a phenomenal instructor. You'll learn a ton with a low workload--the sign of a great professor.</comment>This class is a very good way to fulfill your CB requirement. Eric is a great TF. Papers and exams are fair, the material is interesting, what more could you want?</comment>A class that you get as much as you put in. Very little effort is needed to get by, but if you wish to learn a lot, that opportunity is also present if you work hard.</comment>Great Gen Ed, it's super chill and the essay assignments are actually kinda fun. Take it. Work load wise, I recommend it unreservedly. It was a life saver to have this as a 4th course this semester.</comment>This class was great! Low work, and you get to learn a lot of interesting material about the Hebrew Bible. Great CB choice</comment>This class was more intense than Q scores made it out to be. If you are a Jew or a Christian that already knew some of these stories then you were ready for this class to be smooth sailing. If not, you had to put in a lot of reading time and memorize a lot of ID's and identify Bible passages. The non-essays are also a little tricky but I think it's just because the idea of a non-essay is weird to me.</comment>This course is pretty much the ideal Gen Ed course; you don't have to put in too much time (and in fact can get away with neglecting the course for the entirety of the semester and cramming for the exams), but it also features interesting material, especially if you have little or no experience with the Old Testament. Would definitely recommend as a flexible Gen Ed option.</comment>Really awesome class.</comment>If you do the reading, you will get much more out of this course.</comment>They are making it harder and less interesting every semester</comment>Good class if you're engaged by the material, but it's very easy to do no work and not listen, and get very little out of it in the end.</comment>I would definitely recommend this class. This was an easy class to balance my schedule. Professor Cohen gives you all the material necessary to do well on the exams beforehand, and the essays are painless to write - you get the option of submitting a draft to you TF.</comment>Great course. Will teach you the historical basis of the bible, and teach tut to read it in that context. I got so much more out of the text new that I have the knowledge this course gave me, which has deepened my cultural and spiritual awareness regarding Judaism.</comment>Painless way to fulfill gen ed. Good punch class. Decently interesting, not much work but the work you do is worth it. I'd recommend it</comment>This class is very interesting and not too strenuous.</comment>Shaye Cohen is good if a little dry at times.  If you don't know much/anything about the bible, or even if you think you do, it's a worthwhile course: it really gives you a good unified understanding of the themes of the torah, the bible as a whole, and thus the foundations of modern religion.  Decent amount of reading, overall good class.</comment>lectures are interesting and it's great to actually analyze the bible yourself</comment>This class is exactly what you think it is. If you have any background in the Bible, you can get an "A" without doing the readings or attending lecture. That being said, Kugel is fantastic, and I seriously recommend reading it. Cohen is also a charismatic lecturer, so try to attend lecture when you can.</comment>keep up with reading or you will really fall behind quickly</comment>Great way to fill this gen Ed requirement. An absolute gem.</comment>If you are looking to fulfill a culture and belief gen-ed, this class is great since it is interesting and does not require a lot of work</comment>Great class to take for the gen ed. Professor and TF's are great. Caters to a spectrum of interest levels.</comment>Great course. How Gen-eds should be taught.</comment>GREAT course!! The Hebrew Bible forms the basis for a significant part of Western cultural history, i.e. in art history, literature, etc, aside from being the foundational text of Judaism. Having an understanding of the stories and themes of the Hebrew Bible part of being an educated citizen and scholar. Prof. Cohen is an incredibly engaging lecturer, and sections are well organized. Can't go wrong taking this course</comment>Put in the effort and you will actually get something out of this class.  The people who just try and get by will get by but won't actually be better off after the class is done.</comment>It is a really interesting class and you can learn a lot if you put time into. It is possible to do reasonably well without devoting yourself to the material, but it is much more interesting if you do and you will walk away with the ability to engage in some really interesting conversations.</comment>Fairly easy class, with somewhat interesting material. Good way to fill CB requirement.</comment>I liked this course. I had basically no background in any of the stories of the Bible, and I'm really glad that I now know of the most important ones at least in the Old Testament. I feel that people who have experience in the subject matter definitely have an easier time, but such is the nature of life and I don't hold the course responsible. You can get an A in this class if you put in the necessary time.</comment>A really great class! You learn a great deal, especially given the amount of daily preparation needed.</comment>This class is very interesting while having little workload.</comment>This class is great if you do the readings and keep up with the lectures. I always heard it was a super easy class, but if you're not actually doing the work when it's assigned you're going to have a hard time when the midterm and final role around. You'll learn a lot though!</comment>This is absolutely great class. The Teaching Fellows all do an incredible job of making sure that you understand the lecture material and Professor Cohan is a very engaging lecturer. I would highly recommend taking this class to fulfill your Culture and Belief requirement. There is a large amount of support just before the midterm and final.</comment>This is a good course to take as an introduction to the Bible whether you ascribe to the Christian or Jewish perspective. It is also a satisfactory Gen Ed.</comment>A great way to fulfill Culture and Belief.</comment>You kind of get the idea after 1 lecture.</comment>This class is interesting and is a good overview of the Hebrew Bible.  The papers are straightforward and the exam material is all given to you before hand so it's just a lot of memorization.</comment>The course is not as easy as I thought it would be, but if you put in a decent amount of effort on a regular basis, you can definitely do well. It's a great way to learn about the old testament, which is at the core of both Christianity and Judaism. The papers you have to write are really fun and free form.</comment>The class in an excellent opportunity to learn about the Hebrew Bible. However, thorough learning would have to be through personal initiative since the coursework will not exactly demand it of you.</comment>This is a great class. Not too challenging, but still very interesting perspectives on the Bible.</comment>Take it - it's interesting, it's not much work, and the tests are more than doable.  Prof Cohen is also interesting in lecture, section is flexible in terms of recording attendance (can chat with TF for five minutes and get out of it but it's good)</comment>Easy to forget you're enrolled in this class</comment>This class is fairly easy and you will learn cool things. Be warned that the final is harder than the midterm!</comment>This course exposes students to most of the Hebrew Bible.  However, the course has strong Jewish and modern slant.  The translation used of the Hebrew Bible is significantly different from other common translations (e.g. King James) and key words are translated in ways which support the Jewish interpretation of the Bible (e.g. "young woman" instead of "virgin"). 
     In addition, the course claims to allow students to choose any interpretation along the spectrum from Modern Bible Scholars to Traditionalists.  However, in fact, the course and professor strongly support the Modern Bible Scholar approach.  While interesting academically, this approach involves many claims which contradict key aspects of the religious and traditionalist approaches (e.g. whether the Bible is true, whether miracles actually happened).  In particular,  the essay questions on the exams are most easily answered by supporting the modern approach.  This presents a serious dilemma for students who wish to approach the Bible from a traditionalist or religious perspective: should they regurgitate beliefs contrary to their own to get a better grade?</comment>Take the class!! It is so interesting -- fascinating, really -- and Professor Cohen is a really incredible professor/lecturer and a very nice person. He really takes the time to get to know students. This was one of the top classes I have ever taken in my life.</comment>Will exceed expectations. I dreaded AIU/CB general education courses but found myself interested in the material taught in CB 39. Professor Cohen succeeds in designing a Gen Ed course, not a religion course that ensnares unprepared students (as most AIU/CB classes do).</comment>Its very fun.</comment>This is a great, accessible introduction to the Hebrew Bible and should be required for those who want a good understanding of Western cultural/religious traditions/origins. It's good if you haven't had any exposure to the Old Testament and want to read and understand some of the stories and also gain some knowledge about the way modern scholars study the bible. It's not too much work (~4 hours a week I'd say) so it's a good Gen Ed to take!</comment>I highly recommend this class!  Professor Cohen is excellent, and the course is very interesting.  Professor Cohen does an great job of surveying the Hebrew Bible in one semester, and we learned about the techniques used by modern biblical scholars when analyzing the bible.</comment>Take this class! If you've ever wanted to learn more about the Hebrew Bible this class will provide you with a great introduction. The readings are all very manageable, Professor Cohen is great, and the assignments are painless and very interesting. Professor Cohen says on the first day that he wants to help you get an A, and that really rang true throughout the course. You're provided with everything you need to know for the exams, which gives you more time to appreciate the texts you're reading and get as much out of them as you can.</comment>This is one of those classes that you walk away with knowledge that will be valuable to you 5, 10, 20 years down the road.  Overall, a great class.</comment>This course has a reputation for being easy, but you also learn a lot for the amount of time you put into it. I really enjoyed this course.</comment>This course is a fantastic gen ed if you want to fulfill CB. You learn a lot and it's not too difficult. The assignments really make you engage with the material. If you go to every lecture of skip all of them, no matter what, you will leave the class with a good understanding of the Hebrew Bible. It's designed in such a way that forces you to learn.</comment>This is an enjoyable class in which you will engage with the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament. It is not challenging per se, though you will be kept occupied and stimulated</comment>definitely take it if you have an interest in the bible!</comment>Be ready to do some reading (aka get ready to read a lot of the bible)</comment>Super easy. Super manageable. Take it from someone who never takes non-science/math classes</comment>This course is really good but you must stay with the material to understand the different material because there is a lot of different angles: different authors, different perspectives/religions, etc.</comment>This is a great class. If you're interested in gaining a working knowledge of the Bible and learning about biblical scholarship, this is the class for you. The readings from the Bible and from the textbook (Kugel) are never unnecessarily long or dull; the course provides an excellent survey that hits on the most interesting and relevant portions of the Bible. Furthermore, Professor Cohen is an awesome lecturer. He always keeps the material fun and interesting. I highly recommend this class.</comment>This class has a very high ratio of interesting things learned to time spent working. The lectures are interesting and engaging.</comment>This class is a gem! I strongly recommend it for anyone with a Jewish/Christian background. It will be easier for you because you're already familiar with the narrative and it will both supplement and challenge the way you view scripture in your faith.</comment>What you get out of the class is relative what you put into it.</comment>It is a great class in which you truly learn a lot</comment>Only take this class if you're interested in the material and will do the reading / are looking for an easy class. It's really easy to be not motivated because of some incredibly unmotivated people.</comment>It's a stress-free easy Gen-Ed that is also actually interesting.</comment>structure of the class is great - the 2 exam / 2 paper structure ensures that you learn the material, but offers a bit more flexibility than some other classes in terms of scheduling - great if you have a bunch of pset classes</comment>If you are looking for an easy yet interesting gen-ed, this one fulfills both those standards.</comment>Great class, really interesting, and absolutely worth taking.</comment>The learning-to-work ratio of this is unreal. It's not hard, but I learned so so much. One of the few classes where I loved doing the assignments and readings.</comment></course>US-WORLD 35: Dilemmas of Equity and Excellence in American K-12 Education</title>This class is definitely worth taking. If education policy doesn't interest you that much, you should still take it. Everyone should know how it works, and have the opportunity to take a class with Prof. Merseth, who is really a wonderful, wonderful woman. The class is made by the amazing teaching staff, and really only requires that you show up and do some thinking about the material. It is not meant to stress you out, but rather, to help you think critically about one of the most important, if not the most important, element of American society.</comment>This is one of the best classes I have taken at Harvard. If you lottery in, you have to take it (they are making it bigger next year so your chances will be better!). Professor Merseth is truly passionate about the dilemmas of public education in the U.S. both today and back through history, and the level of discussion that she sparks in lecture is both powerful and direly important. The class reminded me of the incredible diversity we have here at this school, both in terms of background and thought, and showed me the beauty of forming opinions by taking in a diverse set of ideas and beliefs. This is one of the only Ged Eds I've taken here that has made me want to go out into the world and take action on something that I care about. Also, the teaching team is out of this world so if you do end up getting into the class, take advantage of the awesome TFs.</comment>The entire teaching team is truly invested in you as an individual, and this class is worth taking precisely because of that.</comment>This is the only class I have been in in which I looked forward to coming to lecture every Tuesday and Thursday. This is the only class in which I have become really close to my entire section. Section involved discussions that weren't just performances for participation grades, but the conversations were about topics that we all genuinely cared about. Sometimes we would disagree, but I felt like I could share my own story, and my opinion was genuinely heard.</comment>It is a great class and definitely caused me to question and reconsider some of my opinions and thoughts regarding the education system. The class makes me feel excited and more prepared for conversations I'm going to have with people over the next couple of years about the fragmentation of our education system and actually know what I am talking about.   That being said, be prepared to spend a lot of time on this class. Kay also cold calls all of the time which can be uncomfortable.</comment>do all the readings for sure! or you will look dumb</comment>This class is one of the best at Harvard.  Professor Merseth and her teaching staff know what they're doing and execute class lectures, discussions, and sections with ease and passion.  The readings are difficult for a gen ed, and participation is a big part of this course, but the teaching team is understanding and helpful with people who are more shy and less likely to speak up in the large lecture setting.  The assignments and discourse, as well as the different activities completed in lecture and section were enlightening and interesting.  Lottery for this class if you're looking for a great gen ed that doesn't feel like a waste of your time!</comment>TAKE THIS COURSE. It is by far my favorite class at Harvard. You would never know it is a GenEd because you leave lecture twice a week with the chills. Kay is incredible. Just take it.</comment>US & World 35 is a gem in the General Education program that I would recommend to all students from various concentrations to take to enhance their awareness as a citizen of the inequities and aims for excellence in the American education system. It is a rare and invaluable experience to feel a part of an actual learning community that fosters communication with the professor, teaching fellows, course assistants, and peers.</comment>Take this course. Lottery for it again and again. It will change the way you look at how you've been educated, why you've been educated, and what's wrong with the system and how to approach the solution. Kay Merseth isn't going to let you just sit in the back of the classroom passively though. She's going to know your name, she's going to use it, and she's going to ask you why you think the way you do. This class is run in such an interactive and purposeful way that you wonder why you haven't been taught this way your whole life. I've learned to think more critically about all the factors that play into my education, and every TF is so great that I've really improved both the way I argue and analyze as well as the way I write.</comment>I haven't taken a gen ed class before, so I don't have a reference point, but I thought this was a challenging gen ed compared to most other gen eds</comment>Section was great, and TFs seemed to be carefully selected. My TF was not only well-prepared and well-versed in the material, but also unlike many other classes, actually a good teacher (may be a plus of getting people from the ed school who were former K-12 teachers themselves). The lecture itself was a little to discussion heavy for me, especially in a class that big. Because of the emphasis on discussion, we didn't spend that much time learning new material in class and I found this somewhat frustrating as I didn't feel like I learned enough during the semester. Be prepared for this, otherwise you may be a little disappointed.</comment>Best class ever.  If you lottery in, take it, and do all the readings.  You will learn so much about the American education system.  The lectures are incredibly engaging and I wish we had more time every lecture.  Prof. Merseth really cares about the students and the course, and it shows in how she runs the course.</comment>This course for me has been truly life-changing and eye-opening. I have always been interested in pursuing a career in education but this course has made this even more concrete for me. I greatly enjoyed gaining an insight into the history of US education and learning about the dilemmas and issues that still permeate the system today. Even if you aren't interested in a career in education, take this course. It will change your life.</comment>Great class. Prof. Merseth is awesome -- really cares about the students. Interesting material. Sometimes essays are frustrating but other than that, fantastic.</comment>Taking this course should be a requirement for all students. It is a humbling experience that will force you to evaluate your values and purpose. If you want to leave class baffled in the best possible way, then take this course.</comment>Get to know Professor Merseth. She is an incredible woman who cares about her students. That is rare at Harvard. Take this course just for her.</comment>The Q-guide and the selective lottery are not overhyped at all. I could sing of all of the praises about this course which deals with very relevent issues today, but it's not really necessary. There is a substantial amount of reading, but doing all of it helps you get more out of the course. Also, sign up for office hours as much as possible.</comment>I took this class as an elective, as a senior, and because I am interested in education. The teaching team is phenomenal. They care deeply that every student learns something and enjoys the experience. It is also an opportunity to get to know a passionate Professor (Kay Merseth) and supportive, challenging teaching team. You will learn about the historical origins of American education, the challenges faced in the past and today, and how issues of equity and excellence play out in education. If you want a USW or an elective that is interesting and inspiring, this is a great class. It is not easy to get an A on papers - even if you are the best writer in the world. They want you to "show improvement" a la expos and all. If you are looking for a flat A, this class might not be the best choice, but it certainly is more interesting than most others and so important to learn about. The class composition will shape the class - with enough passionate, engaged students, discussion can be outstanding. Without it, discussion might stagnate - leaving you to be frustrated or happily sitting on your computer in the back of the classroom. I would recommend this to students across grade levels but also recommend that you try to do some of the reading - you will learn more from the class than without it. 

tl;dr - the teaching team is phenomenal, material interesting and accessible, workload very minimal, and the students in the class influence lecture the most. definitely recommend.</comment>This is an amazing class. Take this class if you are genuinely interested in education in any way. While it may not be easy, you will walk out of the class feeling like you've learned something of great value, and it gives you an incredible perspective on education in your own life and in the nation. Get ready for it to challenge some of your views, in the best way.</comment>It's amazing but a lot of work</comment>The best class I've taken at Harvard. But you get out of it what you put into it. Do all the readings, not only because they're incredibly engaging and interesting, but because you will reap the benefits of a lively class discussion! But in all seriousness, it changed the way I think about American education, and made me interesting in becoming involved in education reform (I wasn't going into this course).</comment>KAY IS THE BEST PROFESSOR EVER! SHE TRULY CARES ABOUT HER STUDENTS AND SHE IS AMAZING! THE TFS ARE JUST AS AWESOME TO! TAKE THIS CLASS</comment>One of the best classes at Harvard. The TF, CA and Merseth are the best you'll find. No matter what you're concentration is this is a class you must take. It will make you question your beliefs on race, religion, money, opportunity, politics, and yourself. How has made you become who you are today? This previously cheesy question becomes very serious in USW 35 and you will be humbled by the end of the semester. Lottery this and you won't regret it.</comment>This class isn't easy, but it will make you think about education in a way you haven't before. If you stay on top of the readings, engage in discussion (though you should be aware that not all comments are equally valuable), and do the work, this class can be a valuable formative experience.</comment>This class has one of the best Q-scores for a reason.  It has an amazing and dedicated teaching staff, insightful material, and thought-provoking debates and discussions.  It will challenge your beliefs and ideals in the best way possible.  No interest in education necessary, just a general interest in the social forces that shape U.S. society.</comment>This class is absolutely amazing. The workload is a bit more than a regular gen ed class, but it's completely worth it. The topic is so interesting and complex, and I learned so much. Professor Merseth cares about each student, which just shows how much she cares about the class. Definitely take it if you have the chance!</comment>Take it</comment>This is one of the best classes that I have taken at Harvard and it is one of those classes that reminds you that you are in a special institution of higher learning. There are a lot of readings for the class, but they are all worth it, and the teaching team is incredibly motivated and engaged with the students. If anything, take this class just to get to know Prof. Merseth.</comment>Forget EC-10. Forget CS-50. Lottery for this course every semester, because it truly is a course that must be taken.</comment>Something that Professor Merseth stated at the beginning of the class goes something like this, "Education is the biggest civil rights issue of the 21st century." This class will show you exactly why that statement is probably the most valid you will hear during your time at Harvard. Education is tied to almost every other social and political structure the United States has today, and in order to understand our past, present, and future regarding equality, equity, and the well-being of our children, we MUST educate ourselves on the state of our education, and by discussing how we define excellence and equity is a very important first step in figuring out our own roles in this discussion.</comment>Stop reading the comments. Lottery for this class. If you get in, take it. No excuses. It will change your life. You won't regret it.</comment>This course is truly amazing. Coming from an engineering background, this opened my eyes to the purpose of education, and the challenges that are faced in the United States Education System. The teaching staff is great, and more committed to the class than any I've been in before. Definitely take this course if you can, but also be aware that there is a lot of reading assigned, which is expected to be completed. Additionally, the essays are very involved. Overall, one of the best courses I've taken at Harvard.</comment>This course is incredibly interesting (especially if you like education!) and you learn a ton just in a short semester. Great to take if it fills your USW Gen-Ed, but expect more work/engagement than a typical Gen-Ed course. There is a substantial amount of reading but it all mostly very interesting. The teaching staff is great, Prof. Merseth is amazing and so sweet, and they bring so much energy to the course week after week. My only negative experience with the course was the paper assignments and subsequent feedback we received by our TFs on these. I found it's very difficult to do well in this course (based on the way they grade) coming from someone who has a background and experience in education. Definitely take this course, maybe just Pass/Fail!</comment>Take this course!!! If you're looking for a gen ed to fulfill this requirement, do it. If you have any interest in education, take this for the best overview and understanding of the most prevalent issues in the system. If you have any interest in anything in American society, take this because you need to have a working knowledge of the things we go through in this class--ranging from topics on charter schools to education policy--to function in society.</comment>Professor Merseth is absolutely amazing - she works so hard to make this course what it is, and it shows. This class probably can't live up to the absurdly high expectations set for it, but it is definitely worth taking; I'm glad that I took it.</comment>Take this class. This is by far one of the best classes I have taken at Harvard. It is relevant to everyone, because we are all successful products of the education system but may not have thought about how our education system affects everyone in our nation. This class will cause you to question your educational experience and taken seriously the dilemmas of equity and excellence in our education system. I also believe that, as citizens, we should have an understanding of education reform policies and a stance on which levers of education reform are the most effective at maximizing both equity and excellence in our nation.</comment>I cannot recommend this course enough. Everything everyone says about Professor Merseth and the class environment she creates is ONE HUNDRED PERCENT TRUE. This was the best class I've taken at Harvard, I made some great friends in lecture and section, and most importantly, I learned a lot about the areas of our education system that desperately need improvement. Take this course—you won't know what you're missing if you don't.</comment></course>AFRAMER 188x: Contemporary Art in Africa : Proseminar</title>One of the best and most enjoyable courses I have taken at Harvard. Professor Blier actually teaches the material and engages with her students. Unlike many other professors, She doesn't just stand there and give llifeless lectures and except assignments. Instead, professor Blier wants to teach her students and wants them to learn the material. A wonderful semester.</comment>Professor Blier was the highlight of the course. Regardless of whether or not the class ended up discussing the week's readings, her comments on a variety of issues and the wealth of her experience were incredibly valuable. She also provided solid feedback on weekly assignments as well as the final paper. The class seemed disjointed at times, but this often led to equally interesting discussions regarding topics that fell outside the syllabus.</comment></course>CHEM 190: Statistical Mechanics in Chemistry and Biology</title>This course was the most challenging, yet most rewarding class I have ever taken--highly recommend to someone interested in statistical mechanics of chemical biology systems.</comment>This class is a ton of fun, and the quality of teaching is quite high. CHEM 190 is well worth the challenge it presents!</comment></course>PSY 1201: Your Brain on Drugs: Psychopharmacology</title>This class is really interesting, but the exams are extremely difficult and detailed. Don't get behind on the material.</comment>Take this course. Although having weekly quizzes is a hassle, this class is worth it. Professor Lukas is absolutely amazing and is like watching a show every single time. Everything you learn is useful, but you will have to memorize a lot of details. The final was brutal, but don't really know how it will be graded.</comment>Professor Lukas is absolutely excellent, and the material is useful.</comment>So much rote memorization...</comment>Keep on top of the material for the quizzes, and make sure to really know the details for exams. Tests are generally pretty fair though!</comment>If for no other reason, take this to meet Dr. Lukas and learn the mastery of rockstar lecturing.</comment>Great course and I learned a lot.</comment>Super interesting and Dr. Lukas is hilarious! It is a lot of information to learn but it is all very relevant.</comment>It is extremely difficult and there's no guidance when taking the tests.</comment>This class is super interesting--you learn a lot about a lot of different drugs.  Being able to draw comparisons across drug classes is very useful especially if you are thinking of medicine.  Dr. Lukas is also a phenomenal lecturer.</comment>Definitely not as focused on the pharmacology as the name might suggest. There is a much greater focus on the sociological impact of drug use, rather than the biological effects. There is a lot of mindless memorization, since a lot of topics are very disconnected and there isn't a logical flow.</comment>I thoroughly enjoyed this class. Professor Lukas is a great lecturer and the course material is interesting. The only warning that I might have to someone taking this class is that the weekly quizzes can sometimes be obnoxious. While they are very fair and based on the couple previous lectures, it just can be a pain to have to worry about a quiz each week. Otherwise, I thought this was a great class and I'm very happy that I took it, as I learned a lot without too much stress or work.</comment>just listen in class</comment>The material is interesting and it is not too much work.</comment>This class is great. You learn a lot in a short time and it really is useful in everyday life and the teaching staff does a great job explaining the implications that the material has.</comment>This course would be most useful if you have lots of time to dedicate to memorizing every detail on every lecture slide. The information is interesting and useful, but it isn't clear what midterms or quizzes will cover, so be prepared to memorize everything.</comment>This is one of the best courses I have ever taken at Harvard and the Professor is without a doubt the best lecturer I’ve had at Harvard. Yes, there are a fair amount of details, but Prof. Lukas does a phenomenal job of tying what would otherwise bet dry neuroscience and psychology to real life examples and continues to show w
hy it’s important that everyone has this understanding. This is the single best pre-med course I have ever taken in that it really synthesizes both the science and humanity of medicine.</comment>Incredible lectures, Good exams & mediocre TF's. Take the class, you only have section 1hour a week and you can sleep through it.</comment>Professor Lukas is one of THE best professors I've ever had. He makes the material interesting and manageable. Hands down the best course I've taken yet. Weekly quizzes (not too challenging) keep you on top of the material so when it comes time for the midterm and final it's not too overwhelming.</comment>it's really cool but also difficult</comment>Good course.</comment>It's a fantastic, fun course that isn't too demanding!  Really sparked my interest in pharmacology!</comment>Dr. Lukas's teaching style was distracting from the actual material. There was far too much material covered in each lecture to possibly know what was important for the exams and quizzes.</comment>Take it!</comment>Great introductory class to behavioral pharmacology. There's a lot of material thrown at you each class, but Professor Lukas is really funny and makes every lecture fun. Keep in mind that sections are based on class discussion on a weekly research paper - you don't to go over lecture material, so consider dedicating some time outside of class to go over the things learnt by yourself. This will be very helpful come the midterm and final exam.</comment>While the content is really comprehensive and engaging, testing can be frustating because certain annoying facts are considered just as important as psychodynamic processes. Don't expect to just understand the neurobio- know how many people smoke in the U.S., or why body builders use diuretics. Can be odd, but over all i left this course with more applicable knowledge than a lot of the gen - eds.</comment>Take this class if you are as interested in brain chemistry and pharmacology as you are about the social aspects of addiction --- I would say the class is 75% anatomy/physiology</comment>Seems like its an awesome course to take... but they absolutely bone you for the final.  Tells you its way less information than it really becomes.  1/3 of the class didn't finish a 3 hour final</comment>You don't need the book. At all.</comment>I loved this class!  Lots of content, but so interesting and Prof. Lukas is so entertaining!  I took this as a Neuro elective and enjoyed it as one of my most interesting/enjoyable classes this semester.  Painless and great way to fill neuro elective!</comment>This class was conducted in an absolutely brilliant manner. Lukas gives fascinating hilarious lectures and section is filled with extremely interesting papers. As a student interested in becoming a future psychiatrist, I can say that this class was the most fascinating class that I have ever taken, and will stay with me forever. I think everyone should take this class because drugs and alcohol are so relevant to college student's lives and it is absolutely critical to be properly educated on the subject. While the final was challenging, the quizzes and midterm were a breeze, but I am a neurobiology concentrator, so this is why I would be careful taking the class unless you have a psych or neurobio background.</comment>If you are at all interested in drugs of any sort, recreational or prescription, this will give you the straight facts without any BS. Professor Lukas is a great lecturer and you will come out of the class having learned a lot. Make sure to pay attention in class and you will do fine on all the quizzes and exams, it will be easier than trying to come back to the lecture slides to study</comment>This class makes for an excellent neuro elective. Lukas is awesome and Dr. Puhl is really chill. It requires a decent amount of memorization, but if you make a short outline of the major facts for each drug (metabolism, mechanism of action, route of administration, patterns of use, etc.) throughout the semester, studying for the midterm and final will be a LOT easier seriously do it.</comment>One of my favorite Psychology courses at Harvard. I would highly recommend anyone interested even remotely in the material presented to take this class. Dr. Lukas is an amazing lecturer and both section leaders are awesome too. Lectures are entertaining and engaging so it's easy to pay attention. Don't worry about PSY 18 as a pre-req, you can take this class with only knowledge from SLS 20.</comment>All memorization. Lukas is a funny lecturer, but the material is just so dry when you have to sit down, literally memorize details from 21 lectures, and then basically not need them except for a few details on the midterm and final. Such ridiculous, nit-picky grading "You did not give me one sentence per each question. Therefore, minus 5."  Interesting material, but man, such pointless lecture slides half the time, and so many hours of memorization to forget it all a few days later.</comment>This class is fantastic! Dr Lukas is hilarious, and his teaching style will definitely keep you awake and engaged in the material. Moreover, the material taught in this class is fascinating and (when it comes to nicotine, alcohol, and marihuana) highly relevant. The debate project is really fun. This was a great way to check off one of my neuro requirements -- take it and you won't regret it.</comment>Great class to fill a neuro requirement; low workload, great professor, interesting material; Lukas is an amazing lecturer and makes the class</comment>Really hard tests but very interesting topic and engaging professor.</comment>This is a fantastic course and a great way to explore the way drugs affect the body and mind. I imagine this class will end up being useful to me in academic, clinical, personal, and many other fields of life.</comment>Lukas is a fantastic lecturer, regardless of how interesting the material is. You will learn a lot, but mostly from lecture and review/studying for quizzes. Section is of limited benefit.</comment>It's a great course with an awesome professor. Take it!</comment>An interesting class for anyone considering going into medicine. Lukas is a great teacher and you will learn a lot from this class.</comment>This class sounds much more interesting than it really is. While Professor Lukas is a great lecturer, the content of the lectures is not as interesting as I thought it would be. Professor Lukas assumes a lot of prior knowledge, and doesn't really go in depth explaining the different mechanisms in which the brain is affected by drug intake. The Professor bases a lot of his claims on his own research, making very little reference to studies from the 21st century. The lecture slides aren't structured in a coherent way, rather need to be deciphered to be understood. The TFs have 0 interest in the students, and the section component doesn't give you a better understanding of the material since it's article-based and doesn't give room for asking questions.</comment></course>CLAS-STDY 130: History and Fiction in European Literature: from Late Antiquity to the Renaissance</title>This is a fantastic course into a little explored subject area. Looking at literary production from the late antique and medieval period is a fascinating excercise. You will read texts from a multitude of genre, produced in very different regions and contexts. Professor Leonte gives historical background, so you will understand Byzantium a lot better by the end of the course too.</comment></course>VIETNAM 120a: Intermediate Vietnamese</title>The subject itself is very interesting, and the readings we receive are a trove of knowledge for both culture and history of Vietnam. Professor Binh adds a lot of very interesting and insightful anecdotes and lessons alongside these readings, and it's clear that he's deeply knowledgable about Vietnamese language, history and culture. However, it's extremely difficult to speak out in class sometimes, because sometimes he snaps for no reason, and on other days, he's perfectly accommodating. It's hard to tell when I'm going to be frowned upon greatly for not knowing something and when he'll breeze onward and tell me what I'm missing. It's very unpredictable, and there were many times I felt highly uncomfortable speaking out in class because I was unsure if he'd sigh, take off his glasses, and give me this look that described how much of a huge disappointment I was for getting something wrong. Oftentimes, I felt it was either I needed to know for sure or not speak at all and run the risk of being wrong—and that is not the type of mood that should be facilitated in a learning environment, especially one regarding a new language.</comment>If you want to learn Vietnamese, definitely take this course. We learned so much more than just the language, and the professor is very knowledgeable about all aspects of Vietnam. However, to enjoy this course, you must be really committed to learning the language and work hard.</comment></course>PHYSICS 140: Introduction to the Physics of Living Systems</title>Great course on biophysics. I really liked the small class size and the ability to interact with the professor closely. Section is very helpful, especially when it comes to doing the psets, which were very hard. The professor is very approachable and friendly. The physical problems we studied were fascinating and relevant to the student of biology. The textbook is a bit frustrating--it makes logical leaps that it doesn't explain and the math is not always precise. It's a good idea to review Fourier math and distribution statistics or some problems will look very foreign to you.</comment>This course presents material - and, more importantly, a way of thinking - that is essential to any aspiring biologist, or even to anyone who wants to understand biology at a level that is not totally superficial. After progressing through the standard MCB courses, this course was like a breath of fresh air -- finally I was actually encouraged to think quantitatively about biology, instead of being forced to memorize so-called "principles" that had no physical or quantitative underpinnings!  This course is worthwhile, but not easy - and you get out what you put into it. Lectures are very mathematically dense, and it can be overwhelming, but it is truly worth your while to take good notes and review them later to walk yourself through the math if you couldn't follow during the lecture. The problem sets are similarly mathematically intensive, so you'll have to deal with some of the nitty-gritty math at some point. Even if you're not particularly interested in learning about the mathematics behind the results, though, the big-picture change in thinking that this course effects by presenting strikingly simple physical models that can be fruitfully applied to biology makes it worth it.</comment>This course was offered for the first time this year in a while, so in some senses it still feels "under construction". But I think it has tremendous potential, since its emphasis on physics gives you a new way of thinking about biological problems that you will not see anywhere else. Strongly recommended for any aspiring biophysicist, especially who is interested in the molecular/cellular level. Less of an emphasis on systems bio.</comment>This class has potential, but isn't quite there yet. The book we used was quite good, and most of the problem sets were manageable. However, lectures need some work. We usually would spend an hour and a half going through a complicated proof that wouldn't relate at all to any of the material on the pset.</comment>Although you could learn all the material by just reading the textbook, you know that you probably don't have the discipline to do that. So take the course.</comment>If you want a good knowledge of the math that drives physical processes then this course is perfect for you.  If you want a broad understanding of many macroscopic processes then look elsewhere - this is microscopic math, not kinesiology.</comment>Take it for the professor, even if you're not sure that you're interested in the material! Aravi is funny, laid-back, and a great professor.</comment>This class presents very interesting material, although it was a bit disorganized this year since this was the first year it was taught. Dr. Samuel is an amazing professor who really cares that every student learns the material. Take classes he teaches!</comment></course>PHYSICS 191r: Advanced Laboratory</title>This class is very demanding, pick a good lab partner and work hard and early.</comment>This course is definitely a challenge, and will require a lot of additional research and reading. For that reason, however, you will also be sure to learn a lot and feel a sense of accomplishment upon completing the course. Also, the instructors are more than willing to help you if you ask, and they can provide some amazing insights and tips.</comment></course>SOC-WORLD 14: The British Empire</title>Great class if interested in the empire at all, notice it requires a fair share of work every week - for section but also just in terms of assignments - there is quite a lot of them</comment>Jasanoff is one of those professors who tells you a story instead of lectures you. From the moment you come into the lecture hall to the moment you leave, you will find yourself immersed in fantastical journeys from the West to the East of many British Empire's explorers, generals, missionaries etc. Her enthusiasm and passion for B.E.'s history is moving.</comment>Jasanoff is an amazing lecturer - worth it just for the lectures.</comment>You will know exactly what you're getting with this course: it's transparent, interesting, and the professor is an amazing lecturer. The digital assignments are the only confusing part of the coursework, and questions about those can be answered if you reach out to your TF. Overall, I loved it!</comment>good class but a good amount of work for a gen ed</comment>If you take this course do not expect a traditional history course, outlining the development of the British Empire. While it is a good gened and is very interesting it is more of a highlights of the British Empire, focusing on a few very specific things.</comment>It's a great class that is honestly one of the best I've taken at Harvard. The workload isn't too brutal, and you learn a ton.</comment>We called SW14 "Story Time with Maya" in the best way possible. If you know a lot about British imperial history, it may be painful sometimes to oversimplify topics you really care about. That said, even if you do know something (or a lot) about the partition of India or Trevelyan and the Irish Potato Famine, Prof. Jasanoff is worth learning from. The workload is super manageable, too. Read the primary sources -- they are the most fun (and most useful for papers and exams).</comment>Dr Jasanoff is an amazing professor; you will never fall asleep in class.</comment>This is an interesting course with great readings and lectures. The workload was very manageable and most of the assignments felt worthwhile.</comment>This course is an excellent GenEd! It may not be the easiest course, workload wise, but the lectures and course material are very interesting. I looked forward to each lecture, something I haven't experienced with any other lecture class thus far. Maya Jasanoff is an engaging lecturer with interesting anecdotes, and section leaders were all really great.</comment>This class is very boring. Unless overly dramatic lectures are you thing, stay away.</comment>Interesting class but run like a high school course with silly assignments and work.</comment>Very interesting, great class. Surprising amount of work though, definitely is not low workload.</comment>This is not an easy Gen ed! Take with caution. It is a really interesting course 9especially with Jasanoff lectures, she's on point) but only if you're willing to put a lot of time in, which frankly I was not given my workload.</comment>This is a pretty solid Gen-Ed.  There's a noticeable ideological bias, but the readings balance that out somewhat.</comment>Maya Jasanoff is a fantastic professor, and does a great job of giving a survey of the British Empire. The readings are all carefully selected and interesting, but not extensive. The assignments are not your typical history papers, which can make them challenging as it can be tough to know what is wanted. This is also a gen ed class, so sections are massive, so don't expect to be able to have a productive discussion.</comment>Good Gen-Ed</comment>Lectures are very repetitive and boring. Not much work and some interesting readings and essays. Tests are pretty easy.</comment>A good course heavily invested in the British Empire. It is impersonal at times. If you want to hide in the crowd this is a good course for you.</comment>SW 14 is by no means a "gem" gen ed - there are 3 digital exercises, lots of reading a week, 3 essays, and 2 hour-long exams, so this class ended up being quite a bit more work than I expected. That being said, it was one of my favorite classes at Harvard. Jasanoff is an entertaining lecturer. If you're a history buff you might think that the lectures in this course are too much "pop history," lots of interesting anecdotes about certain events/people in the history of the British Empire, but I was entertained by the lectures in this class. What really made the class great for me was the section component. Tara was an amazing TF and I always felt that helpful blend of pressure and enjoyment of section, and this motivated me to stay on top of the readings and engage with the material. Writing essays for this class was also helpful for my progress as a writer in general - Tara gave great feedback. Overall had a great time taking this class even though it surprised me when it became one of my most intense classes this semester.</comment>The readings are really interesting. Prof. Jasanoff is an incredible lecturer, you will never want to miss a class. 
Sections can be hard when people aren't as enthused, but the class is easy enough if you put in some time and effort. Nothing is a surprise and it is very fair; you get what you put in.</comment>This is one of the best classes I have ever taken at Harvard. If you need to fulfill an SW, take this one. Maya Jasanoff is amazing and so engaging as a lecturer. The things you learn in this class are so important to understand how to world was shaped today, because it covers everything from the East India Company to the Mau Mau in Kenya. It helps fill in the gaps in our understanding of current events. There are a lot of assignments, but they are easy to manage and some are actually fun. I found them helpful for understanding the course material better in preparation for midterms--which were also very fair when you study. Do the readings! They come up in midterms and are important for understanding the course.</comment>Great class! Lectures are organized, reasonable workload for a Gen Ed.  Don't need any previous knowledge on British Empire.</comment>This class is extremely interesting and engaging. It requires a lot of reading but the material and lectures are fascinating.</comment>This is by far one of the most interesting courses at Harvard. Jasanoff is an unbelievable lecturer. However, some section leaders are stronger than others and there is a huge grading disparity between sections.</comment>incredible crash course on the british empire- but it felt like with each week, you were focusing on very specific, nuanced facets to the empire. so a crash course, but you were really able to delve into great detail and analysis with each part of the always changing empire.</comment>lectures are great, but sections are really dull.  pretty heavy workload for a gened.</comment>If you are interested in history this class is brilliant. The lectures are entertaining and nearly like watching a mystery story. If you want to participate in sections, you have to do the readings which can be time consuming. You have to but some efforts in the class, but its very interesting to engage with class materials and also the assignments are fun. Also this class provides you with a fairly good overview of history of the past three centuries.</comment>This was a great class for my first semester. The lectures and readings were awesome and interesting, and not a lot of pressure in terms of coursework while still also learning a lot.</comment>Best intro history class out there</comment>Great class to fulfill SW with, you learn a lot about the recent history of the world and how things ended up how they are today (not just within the British Empire but also worldwide, since it impacted so much). Jasanoff is a great public speaker and always prepares well for class, you can tell she's passionate about the material and about the class.</comment>This was a decent class. You learn quite a bit about the British Empire, although important episodes like the Napoleonic Wars are completely omitted in favor of talking about Jumbo the Elephant for half a lecture. Some of the readings are long, boring, and pointless, but you don't really need to do them to succeed in the course. Section is the usual combination of 1-2 Section Kids who read everything and try to suck up to the TF and 12-15 people who skimmed the readings and make up BS; it's utterly pointless.</comment>Interesting, enjoyable and informative class but quite a lot of work for a gen-ed.</comment>Be prepared to learn a lot in this class, but don't worry about being overwhelmed. Maya is so interesting in lecture and the class has excellent organization. The workload is spread out well over the course of the semester so this class should be considered even if you have a busy schedule. The grading is very fair, though it may vary depending on which TF you have.</comment>It was more difficult than most Gen Eds, which I didn't expect.</comment>AMAZING lecture. So great. and the readings are all very interesting. There is kind of a lot of work (in terms that you're writing an essay every other week) but seriously not that bad and it's completely worth it.</comment>Lectures are wonderful.</comment>This course gives you a structured framework to understanding recent history and how the British Empire influenced the modern world.  You will quickly realize the transient nature of world superpowers and how we (Americans) can learn from the rise and fall of the British Empire.  Plus, Professor Jasanoff is the most amazing lecturer you will ever have.  This class is truly epic.</comment>Great class, lecture material is great. Able to get through this class without much work but doing well in essays and exercises is also rewarding. Midterm and final are well-structured but require revision of key events and figures in history. Good history class for a non-humanities concentrator but also enjoyed by History students.</comment>This is a very interesting course.  I would say the reading material is very good, some of the best I have ever had for a history course, if not a bit too much at times.  Jasanoff gives orderly, interesting lectures.  Sometimes she tells a few too many stories, when I would have liked to hear a bit more synthesis or big picture connections, but overall she is a great lecturer.  Get Mircea as your TF if you can, he is wonderful.

Take the class if you are interested in the history of the British Empire.  Know that there is a good amount of work.  Most weeks you have at least an assignment to do for the class.</comment>The British Empire will provide you with lessons about colonialism and its impact on the world today.</comment>This is a solid class if you're looking to fulfill a Gen Ed requirement. The lectures are very interesting and the work is fairly easy. Make sure to look at the syllabus before signing up for it because the essays and digital assignments are more work than you might think. Overall an engaging and not particularly difficult SW class.</comment>Take this course if you are interested in history or empires or Britain. I took this class concurrently with ER 32, and it was a great complementary class. This time around there was consistently about an assignment (blog post / essay / exam) per week, so you will be consistently assessed in this class. Personally I felt my TF was a tougher than usual grader on the essays (compared to other Gen eds I have taken), so this class definitely requires above average work than other Gen Eds but is quite rewarding.</comment>Such an amazing class! Prof Jasanoff may be one of the best professors I've had at Harvard. She makes every lecture interesting, engaging, and SO important in our understanding of the basis of the economy and societies of today. The work is consistent but not super difficult. No matter what discipline you're in, this class is relevant to your life as a person on this world today. Take it!!</comment>This course is not a walk-in-the-park... which would be fine if it didn't feel like a bit of a waste of time.  But Societies of the World....</comment>Great class, very interesting history course. You get out what you put in. Jasanoff is a great lecturer.</comment>It teaches you about the world. With enough enthusiasm, you'll learn much more than what's written in the syllabus</comment>The history of the British Empire is fascinating and Professor Jasanoff does a good job of drawing connections between the Empire and our lives in 21st-century America to make what she teaches more meaningful. She also shows how many of the issues the world grapples with today are legacies of the Empire, and provides a balanced view of this controversial form of government. The course can sometimes feel like "greatest hits" of the British Empire -- depth is sometimes sacrificed for breadth -- but such is the nature of a one-semester course on such a vast subject. Professor Jasanoff is one of the best lecturers I have had at Harvard: she communicates clearly and so eloquently, clearly laying out her arguments before marshaling evidence to convince you of them. She is also humorous and engaging and has a flair for storytelling. I always enjoyed going to lecture. If you weren't already convinced, this course will demonstrate that it is so important to learn about the British Empire if one wants to make sense of today's international politics.</comment>The class requires a strong commitment to reading and writing assignments and is extremely rewarding.</comment>Really fantastic course.  Dr. Jasanoff is the most excellent lecturer I've had at Harvard and class is a pleasure to attend.  The material is very interesting and one learns loads about the British and their impact on the world.</comment>Great course, not too challenging, but very engaging. Would strongly recommend to anyone.</comment>It's an incredible class and it changed the way I see the world. It put my life into a relation with current events (the fighting in Iraq, Afghanistan, Israel and Palestine), which is something I have not felt before.</comment>This is a great class to take if you are interested in the British Empire and its history. Due to the large volume of material under that heading, the course can only really scratch the surface, so if you are interested in greater detail you might take a different course. Nevertheless, you can learn a lot in this course and develop your own depth through the exercises and papers, and Jasanoff is a good lecturer.</comment>There are a lot of small assignments - almost one every week - so you'll need to manage your time. 
Lectures are awesome and are where you do most of the learning- try to go to lecture.</comment>Lectures are very interesting, there are fewer readings now but they are also more mandatory as almost all of them are covered in section and on the exams. Take notes in class and keep up with the readings and you'll do fine. Make sure to go to office hours if you aren't good with writing papers, that helps a lot</comment>Be prepared for essays that are graded with extremely high standards.</comment>The class is a decent amount of work and you should do the readings to get the most out of the class. Also, go to lecture because Jasanoff is an unbelievably engaging and interesting lecturer--definitely one of the best, if not the best, I've had here at Harvard.</comment>I would highly recommend this course for anyone interested in the subject matter. If you have some background in writing history, you will have a very easy time. If not, it's a reasonable GenEd.
Prof. Jasanoff's lectures are spectacular and the readings are fascinating. In general, the course gives a very good overview of British imperial history and I feel I have a much broader understanding of the interplay between various events, as well as general trends.
The assignments are very balanced: there are 3 digital assignments (blogpost, timeline, podcast), all of which are a fun way to engage with a topic of your choice. There are 3 5-page long essays, pretty standard. There are also two midterms testing the general understanding (1 hour, 4 IDs, 2 essays), which I found quite fair.
Overall, I can't think of a better way of meeting a GenEd and I would recommend it even to history concentrators - it's fun and interesting, even though you might not be as challenged as you'd like.</comment>I really enjoyed Professor Jasanoff's lectures in this class! A good gen ed.</comment>Be prepared to do a decent amount of writing.</comment>This is a great class on imperialism and you will learn a lot. The grading is a little tough though, and the readings are quite long. The readings are very important though. Overall, you'll learn quite a bit and a great Gen. Ed class for SW.</comment>Useful if you are looking for a very broad, general overview of one of the biggest Empires in the hsitory of our race. The prof is very funny and the assignments are fun to do. The readings do not take too much time and are very interesting.</comment>Professor Jasanoff's lectures like she is telling a story. She keeps you engaged throughout the hour and obviously has thought a lot about how to make this course accessible to as many students as possible, no matter their concentration. Take this course before you graduate!</comment>This is a textbook 'easy GenEd.' If you want a pretty mindless class that you don't get a lot out of, but demands very little, this is the class for you. But if you want a class where you'll actually learn something, look elsewhere.</comment>Lots of work, but you learn a lot.</comment>Professor Jasanoff and the TFs are very thoughtful about this class. They put in an extreme amount of effort to make this class really conducive to the students taking it, and it induces a great learning environment within and outside of class.</comment>This is a great gen-ed! The lectures are interesting and engaging, the workload is light, and it's an overall great course. I loved learning about the history of the British Empire, and everyone in the course is extremely helpful.</comment>Really interesting material, but a decent amount of work!</comment>It is my absolute favorite class that I have taken at Harvard.</comment>You get back as much as you put in. It has potential to be very interesting as long as you go to lecture because Professor Jasanoff is so charismatic and knowledgable</comment>I really enjoyed this class. The readings were great, and I learned a ton of "cocktail facts." Jasanoff is a great professor. A really awesome option!</comment>Class material is great, but it seems like some TF's grade much harder than others.</comment>Kinda busy. Not too gemmy, but we will see how the grading is. Definitely depends on your TF. Midterms were pretty simple, papers a little different though</comment>Great class, with good TFs and great lectures. There is a fair amount of consistent work (weekly  reading and short papers/assignments) but nothing ever piles up!</comment>ALOT of reading. But very manageable and interesting topics.</comment>It is a great class but sometimes the content veers from historical detail to sensationalism. The lectures can be slightly tedious. However, the readings and primary source documents are great as well the sections are entertaining. I just wish there were not so many short papers.</comment>n/a</comment>Maya Jasanoff's lectures are as engaging as everyone has said. She makes the one hour seem way too short (although oftentimes it actually is too short) for class. The readings are really great. My only complaint would be that covering The British Empire starting from the 18th century to mid 20th century is really ambitious for one semester, so it sometimes does seem like the class isn't doing the actual history justice.</comment>Decent amount of work compared to some gen eds, but fairly easy to keep up with.  Overall worthwhile class</comment>Maya Jasanoff is an amazing lecturer. She keeps you spellbound. Take a class from her before you graduate.</comment></course>ECON 1010a: Microeconomic Theory</title>The lectures are terrible, but if you get a good section leader it can be a good class.</comment>Basically self-study</comment>Only take this is if you're thinking about concentrating in Economics. It's wildly boring and doesn't connect with relevant and interesting themes in Economics.</comment>This class is awful, but you gotta do it for ec.</comment>Take this course only if you absolutely need to.</comment>Do the psets even if they aren't graded! If you can teach yourself well, read the textbook rather than attend lecture. This class is a stepping stone to many topics beyond - and intermediate economics will be dry before the fun stuff that follows!</comment>If you have a choice of getting dipped in caustic acid or taking this course, I implore you to choose the former. It is by far the worst class I've taken at Harvard. Miron clearly hates teaching it, and if the leader of the class hates it, then clearly the students will hate it as well. Don't think I'm alone in this opinion. I haven't heard a single good thing about this class from anyone. It needs serious revamping. I absolutely abhorred this class.</comment>This isn't a good class, which is really disappointing because microeconomics can actually be really interesting. Lecture is dull and confusing and section is completely useless (if you even go), so you end up having to teach yourself all the material. The exams look nearly identical to the optional problem sets, so do the problem sets. Miron gets really excited when he talks about drug legalization, but otherwise lecture is monotonous. This class is also more like a math course than like an economics course: you don't learn any theory beyond what was already covered in Ec10a, but you do learn the math behind these models.</comment>This class is not engaging on any level.  The lectures and sections were not helpful at all, and the readings were often confusing and more complicated than the exam material.</comment>Only take this course if you are an Economics concentrator. This course is terribly structured, the curve on exams is terrible, and Miron doesn't seem to care about what he is teaching. I don't think I actually learned anything in this course.</comment>You should take this class over Ec10 if you have any economics knowledge. I'm talking bare minimum. You'll learn the material if you go to section. Lecture? Now that's a different story. Lecture has nothing, and I mean nothing, to do with the PSET. It DOES help you see the practical application of microeconomics, but attending lecture won't give you an A. That being said, go to at least one. Miron is a interesting guy, so it's not like you'll be bored. Regarding section, GO TO IT LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT. It is immensely key to your success. By success, I don't mean getting an A; you'll get that if you go, but you'll actually enjoy the learning process if you learn the material from a TA.</comment>It's not great but it isn't horrible. It's not a huge workload and very doable. It also enables you to take a lot of cool higher level ec classes. So if it's a requirement definitely take it and don't worry too much.</comment>Take the class if it's a requirement.  The minimal amount of work makes it fairly painless, especially as lectures/sections/psets/everything is optional.  But don't expect to get anything out of it whatsoever.</comment>Please do not waste your time with this class. You will not learn anything.</comment>Really terrible class. Don't expect to learn much. That said, you can put in a very low amount of work and do fine. If you have to take it, you will survive.</comment>The median grade for our exams were crazy high. We had an exam where you couldn't miss a question to make an A (re: perfect score). Also, the problem sets were optional, yet anywhere between 3-6 problem set questions were on every midterm...verbatim. This class is weird.</comment>Just take the class. Not the best but useful and Miron is engaging and interesting.</comment>This class deserves its reputation.  For many ec or applied math concentrators it is a required class and much more manageable than the alternative ec 1011.  However be prepared to be terribly bored and feel that the material and skills you are tested on are very disconnected from what is covered in lecture and the textbook.  Great sophomore fall class as it is possible to get by cramming for the midterms and putting very little effort into the class otherwise.  This class is not a gem by any means but in terms of workload is the best bad option.</comment>The reason I've passed this class is from Ec10a and Math 1a last year. I did not learn new material this semester and had to figure out how to apply the concepts on my own.</comment>The material is interesting, but the presentation isn't the best. Take the class nonetheless because the material is useful and powerful.</comment>The tests for this class are directly off the p-sets.</comment>take it for the concentration. the class is very sink or swim, and if you don't have the head TF and are passive about getting help, you can be at a strong disadvantage. lectures are not critical and often just going through confusing derivations of equations (which you will never be tested on) with weird notations, so don't be stressed out if you didn't understand lecture. the course's tf staff needs to improve a lot as well. students often complain about section leaders not knowing how to do problems efficiently, digressing, etc. the exams and psets were relatively easy, almost deceptively though because the final turned out to be extremely difficult and tricky</comment>Unless required, probably want to skip this one.</comment>It is a class you have to take, so you have to take it.</comment>This course was altogether very unfulfilling. The entire grade on the course was based on five multiple-choice exams. The first four midterms were 15 questions each, and the final had around 30 questions. This makes up your entire grade for the courses--which many students felt was a very poor assessment of their microeconomic knowledge. None of the problem sets are graded, because they were all multiple choice! There was no incentive to stay up-to-date with the course, and it felt like the teaching staff as very uninvested in the success of the students. Miron begins the course by saying that the class will be boring--well of course the class will be boring if it's the mindset going in. The textbook was actually quite interesting--it's entirely possible to make this class engaging. 1010a was not. If you can stomach the math, 1011a is recommended. 10a taught me so much more econ than this class did.</comment>The material is interesting but can get pretty dry. Exams are tricky because they are all multiple choice.</comment>Stay on top of everything.  It is easy to neglect doing ec homework because the psets are easy, but do it for the tests.  Also, it is important to understand the math as you go along.  The math builds, so it is important to know how everything relates.</comment>If this were an elective, I would not recommend it to anyone who is not genuinely interested in economics because it is very dry.</comment>It's not a lot of work, but you still have to study for tests because the curve was pretty harsh given the MC format of all of the assessments.</comment>This class felt like an independent study. The problem sets were not too difficult and the structure allowed you to do the work when you deemed necessary. The freedom and hands off nature of this course however came at the cost of many being disengaged. I learned more about study habits from this test then the actual material. Solving these problems can actually be very fun, but from the first day the class was portrayed as being boring and taxing which had a negative effect on people's attitude about the course going into it.</comment>This semester there were 4 midterms (with 15/16 multiple choice questions on each midterm) and a final of 34 multiple choice questions. The midterms aren't too bad, make sure you go to section since they actually cover the test material, but the final was BRUTAL since it's a lot of material and there were several questions that were foreign to me. Make the final a priority!!! Pretty sure it's going to kick my grade in the butt :(</comment>This class is a lot of self-learning, and Miron definitely does not want to be teaching. If you are to take this class, make sure to go to a TF's section that actually understands the material and is willing to explain the problem sets to you.</comment>Midterms were extremely easy if you look at the problem sets, but the final was extremely hard. You don't have to go to lecture, so I'd suggest doing the readings and going to section. Your whole grade is based on 96 multiple choice questions...</comment>Consider knowing Ec10 very well before taking this class</comment>This is a requirement for Econ concentrators. You have to take it. It's not interesting material, but it is necessary.</comment>The course is good if you want a better foundation in the principles of economics and want to learn how to apply univariate calculus to economic problems. The midterms are fairly straightforward, so much so that it is not uncommon for students to score perfect scores on them. This means you really have to be on top of the problem set questions and concepts, which the midterms are based off, in order to get a good grade. The final was terribly unfair and did not accurately represent what we had covered in class or in the problem sets. Make sure you really understand the concepts and the mathematical relationships of economic principles if you want to do well on the final. Overall, the class is good to better your economic foundation, but you're really going to have to strive for perfection (literally) in order to get an A.</comment>Lectures are not taught great but this class is necessary for economics concentrators. Section is definitely worth going to and problem sets are a must.</comment>Unless this class changes, it is one of the worst classes you can take at Harvard.</comment>Fun</comment>Unfortunately, for Ec concentrators, this class is a requirement.  The one thing I will say is that this course prepares you to think like an economist and forces you to use intuition because there is nothing (like, absolutely nothing, between abstruse textbooks and poorly-run lectures) that will support you through this. That said, the material isn't too difficult at all, and the gems of economic theory that you can scrape from the answers of the p-sets make the course bearable, at least somewhat.</comment>The only reason you should ever take this class if you're an Econ concentrator and absolutely have to. Lectures are extremely disengaging: not a single person pays attention, and by the end of September, not a single person even attends lecture, because they are extremely irrelevant and scattered. The course does not measure how much Econ you'll learn throughout the semester (which is unfortunately not much at all), but rather how good you are at memorizing problem set questions and trying to solve abstract and unfair test questions that do not measure how much you actually studied or how much you know. Overall, a very disengaging course that you should only suffer through if you're concentrating in Economics; otherwise -- I never thought I'd say this -- you're better off learning basic Econ in Ec10.</comment>Take it because it is a necessity, but don't expect to do the bare minimum and learn.</comment>It is not a lot of work, but you will also walk out not feeling like you learned anything new, apart from memorizing multiple choice questions and applying them on the exams.</comment>You really do not learn much from this class since the exams are just based on the psets. I wish the exams were harder and really tested your knowledge of econ rather than how well you simply memorize practice questions.</comment>The material for 1010a is interesting. Prof. Miron is pretty cool if you put effort into getting to know him outside of class. That said, you will have to find a way to keep yourself awake in lectures, and think consciously about how to get more out of the class than just equations that you need for the p-sets (which you will probably forget after the final anyway.</comment>This course is unfortunate, but it could be much worse.  Professor Miron was a very, very bad lecturer, but if you go to section and do the readings, you might actually find the material covered in this course to be relevant to other aspects of your life.  The 4 exam + 1 final format, without mandatory problem sets, was a bit bizarre, but it did help in that you could do very poorly on one exam without destroying your grade.  Also, there was nothing subjective about the grading system.  The assessments aren't very difficult, but the lack of weekly structure made this course demand a lot of individual effort compared to the multitude of assessments with Ec10.  Especially if you like microeconomics better than macro, go ahead and take this for your secondary, but don't expect to become much better versed in microeconomics theory than after Ec 10.  This essentially just added more math, which you don't generally need in daily life.</comment>This course was the worst of my four this semester. The professor makes lecture so boring and disengaging that 60-70% of the class stopped showing up to lecture by the second week. Lecture topics are completely unrelated to the problem sets, which you MUST study for the four midterms. Make sure you get Nancy as your TF, because she is the only one who knows exactly what she is talking about. You need to get Nancy!</comment>I would tell students to prepare for very dry and un - stimulating lectures and a maths - centered economics class.</comment>I have such mixed feelings about this class. I found the content difficult, the professor boring and uninterested, and the lectures convoluted and useless. I loved that problem sets were not graded because it allowed me to spend time on the class when I had time and ignore it when I did not. And for all of its faults, it could not have a better group of tfs. Eli and Nancy are wonderful teaching fellows, extremely dedicated to their students and willing to go above and beyond in order to help everyone achieve success.</comment>It's terribly taught and structured, but it's not hard. Memorize the steps for answering all the pset questions and you're set. Lecture is incredibly boring but unfortunately not taped</comment>There are some courses here at Harvard that are absolutely fascinating and expand your understanding and interpretation of the world. This is not one of those courses.

This is not necessarily the fault of Professor Miron or the teaching staff. Though lectures could sometimes be uninteresting and go at too fast a pace, the teaching staff were nice and helpful. Rather, the problem lies in the material itself: conceptually, you learn the exact same things as in Ec10a and don't really go more in-depth with the concepts. The only thing that's different is that there's more math. Because of this fact, it's almost impossible for this course to actually be interesting. 

This isn't really a painful course in the sense that the material isn't too difficult and the exams, though too numerous (there's four midterms!) are largely fair. If you have to take this for the Ec concentration, don't worry too much; it's not a massive time commitment. If you don't have to take it, though, I probably wouldn't.</comment>Don't let this course dissuade you of doing the Econ track! I know it's dry, I know you will not like the lectures, but the electives after this course should be really interesting!</comment>Lecture is disorganized and hard to follow, but the midterms are fairly straightforward.</comment>do the pests</comment>Try and think about the material and invest, you get out of it what you put in. The course is better for someone with a mathematical tendency</comment>I would tell other students that the course moves really fast, especially at the beginning even during shopping week, so it is important not to fall behind.</comment>This course design is pretty unstructured so students considering to take this course will have to be prepared to do a substantial amount of self-studying for the class.</comment>If your Econ and don't want to do 1011a you have to take it. Miron hates teaching it and nobody puts in any work but the material can be interesting.</comment>This was probably the worst course I have taken. Professor Miron makes it clear from the first lecture that he is less interested in being there than the students. The exams test whether students make stupid errors rather than whether they understand the underlying economic concepts.</comment>This class is horrible. Take it only if you need it for a requirement. Really, don't take it.</comment>Professor Miron and the TFs are very knowledgeable so seek them out of you have questions.</comment>Good course, not too much work, and the majority of learning can be done on your own time</comment>This is not a good representative course of the econ department. If you can do the psets then you will do well on the exams (15 MC). However, the course and the psets do not teach you anything applicable. Only take this class if you need to fulfill concentration requirements. Do not take it for fun!!</comment>I love this class; I heavily disagree with all the negative q-guide comments about this course that I read when trying to decide whether to take this class. The material is interesting and relevant, Miron is a good lecturer, and the course is so painless (there is no busywork). This course was 100x better than Ec 10a</comment>You will have to take it as an ec concentrator, if you are not planning on taking ec1011, so might as well like it and make the most out of it.</comment>Just memorize how to do all the homework problems and you'll be fine. The conceptual stuff doesn't matter.</comment>Professor Miron does not care about you or the course. He makes sloppy mistakes on his presentations and no effort to engage the students. Throughout the semester, explanations on pset answer keys become decreasingly helpful, let alone legible. That being said, the class is not hard if you keep up with the psets, and the grading is fair and straightforward. If you have to take it, it will be okay.</comment>The Professor does not enjoy teaching the class and it shows, lectures are extremely boring and do not even help for the tests since they are problem set based. You have to take this course as an economics concentrator, but it is my least favorite course so far at Harvard.</comment>Really did not like this class. It seemed like all the material was just copied from the publisher of the book. I really enjoy classes that teach us how to think and give us a broader concept of the subject material. For this class I was literally just memorizing equations.</comment>Take it if you have to so long as Miron is teaching it.</comment></comment>You have to take it. Prepare yourself for pointless exams and no feedback given on any work you do. It is not a learning exercise, it is just jumping through hoops. Having said that Miron is actually pretty good.</comment>Boring class. Lectures are useless. Book is useless. Only psets matter for exam material.</comment>Ec10 with math, everything you found interesting in Ec10 will just be repeated with math added so you probably won't find it interesting again.</comment>If you are not required to take this course, do not take it.  You will not enjoy the class or Professor Miron.  I made the mistake of taking it because I thought I had to for my Economics secondary.  I deeply regret taking this course.  I would rather have a lower grade in another Economics course that I enjoy and has a good professor than take this class again.</comment>If you really like economics or have a strong math background, definitely just take Econ 1011a, as that will probably be more rewarding for you. I liked the material, but the course itself is poorly set up. This course is not structured very well in terms of support for students and fostering a strong interest in the field of economics. It is sad to see that all tests are multiple choice, which made students memorize answers or figure out tricks on exams instead of learning the economics concepts. Also, I thought it was very counterproductive for students not to have access to lecture notes, and Prof. Miron's lectures were not very engaging or helpful for the material we were being tested on. Attendance dropped significantly after the first month. Also, having only multiple choice exams count towards our grade with no opportunities for partial credit for people that love economics and understand the concepts, but make some basic math errors was slightly unfair, particularly because many students do not take the time to understand the concepts and instead just memorize answers or guess.</comment>You have no choice</comment>great</comment>This class has interesting material, but is not challenging or very interesting. Professor Miron does not lecture very well, and the problem sets and exams are not challenging, so I ended up not learning as much as I probably could have. If taking this class is a requirement, and you're deciding between this and Econ 1011a, then you just have to evaluate the tradeoff – take an easy but boring class or a hard and stimulating class.</comment>If you are doing EC, it's either this or 1011a. My blockmate was in 1011a and it is a nightmare. Take this class, learn stuff, don't drown yourself in work.</comment>This course is not very exciting, but there are some interesting things to learn.</comment>Do the problem sets on time, otherwise you'll be reviewing everything the night before the exam</comment>You have to be willing to teach yourself with regards to the problem sets.</comment>Lectures are useless for the workbook, which is useless for the multi-choice, which (other than the copied problems) aren't too helpful for the exams</comment>I wouldn't take this unless you need it for a concentration or secondary. Not because it is a bad class, but you can get all the same ideas from Ec 10. This class just applies those ideas to more complicated problems.</comment>This class teaches you very little beyond applying calculus to concepts you learned in ec 10. Unfortunately it is a requirement needed to take more advanced ec courses.</comment>As you can tell from past years, 1010a hasn't been the most well-liked course. I think this semester was an attempt to improve the course, but it definitely didn't work. The 4 midterms and final were all multiple choice, which I thought was sort of strange for Ec. Sections were completely pset solving sessions, which I found helpful, but again I thought that TFs didn't really know what was going on with the course other than that. Lecture wasn't very helpful -- I found myself reading the textbook most of the time, which even then was sometimes confusing. If you're an ec concentrator, you obviously have to take the course, but if you're only interested in taking an ec course at Harvard I probably wouldn't recommend taking this class with the expectation of learning anything particularly insightful.</comment>Its a great class; just focus on learning the Psets. That's the best way to study for the midterms and final; lecture is not useful.</comment>The instructor is a good guy. The material is drudge work.</comment>You can have two fives on the AP exams, do Ec10 and get A's but at the end of the day Ec1010a is what it is. . .a mess. I would NOT recommend this class to anyone I love or respect in any way. This was the most miserable experience. Bless my TF, he tried, but this class is just not salvageable. I mean if you're doing Ec, great, but if not, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!!</comment>It's required for Econ concentrators, and is an alternative to Ec1011 if you cannot do multivariable. Unfortunately, that's about it.</comment>This class is not too bad. Professor Miron doesn't inspire much interest in the subject. However, I do recommend finding a good TF and going to section weekly because that is where you will learn the most. Reading the textbook is not necessary other than for the formulas.</comment>This class is very frustrating because the p-sets are very math based and you aren't taught how to do them.  Go to Eli Satcher's section.  That's the only thing that saved me!  He actually explains everything.  Otherwise, you're going to have to teach yourself how to do the p-sets out of the blue.  The lectures are pretty much the same as what you learned in Ec10, so they don't help with the p-sets which are totally different and on a whole 'nother level.</comment>The class itself was not too difficult as long as you take full advantage of section and use the material provided for practice. The final exam was, however, surprisingly difficult compared to all of the psets and midterms we had. I did not feel sufficiently prepared for the final, but the curve was much more lenient than it was for the midterms so it was fine.</comment>If the format remains multiple choice and the materials remain the same, I would tell them it was the most boring and uninspiring class I've ever taken.  It requires the least amount of work and is fundamentally flawed.</comment>Pros: The Psets mirror the tests exactly, so you know exactly what you have to teach yourself to succeed in this course.
Cons: Everything you learn you have to teach yourself. The lectures and textbook are generally considered to be unhelpful.</comment>This course made me switch my concentration from Ec to Gov. Even though it may seem simple because of its multiple choice exams and lenient lecture policy, it has no "cushion" and creates a very "sink or swim" environment. Although I found the material interesting and fun (especially when I understood it), lack of access to TFs (and lack of access to good TFs), unfair multiple choice exams (which encourage rote memorization over actual understanding of the material), and Professor Miron's own disinterest in the course really turned me off. What was the most frustrating was that everyone, even Miron, acknowledges that the system set up for 1010a simply doesn't work, but nobody really tries to improve it or help students who are struggling to succeed under its bullshit structure. This seems to be a common complaint about the Ec department in general, which is why I decided to get out of there. If you're an Ec concentrator and set on being one, you have no choice but to trudge through this course. Things will get better. However, if you become so frustrated with the course that you want to switch out of the department, know that you're not alone in this sentiment, and that it's completely okay.</comment>Only take if you must.  As bad as you've heard.</comment>The format of this class makes it pretty hard to learn any concepts whatsoever. You have to put in a lot of individual work/study to learn anything or do well</comment>Wouldn't recommend to anyone not an Ec major</comment>Optional problem sets and midterms with questions pulled straight from those problem sets sounds great, until you find yourself tripping over every question on the final. And the worst part is that I have no idea what any of us could have done to be better prepared, because they tested at a far higher level than they ever taught. Beyond that very negative ending point, the rest of the class is relatively straightforward, though definitely not what anyone would call fun or interesting or engaging. It's mainly a matter of trudging through the textbook and problem sets on your own. I took the class without any previous background in economics (possible, but takes a lot of time), and found that the lectures, though dry, did help with my understanding of the material.</comment>Professor Miron changed the format of the course to get the Q score up. All P-sets, lectures, and sections were optional. Basically you could show up only for tests and you could still get an A. Tests were multiple choice with almost half of every test being composed of questions directly copied from the optional p-sets. Miron even thanked us one day for just showing up to lecture. Overall, it was a pretty easy class for a concentration requirement.</comment>Read the textbook. Go to section if you have a good TF. If not, find a good TF. 
Stay on top of your work. 

Miron is a dry lecturer. It's still helpful to hear the concepts over again from him, so sometimes lectures are useful. Sometimes not. 

I took this course without Ec 10a or b. (and my AP Economics class in high school was a joke). Ec1010a is definitely doable if you put the work into it.</comment>Lecture is not great so you really have to rely on yourself to learn the material and your grade based solely on 5 tests so be prepared for that component of the course.</comment>take it only if you have to. Be prepared to not know much, be disengaged, and scramble to try and get as many  multiple choice questions right on every test. Not a great class.</comment>If you took any Econ in high school, I would recommend taking Ec1010a instead of Ec10a. The extra math you use is not very hard (partial derivatives, which they teach in class and are kept pretty simple)and it saves you from repeating all the topics you did in Ec10 so you save a year.
That said, I have a bunch of reservations about this course. This year, and in years past, your whole grade is based on 90 multiple choice questions over the course of the semester. Lecture is not interesting and the professor didn't reinforce the material in a way that made students more engaged, so many people just read the textbook and did the problem sets. Most of my friends in the course really disliked it mostly because our professor seemed very detached and the structure of the course was pretty bad. But if you have to take it, take it. The material is important to learn if you want to concentrate in Econ.</comment>The way this course is structured, your end grade really depends on the curve. With each test having half of the questions consistently drawn from your problem sets, the difference between a letter is only a question. It isn't that great and is one of the major drawbacks of the class for me. You may work really hard, but if you mess up one question on the midterm, your grade is dramatically different because of the curve.</comment>If they don't change the structure, it is an incredibly low workload class. Lectures are absolutely useless...I don't think anyone went to lecture after the first midterm. Literally sit down the night before the exam, do the three (8-10 questions each) problem sets for the exam, and you are set. Half of the exam is exactly copied from the problem sets (literally an exact copy), and the other half is pretty much the same. And I'm not even good at econ. Literally the class is a breeze, especially if you have taken Ec 10a. No one in the class has any respect for the class at all. The difference between this and 1011a is absolutely night and day. You have nothing to gain by stressing yourself out with 1011a. Do what's good for you, take this class, and focus your attention elsewhere.</comment>There is rigidity in the structure of the course. Pay attention specifically to psets and lectures- textbook material seems less important to the grading of the course, and often is full of jargon.</comment>It's really not that bad.  The instruction leaves something to be desired, but it's easy enough to get through thanks to the low workload and in-class exam questions taken directly from the p-sets.  And if you are genuinely interested in economics, you will learn a lot about how math and models can be applied to the discipline.  Granted, it's not everyone, but personally I liked learning about these things.</comment>This course will singlehandedly remove most of your desire to study economics. You'll probably do well enough and get an A range grade, but you'll feel all the excitement you found in Ec10 slip away into nothingness.</comment>Really try to do the psets in advance and definitely take advantage of section</comment>You have to take this class if you're an economics concentrator, but you might be better off taking it in the Spring if the class is better. This was honestly one of the least enjoyable classes I had at Harvard.</comment>If you like econ and you like calculus, then this is a good course. Lectures are kinda boring and long, but there is very little coursework. Tests are pretty easy</comment>Know the problem sets very well and the exams will be doable.</comment>Unless someone wants an easy course to breeze through, I would not recommend this course. It will not give you a solid understanding of the material nor will it challenge you in any way to test your comprehension.</comment>Not fun.</comment>Do the pests, bro!</comment>The reshaped version of this class is not bad at all. The problem sets are optional but useful as they are quite similar to the exams. The exams are multiple choice and quite straightforward. Lectures are boring and not necessary for success in the class. Section is optional and I did not find it particularly useful.</comment>Take this course if you have to for economics concentration requirements.</comment>It's required, just do it.  Nothing is really necessary except the problem sets, which are highly correlated to the exams.  Not sure why people are saying the Psets are not the exams, they are literally the same questions a lot of the time.  All multiple choice, too.</comment>This class is a concentration requirement, so you'll have to take it.  I think it needs to undergo deep restructuring.  I do not think most kids in the class learned much, as shown with the final exam.  Due to the structure of the teaching, people simply memorize how to do the problem sets rather than learning what it actually means.  So, when the final exam had questions we were unfamiliar with, most people were unable to actually apply their knowledge to solve the problems.  Most students gave up on going to lecture by the end of the term because of its uselessness in teaching us.  One classmate actually found the lecture powerpoints on an external website.  There are no lecture notes posted online, and there are little resources for students to learn.  Since the psets are never due, students can't get any feedback on their work.  Also, since the exams (four midterms and one final) are all multiple choice, students who actually know how the material may end up getting the same grade as people who don't because there are so few questions that making small errors can leave you with the same grade as someone who randomly guesses on the exams.</comment>This is probably my least favorite class that I've taken at Harvard. I found it extremely unfulfilling and unenjoyable. It gave me a better understanding for how math is incorporated into economics and makes it more applied, but beyond that, I didn't find many positive aspects to this class (it was also pretty easy, so that was another positive). It seems like Professor Miron doesn't really want to teach it, which definitely makes lecture unenjoyable. Sections are alright in terms of preparing you for the exams, but could do a lot more to make the class actually worthwhile. Overall, I found myself unhappy and annoyed with this course.</comment>Much better than Ec 1011a, and more applicable. Learn more in my opinion.</comment>Unless you are taking this class for a concentration requirement, I really would not take this class.</comment>This class is necessary to take, but don't expect to learn much. It is very much problem based and not related to the economy as a whole. Lecture can be very boring. The material is dry, and this class made me really not like economics anymore.</comment>It's painful, but it's necessary. Don't go to lecture; it's a waste of your time because you learn everything from the optional p-sets.</comment>NA</comment>The only reason it exists in the current format has to be that Miron is great at damage control and convincing people that the only reason Q scores are so low is because of the subject matter and not him or the format of the class. With that being said, as an economics concentrator, its either this or 1011.</comment>Miron is an okay lecturer.. He is helpful, in that he spends a lot of time going over formulas step-by-step. Still, I think Ec 10 did a better job showing real-world examples, and getting us to grapple with the theories and develop intuition. This is why lecture was boring, besides the fact that it's an hour and a half long when it could easily be 1 hour.</comment>This is a fine class if more advanced economics is what you are looking for.  The class grade is made up of 100% exams so take that as you will.  The lectures can at times be really interesting--however neither they nor the textbook will really prepare you the exams.  Except for the final though, the exams were easy and mostly consisted of logic questions and not so much complicated economics.  Your math ability does not need to be high to do just fine in 1010a.</comment>I did well, but didn't really feel like I learned much. I skipped Ec 10, and had absolutely no trouble in the class. You basically just had to know how to do the practice problems, which were gone over in detail in section. There was no point in going to lecture.</comment>If you took AP Economics, not only will you already know everything this class teaches you, the problem sets and exams are still not doable because they are entirely multiple choice that test odd permutations of simple concepts. This class is the textbook taught three times- once read aloud (not kidding) during lecture, once assigned as reading, and once on the problem sets/exams. Also, the exams are consistently 40% the exact same problems from the psets so there's that. Generally lazy course all around.</comment>The lectures don't correspond to the tests at all.</comment>This class is not interesting and the material can be very heavy, especially the way that it is presented in lecture.  However, since it is a requirement more an economics concentrator, there is no way around it. The one positive thing that I can say about it is that sections were very helpful and I learned a great deal more in section than I did in lecture, so make sure you go to section.</comment>Do the psets. Get help on them. Know the concepts associated with them inside out.</comment>It actually blows my mind that some courses at Harvard can be so terrible. This is not a good class in any aspect, but it may be one you HAVE to take. Here is some useful advice if the course is anything like it was this year: don't buy the book, don't buy the workbook, don't go to lecture. The books are a waste of money and lecture a waste of time. If you have lecture go to the library and look up old lecture notes or google whatever the topic is for an hour and a half, you will be far ahead of any of your classmates. The topics could be interesting, but man does this course need some work.</comment>This course is much more difficult than past semesters. This is because there are now 4 exams consisting of 15-16 multiple choice questions. There is no partial credit to provide better acuity of mastery. The grading scales have generally been 15-16 for an A, so you pretty much have to be perfect to do well on exams. The final exam is much more difficult than all the exams because the 4 midterms do not provide an adequate measure of difficulty for the final exam. 

Go to section and find Nancy as your section leader because Professor Miron most likely still does not care for this course. Without her, it is hard to tell how well you can do in this class.</comment>A very good, straightforward course that allows you to gain some intuition about some interesting toy problems in economics. Don't have to attend lecture, but if you choose not to definitely read the book carefully and do all the problem sets. No tricks in this course, which is good.</comment>This class is poorly run, but economics is interesting if you like economics. I probably wouldn't take it as an elective, but it's not as bad as everyone makes it out to be. They just grade kind of weirdly which is pretty annoying.</comment>This is probably one of the worst classes I have taken at Harvard. I feel like I got a lot more out of ec10 in terms of economics knowledge.</comment>you have to take it, but they make it suck</comment>Stay on top of coursework.</comment>DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE unless you absolutely have to for a concentration requirement. I hardly learned anything in this course and requires hardly any time throughout the semester. You may feel like you are very prepared for test but getting 2-3 multiple choice questions wrong can already be equivalent to a B/B+ because the exams are so easy, and you do not learn a lot which is really frustrating. Lectures are useless. This is the first class at Harvard that I have skipped lecture for. The only exam preparation given is the multiple choice psets. There is hardly any useful supplements to help you learn.</comment>Attend section and learn how to do problems. You can attend lecture, too.</comment>If you want to study or do well on tests, you only have the problem sets to work with. Class and textbook are useless. Had a pretty bad experience with TF's. If you're a bad test taker, you might really struggle with this course. Do not recommend unless you really need to take it for Econ concentration.</comment>This course was pretty painless and not nearly as boring as everyone makes it out to be. It certainly wasn't my favorite course, but manageable and helpful if you are continuing with Econ.</comment>Absolutely hated it. Microeconomics dont make any sense, Miron is just a very boring teacher.</comment>I recommend taking this course if you have taken AP and gotten a 4 or 5. It is impossible to succeed or pass from just lecture, but if you go to section and try hard you should get an A or A-.</comment>The material is quite interesting. However, the class is incredibly poorly run, section is awful, and lecture is quite boring. The textbook will be your best friend.</comment>Class was really easy, but also really boring. Lectures are not mandatory or helpful for understanding the material. Section is also not mandatory but can be helpful if you don't understand the material.</comment>Very poorly run</comment>It's a class you need to take for economics, but you will end up going to 2 lectures and learning everything you can from the book</comment>Psets help with everything a ton, and the lectures help answer questions. The new test format really helped out and decreased time requirement.</comment>Miron is a poor lecturer who does not want to teach the class. He generates almost no enthusiasm for the already dry material. You will learn about microeconomics, but it is likely you will teach yourself what you end up learning.</comment>Don't take this class unless you need to. As of fall '14 with Miron, the testing in this class is awful thanks to a multiple-choice only format.</comment>go to section, go to office hours to better understand how problems are done</comment>Unless you are required to take this, I would recommend that you don't take it. It is poorly structured  and unhelpful in learning microeconomics.</comment>Easy. because of the pset policy. Really, really boring though.</comment>It's exactly as described: an intermediate microeconomics course. Very useful for understanding microeconomics. It's not terribly time-intensive, though the multiple-choice-ness of the course leaves no room for error, since there is no partial credit.</comment>The problem sets are not graded which means that you need to be prepared to keep yourself on track. The final exam was very difficult so don't take anything for granted!</comment>There is a lot of self teaching in this class. The way the class was set up with multiple choice psets and exams made it difficult for students to really learn the concepts because a MC problem set based class tends to have students understand how to solve certain questions but unable to think more critically beyond that</comment>Only take the class if you're an Economics concentrator. The lectures are terrible, but the workload isn't too bad, so while it shouldn't deter you from being an Econ concentrator, it has no added value to your life.</comment>Take this class if you don't want to go through the rigors that is 1011a. Don't take this class for fun, it is not. Take it if you want to concentrate in economics, but please don't base your concentration on this class solely.</comment></course>EXPOS 20.267: Society and the Witch</title>This class is definitely a pretty good class to choose for Expos 20.</comment>It's a great way to further develop the skills from high school</comment>Writing is by far not my favorite thing to do. I am a much more math and science oriented person. The class was a challenge and not always enjoyable for me. That being said, I did enjoy lots of the readings and movies for the class (harry potter, etc.). Talking with other people about their expos, I felt other expos classes were less demanding and provided more overall guidance.</comment>It will teach you the elements of a true scholarly paper that contributes to knowledge on a certain subject. The subject that this course studies may seem boring at certain times, but very engaging at other times.</comment>This class was demanding in the amount of time required for assignments, but its definitely one of the better expos classes. This class provides helpful structure and guidance but also gives you the independence to write on a topic that interests you.</comment>Most people hate Expos, but the topic was interesting and made the mandatory requirement a lot more bearable. The preceptor is enthusiastic about the topic and helping his students. If you are a Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, or Wicked fan I highly recommend this class.</comment>The readings cover a range of field - from cinematic to anthropological - so you will likely find at least some that interest you and other that are incredibly boring. That said, in terms of actually teaching writing, this class didn't feel productive at all. There are probably better expos classes. Take it at your our risk.</comment>Really interesting, take it if you like harry potter or witches! It is hard but i think all expos classes are, this one doesn't have too much reading!</comment>Everyone else in my class seems to have loved it. I thought it was fine, but not quite what I expected.</comment>Expos 20.267: Society and the Witch, while still being as miserable as the other Expos courses, was probably more interesting in terms of its subject material. Students who did not do much writing in high school, such as myself, will have a very difficult time, and those with a lot of writing experience will still find it unenjoyable. However, if the student takes initiative and puts a lot of individual work in, they may improve as a writer through Expos.</comment>Some of the anthropologists' reports on magic were boring, but working with your choice of magical primary sources (like Harry Potter) is really cool.</comment></course>ENGLISH Cffr: Adapting Short Fiction to Film: Workshop</title>This course is a great way to become more familiar with yourself as a writer. It is also a great way to learn how to give and take writing criticisms.</comment>This class really expands on the generic creative courses that are generally offered here. If you are interested in working with source material and spearheading its adaptation process, this class is quite rewarding. Bear in mind that this is not necessarily an introductory screenwriting course. It would definitely help to have some background in the medium, but you could probably get by without it.</comment>It's cool. Apply.</comment>Mark is a great great guy who is very honest and at the same time very constructive. Don't be afraid to ask him all of the questions--he's always ready to help. He also values collaboration in the classroom a lot, and really appreciates when students have ideas for each others' works, so just don't be afraid to speak out at all. Creative writing classes are generally awesome classroom environments, but this one really felt like a safe space for all of us to learn from each other. Seriously of all of the ones I've taken (three) this one was by far the most enjoyable.</comment>Great learning experience</comment></course>SWEDISH Aa: Beginning Swedish Language and Literature</title>It's really fun and interesting!</comment>You can not find a better language class at Harvard. I know a lot of language learners and no one loves their class or their teacher as much as I do. I know Maja is leaving, but I still feel so strongly that Swedish is an incredible language and an incredible culture.</comment></course>HIST-LIT 90ak: The Vietnam War in American Culture</title>I would definitely recommend this class especially if you are considering Hist/Lit. Steve is a good person to know and is so open to talking about not only his class but your future plans. He genuinely wants to get to know his students so try to get to know him! The vast majority of materials are interesting and the class discussions are interesting. It's definitely one of those classes where you realize just how much you've learned when you go back to review for the final and see all the connections between the vast amount of materials you've read. Don't skimp on the assignments! It hurts you and the rest of the class since you won't be able to participate.</comment>Definitely reading/movie heavy but it's a great class and Steve is great at facilitating discussion.</comment>Hands down the best course I have taken at Harvard. The readings and films are all considered "the best" of the Vietnam War, and finished the course proud of all I read and watched. It is a lot of work, for sure, but very rewarding, and truthfully not so bad to spend a few hours a week watching an Academy Award Winning movie. Section was great, and the two hours usually flew by with great discussion.</comment>Take this class. It will be one of the best classes you'll take at Harvard. No matter what your concentration, I think it is such a critically important subject matter that often gets kind of glossed over. Taking the time to explore the many ways in which the Vietnam War has affected this country, the world, etc. and the incredible ways in which the experience has been portrayed and expressed through film and text and autobiography... You don't want to miss out. Steve is also just awesome. Discussions are really fascinating - there's never a dull moment - while at the same time really easy-going. He gave me great feedback on my writing, and I loved getting a taste of the Hist & Lit department. Amazing - take it!</comment>If you are lucky enough to get into this course (or if Steve chooses to offer it again), I'd recommend you take it. A wonderful entry into the study of the Vietnam War. The syllabus is filled with phenomenal novels, provoking documentaries, and fun movies. I left the course with a tremendous amount of knowledge on the subject. On top of all of that, Steve's fabulous.</comment>There will be a LOT of reading, but the knowledge gained is very much worth the effort.</comment>This was best course I have taken at Harvard. In it, you will address not only key details of how the war unfolded, but also important cultural questions. Integrating documentaries, memoirs, fictional novels, and films, this class will allow you to understand the war not only as an international conflict but also as an American cultural phenomenon. Take this class!</comment>This is BY FAR the best discussion class I have taken at Harvard. I constantly felt like the dumbest person in the class, in the best way possible. I learned SO much from my peers, and our discussions were open and supportive, allowing me to feel comfortable sharing my own thoughts. It was truly an amazing experience and convinced me that History and Literature was the concentration for me.</comment>This is the epitome of a "Harvard" course. We discussed the material in an incredibly thoughtful way, challenged each other in our preconceived notions, and dealt with the subject in a respectful way as Steve always made us acutely aware of the harsh truths that were behind every piece of literature we discussed. This is an excellent course for anyone interested in literary analysis (since it is much more of a literature course than a history course), and especially interesting for people who are interested in film or other mediums.</comment>This is how classes should be. They should teach you and encourage discussion. This class makes the GenEd system look like a joke because it demonstrates how you can take something that's but necessarily in your concentration and make it interesting, challenging, and worthwhile.</comment>This class is amazing.  Steve is one of the best professors you could ever have--an amazing teacher and person.  You can tell he really cares about each of his students, and wants them to grow as learners.  Beyond that, he is really invested in what students think about not just the class material but also life--specifically life at Harvard--which is extremely refreshing.  The material in this class is amazing, and I looked forward to going to class every week.</comment></course>HEB 1463: Molecular Evolution of the Primates</title>It will help you improve your ability to read scientific articles.</comment>When I took the course there were only two other students with me. Prof. Ruvolo is an excellent instructor, keen on making sure her students are prepared for assignments and are learning the materials. She is extremely supportive and understanding, yet willing to give tough love when necessary. She cares about her student's growth.</comment></course>PHYSICS 143b: Quantum Mechanics II</title>The class was all over the place, and so was lecture.</comment>You will learn useful topics of quantum mechanics, and it is quite helpful for research ( reading publications, journal papers)</comment>A great class that develops the applications of 143a. My favorite topic was time-dependent perturbation theory; it's interesting to think about how quantum systems evolve in time. Path integrals, identical particles, and WKB were also really interesting. My least favorite topic was scattering. The introduction to relativistic quantum mechanics at the end is very brief and I'm not sure if I actually learned anything, but it's cool to see the very beginnings of QFT.</comment>This course is a natural extension of 143a and should be taken by any physics concentrator unless you have good reason not to. If you felt 143a was more math and not enough physics, then this class will give you the physics.</comment>We looked at some really fascinating problems. Some of the math on problem sets was tedious, but overall they were interesting. Exam problems were hit-or-miss, in terms of how they related to the material from lecture.</comment>You get to see a lot of "real-world" applications of the quantum formalism you develop in 143a and a few nice approximation tools along the way, which helps to build your general intuition (and appreciation!) for QM. However, while Professor Hailu is extremely energetic (he is a hep-th after all…) and highly entertaining during lecture, he is 99.99% incomprehensible (trust me, I've measured), so yeah, just read the books…he's a great guy to talk to during office hours though! He's still mostly incomprehensible, but he puts the physics first and the math second, which more than compensates.</comment>The material covered is fantastic, and can make sense in office hours.  Lectures can be difficult to understand occasionally.</comment>You will need a lot of time and be willing to deal with frustration.</comment>This class is pretty good. Some of the topics can be pretty interesting, giving you insight into how things like semiconductors and Bose-Einstein condensation work. Other topics mainly include different approximation techniques, and so aren't as interesting. But all these topics, although involving some complex math, are presented in lecture in a very straightforward way that's easy to process. Because of this, as long as you attend and take notes in lecture, the problem sets and exams are usually pretty manageable. But lecture notes can be really important, because the course doesn't really follow a particular book or anything. Overall, this course is worthwhile; it isn't too much work, and it introduces you to some interesting advanced quantum mechanics topics that will be useful to know for any further advanced physics study.</comment>This class is the first class in the "standard" track that in many ways is not necessary, but rather a series of interesting topics in QM. That said, some of the topics are amazing. Take this class if you have interest in going to graduate school, but if you felt shaky in 143a, then I might recommend putting this class off. In general, don't take classes with Girma, as he has an amazing amount of passion for physics but is confounding in his presentation of topics.</comment>This class is much much much better than 143a. You finally get to learn some pretty neat applications for the stuff you've been learning. It's still tough, but the teaching staff was really helpful and always willing to help out, even outside of office hours.</comment>Take this class! Quantum mechanics is always amazing and Dr. Hailu is a great instructor who is very enthusiastic both about teaching in general and the content of the course in particular.</comment>This course had a lot of interesting topics, and I think it's important for a physicist to have seen most of those topics. It covers a lot of useful approximation methods.
You should make sure to read Griffiths' QM book even if it's not assigned, it's quite good and very useful.
If Prof. Hailu is teaching the course, definitely go to his office hours. They are excellent and though I struggled to follow his lectures he was incredibly clear in office hours and when I went I felt I developed a good intuition for what was going on.</comment></course>HISTSCI 272: Big Data: Past, Present, Future</title>Rebecca brings a particular and incredibly useful approach to the history of Big Data--from the perspective of the history of the human sciences. She's super engaged with contemporary discussions from popular media and scholarship and weaves this together to drive the class to make critical and historically minded judgements about the possibilities and pitfalls of the big data hype.</comment>If you work in data science or have an interest in the philosophy of informatics, this course will provide useful background and insights to guide professional development.</comment>Big Data covers some really interesting dimensions to the subject that I hadn't considered before!</comment>For a buzzword that has been on everyone's lips for the last couple of years, this course does a great job of drawing out the continuities between Big Data and preceding technologies, allowing students to explore the more exciting discontinuities. I did not think I would find the weeks dealing with library management and various formats as exciting as, under the guidance of Professor Lemov, the discussions turned out to be.</comment></course>APPHY 282: Solids: Structure and Defects</title>This class is really wonderful. Frans does an incredible job lecturing and covering a huge amount of material. You will leave having learned a ton about structure/defects but you will also have gained good tools that I think are transferable to almost any research. Just all around good critical thinking skills.</comment>Although the workload was a bit large, it was the most time-effective course I've taken. So I highly recommend it to anyone who had some previously knowledge of material science and want to learn more :)</comment>Be prepared to spend a lot of time outside the class in order to fully absorb the incredible amount of material covered in this class. A lot of material is covered in a lot of detail in the undergraduate guide, so definitely use that (especially before doing homework problems). Use the reading lists, especially the books that Frans recommends! I didn't realize until later what a great resource it was. The oral final sounds scary but it can also be a lot of fun -- I think a lot of things really came together not only as I was preparing for my final and also during my final.</comment></course>HISTSCI 108: Bodies, Sexualities, and Medicine in the Medieval Middle East</title>Pretty intense if you're looking for an easy gen ed. Super interesting and wonky if you want something totally different than anything you're studying. Casual "penetration"s in lecture.</comment>I absolutely loved this course, it is a great class and has a lot to offer many different people. The class had many different avenues and was to cater to people with all sorts of comfortability with the material.</comment>It is very interesting and eye-opening, with intriguing lectures. The class itself does not require much work, but the section was intense for me!</comment>This class is extremely interesting and does not require a lot of work -- you'll learn about something that is difficult to learn about outside of this course</comment>it is interesting and not too much work.</comment>unique course with interesting material</comment>Good class but some of the material can be challenging due to its foreign nature.</comment>You get out of this course what you put into it. Be committed and let this course teach you more than you could have expected.</comment>Be aware that participation is extremely important in this class. If you go into section without doing the readings, things get very uncomfortable quickly.</comment>Dr Ragab is awesome - both in terms of his theoretical knowledge and his pedagogical commitments - and you must take at least one class with him</comment>That it's harder if you don't know anything about the topic going into it.</comment>This class was extremely interesting but I found the lectures were extremely disconnected and disorganized.</comment>The material is hard to understand if you have no back ground</comment>overall was an enjoyable class, but section was my least favorite part</comment>If you are familiar with the faith, you will sometimes be bored by the historical contextualization of some of the subject matter. However, the readings presented in the course and the discussion of queerness and sexual practice in pre-modern islamicate life is absolutely unique to Prof. Ragab's course and has been one of the most eye-opening discussions about Islam I have had.</comment>The class is very informative and the course materials are very interesting. The drawbacks are the amount of work (a very ambitious midterm) and you have to take the material with a grain of salt because not all parts of Muslim society are examined.</comment>For what I got out of it, this class requires too much time.</comment>Its a little bit hard, but its an interesting class to take.</comment>This was a really cool class and in the end not as intimidating as it seemed In the beginning.</comment></course>FRENCH 180: "The Words to Say It": Women Writing in French from Colette to Satrapi</title>Lectures were lengthy, mostly because of lack in class participation and the difficulty of the readings. These are practical issues. In the ideal setting, the material in this course is great, gives you unique perspective on both french and francophone culture, women and gender. Professor Jardine is hugely knowledgeable of the subject from experience.</comment>Alice Jardine is absolutely incredible. Her wealth of personal stories enrich lively discussion around very important texts that everyone should read. Take this class!</comment>Alice Jardine is a fantastic professor who will change the way you think and talk about literature.</comment>This is a great survey of (as the title suggests) women writing in French. But beyond that, it's an amazing opportunity to explore what that really means through a transhistorical and trans-geographic lens.</comment>This class rocks-- it is definitely worth the work.</comment>the semester long project was really enjoyable and section was wonderful</comment>Alice is so cool and has great stories to tell. This is a fantastic class and there is no better way to delve into the stories of francophone women.</comment>I loved this course. It may seem a little off the beaten path, but everything you read is wonderful, and you will learn a ton. Professor Jardine is incredible, and getting the chance to learn from her in such a small, intimate setting was amazing. I would definitely recommend it!</comment>Professor Jardine is incredible, as is this class. It is a lot of reading, so be prepared for that, but it teaches you to think and view things in a very different way. I took this class as an elective</comment>Learned about the diverse movements within the history of feminism in the francophone world, francophone concentrators must take this!</comment>This is an incredible gift of a course. I learned so much not only about the topic, but how to think about the world differently. Professor Jardine is the most incredible professor I have ever had- this course is worth taking just to listen to her incredible stories about brushing elbows with pretty much all of the major French philosophical thinkers of the latter half of the 20th century. The books were all wonderful. This course had little to nothing to do with my course of study here, but I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that it is one of the few I will carry with me for the rest of my life.</comment></course>GOV 94im: Comparative Electoral Systems</title>Electoral systems are such an important part of the political process that are too-often overlooked by political scientists. Professor Smith does a great job engaging the class and giving a surprisingly broad overview of the subject matter.</comment>Great class, and Professor Smith is extremely knowledgable, helpful, and kind. I will say that it's important that you are actually passionate about electoral systems, as the class became kind of repetitive and boring for me after a while.</comment>Excellent combination of theory and case studies</comment>This has been one of my favorite classes at Harvard! Professor Smith does a great job of ensuring that you learn the material and stay engaged during seminar. The grading isn't a piece of cake but isn't harsh either- participation is a major chunk of your final grade. If you're interested in comparative electoral systems at all, take this seminar!! I looked forward to it every week.</comment>Prof. Smith is very chill. Class is very student driven, but the information is very applicable gov concentrators and is very interesting.</comment>This course requires a significant interest in the details of electoral systems. It gets exceptionally repetitive. I would not recommend it unless you are interested in applying the same themes over and over again to different countries. That being said, you are unlikely to get an understanding of these themes unless you take the class. Best option would be to audit the course.</comment>Really awesome class. Interesting material [but not too much work to make it unenjoyable] and Professor Smith is great!!</comment>Professor Smith is very knowledgeable in the subject and makes sure we learn a lot. This is probably the best Gov seminar among all, definitely recommend!</comment>Take this course if you are genuinely passionate about electoral systems.  The course does not allow students to deviate far away from the strict rules and workings of electoral systems, which can be frustrating.</comment>If you are interested in learning about different systems and different countries, definitely take this course! Professor Smith is awesome. He is really helpful whenever you are confused and he is incredibly knowledgable about elections.</comment>Great class, very worth taking.  Highly recommend.  It was fairly relaxed and I looked forward to it every week.</comment></course>GENETIC 201: Principles of Genetics</title>This is a fantastic introduction to genetics. It covers a lot of history and unifying principles that you will never pick up by just reading current papers in the field. It also includes a survey of a number of model organisms which will help you appreciate the pros and cons and unique facets of each. I thought I already knew a fair bit of genetics, but there was a lot of new material here and it was beautifully presented as chalk talks.</comment>The course is more made for computer scientists, and so if you come from a molecular background then you may find answering questions on the problem sets and exams the way the instructors are looking for difficult.</comment>It requires more work than a few other courses, but is very enjoyable</comment>Useful if you're fairly new to genetics but have some background.</comment>The class is challenging, but definitely worthwhile.</comment>Genetics 201 is a well oiled machine. The lecturers are mostly great, the assignments are useful, and the sections are helpful.</comment>I learned so much in this course and the professors are amazing at teaching.</comment>It is worth taking, though at some points it can be painful.</comment>This class was well organized and I think the most important aspects of genetics are included in this. It gives the student a great toolbox that will definitely be helpful in subsequent stages of the graduate career.</comment>It's really hard but you do learn a lot.</comment>Great chalk talk lectures covering genetics in different model organisms. Professors and TAs put a lot of efforts into the class.</comment>Good way to get to know your classmates and suffer together. Useful, but hard.</comment>Definitely stay on top of the material as the course progresses because everything builds off the foundation established in the yeast lecture series. Start problem set questions early if they involve multiple model systems (ex: after finishing fly lecture do that problem on the problem set before waiting until after the next model organisms are covered). Also I would recommend students to always go to discussion and to go to Fred's office hours! Super helpful even if you have no specific question but want to have key concepts re-explained.</comment>Take it seriously, go to lecture. You'll finally get to hear from "their" perspective why people study all those funny little model organisms.</comment>You will learn a lot, but it will be frustrating at times.</comment>great course, well structured</comment>It's a hard class, but I learned sooo much about genetics, some of which I am currently using in my rotation lab.</comment>Very useful to survey many model systems for genetics and learn about experimental methods</comment>A difficult, time-consuming course, but you'll learn a great deal and it's very worth taking.</comment>Challenging but very interesting. I learned many things I would not have learned from any other class and it influenced how I think about biology.</comment>The lectures are great, the problem sets and exams are very challenging but fair. Discussion section is helpful.</comment>Organized and well-taught class that helps you gain an understanding of genetics.</comment>This is a great graduate-level introduction to a wide range of genetics in model organisms (yeast, bacteria, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, zebrafish, mice) and humans. The lecturers are on the whole very good and engaging, and are accessible for queries on course material and beyond. The course is extremely well-organised. Sections are professionally managed and run, and are useful in clarifying concepts and in practising genetics problems. The lecturers, TF and TAs are excellent resources.

I would highly recommend this class if you do not have an extensive background in genetics - the range of material covered means that most people will learn something new. I appreciate the fact that the course focuses on fundamental concepts in genetics, and does not dwell on book-work. The material is useful if you are intending to rotate in a lab focusing on any of the model organisms, and is very useful indeed for understanding core tenets of genetics and in developing an appreciation of the genetics mindset (crosses, mutants and beyond) towards approaching research questions.</comment>If you need it then yes. I dont think i needed it.</comment>it's a well-organized, well-thought-out class.</comment>This course teaches both basic genetic principles as well as strategies for using genetics to address scientific questions. Both are important skills for a beginning graduate student.</comment>It's very hard, but you will learn a lot.</comment>It's a fairly difficult course if you don't have much background in the field, but you'll leave with a decent understanding of genetic technique.</comment></course>FRSEMR 31j: Skepticism and Knowledge</title>I think that this class is very good at introducing skepticism, and what it means to think critically. However, I did not like this class personally because I feel like the conversation and discussions about thinking is too petty. I felt like a lot of the things we discussed were the minute details about the phrasing of everything.</comment>This is not a good class unless one is very interested in philosophy and is planning to pursue it. For anyone else, the class is quite dry and not particularly interactive.</comment>You need to have a STRONG interest in Skepticism; if you do - there's no better environment to learn about it.</comment>Its a good class but can get confusing.</comment></course>ETH-REASON 31: The Philosopher and the Tyrant</title>Take this class!</comment>I loved doing the reading for this class even though I found it difficult, and I encourage people to take classes where the reading list excites you, challenges you, or intrigues you, because that's what I did here, and I don't regret it!</comment>great syllabus. Lectures should be tied in more to readings, exams, etc. because they were totally separate</comment>This is a pretty good class. Philosophy is pretty dry, but you can make some application to the real world, which is cool. You read some good reads also. Overall a dry but relatively easy course.</comment>This is a good class, just keep up with the reading and it should be an enjoyable/smooth class.</comment>Good readings, but easy to get behind.</comment>This class will shake the bottom out of your life like the Lisbon earthquake. You will read The Republic and then meet your wife as a consequence. This is how I met my wife. All of our wedding guests will receive a copy of The Republic. Professor Damrosch, of course, is invited.</comment>This is a great introduction to some of the most important literature in the Western canon taught in a genuinely enjoyable format. I really enjoyed the weekly lectures from Professor Damrosch, who managed to make them entertaining, informative, and poignant to the present day. This class is a great gen-ed because it is very little work on a weekly basis, maybe 100-150 pages of reading a week, and it is also entertaining. I would highly recommend it to anyone who has any interest in learning more about some of the most important philosophers from history, and even if you don't, the information that you learn in this class can keep you afloat in almost any conversation you might have about western literature or wisdom. It's really important material.</comment>The reading list alone is a reason to take this class, but add in a great professor who gives interesting applications of the material to leadership and life, and you have a true gem of a gen ed.</comment>Take the class! The readings are fantastic (and even if you don't do it, the class lectures and prepping for midterm/final will leave you wanting to know more). Keep up with the class responses (not a big deal) and simply pay attention in class. Great alternative to other Eth. Reas. I know of.</comment>ER 31 is the best course I've taken at Harvard. It is a literally life changing course! I enjoyed every minute of it. The readings are really well chosen and how they come together and connect at the end of the semester is beautiful. Professor Damrosch crafted the perfect Gen Ed. To benefit from this course you must do the readings though.</comment>Excellent ER course. Gives you a taste of a lot of different philosophers across history (from ancient Egypt to modern-day), and the course staff is incredible. Relatively light workload.</comment>Ethical Reasoning 31 has an amazing reading list and a very manageable workload.  Professor Damrosch is a great instructor, and the course's blend of philosophy and comparative literature is quite interesting.  I recommend this course as a great way to fulfill the ethical reasoning requirement for anyone with an interest in the intersection between philosophy, politics, and literature.</comment>If there is one class you should take at Harvard, it would be Ethical Reasoning 31 with Professor David Damrosch. You will have no regrets!</comment>A good class if you're interested in the content, the readings and discussion are very interesting.</comment>has a good little work to learn a lot ratio</comment>Professor Damrosch is delightfully quirky. He inflames with passion on seemingly random points at various times during the lecture, which excites attention and generates interest. However, this is exceedingly necessary owing to the two hour lectures that have great potential to drag. Overall, the course material is interesting and the workload isn't bad.</comment>This is absolutely one of the best classes I have ever taken. I could write an essay about why it's so great. Just in case you don't want to read this essay, I'll start with the most important part, that this class forced me to reason abstractly and exercise my logic like I never have before, and also taught me that the most important thing you can ever learn is learning how to learn, not just learning facts - which is the point of a liberal education, since this is what prepares us for operating rationally and justly in an irrational, unjust world, without growing cynical or disillusioned. Damrosch's 2-hour-long lectures are both lively and comprehensive. He puts the readings into historical context, which is so helpful for understanding the importance of the texts, and what influences were shaping them. He then led us into lively discussions in order to get at the meaning of these texts. He offered his own insight without imposing opinions, even as we waded into matters fraught with controversy, like the Bible. Never have I felt so invited to ignore personal opinions and discuss with my classmates purely based on analysis of the author's logic. And whenever people veered off into into irrelevant matters, such as trying to disprove an author's theory based on whether he or she followed it themselves (which digressed from examining the theory itself), Damrosch directly put the discussion back on track. Great readings from a huge swath of time and cultures throughout Near-Eastern and Western civilization.</comment>Don't be intimidated by the amount of reading on the syllabus, it's really manageable. Sections + lectures are great. Overall an awesome ER class.</comment>The texts are phenomenal so just enjoy being bathed in wisdom. Except the first week was not AS interesting as the rest.</comment>Lots of reading! Not an easy gen ed.</comment></course>FRSEMR 41x: Can Government be "good"? Ethics, Public Policy, and Tough Choices</title>Libby is a great professor and the course is awesome! This is your quintessential discussion-based course, with the students leading the conversation and Libby fostering further discussion. Be prepared to do the readings because you will cite them in your response papers. You get a lot out of the class if you join in the discussions, so have an opinion and put it in the conversation.</comment>It is a really interesting class, primarily because of the topics discussed, and it will be so interesting to listen to fellow classmates' views that will be so different from yours.</comment>The course is a really great discussion-based setting that allows students to learn about the variety of ways in which government and ethics collide. It's great for both students who want to concentrate in government and those students who just seem interested in the topic for fun. The workload is definitely manageable and your course experience really depends on how involved your classmates are.</comment>This class is a really interesting look into ethical dilemmas in governing. It was great to discuss these dilemmas with other people interested in their impacts and finding solutions.</comment>Mostly moral choices class. Not much discussion of government.</comment>Interesting topics, but very boring readings. Libby is a great teacher who facilitates discussion extremely well. I'm happy I took this seminar.</comment>This course, at little personal cost (read: not that much work), really changes how you frame and conceive of major political and ethical issues.</comment>This class is very much geared toward people who have a preexisting interest in and knowledge about political ethical issues. Personally, I took the class because I wanted to learn about political issues, not because I already knew about them. As a result, I found it hard to engage with the in-class discussions since all the other students seemed to be political junkies. That being said, the professor, Libby, was great and a very excellent teacher.</comment>This is a great class for those who would like to think about public policy from various perspectives. We cover homelessness, immigration, torture, income distribution, health care, and more. It is very insightful, since we look at each topic through the different lenses of ethics.</comment>it is very focused on ethics</comment></course>ANTHRO 1600: Grounding the Global: Anthropological Approaches</title>This class was a little disorganized, but is a good intro into Anthropology. Some topics were specific to thing like Greece or Thailand, not necessarily towards what I am interested in, but still interesting.</comment>This was a really great anthro class. They totally revamped it from the entry course it used to be. Prof Herzfeld is a really engaging professor and really wants students to take advantage of his office hours. Classes are usually stories instead of lectures. If you're interested even a little bit in contemporary social issues (transnationalism, international politics, housing, financial crisis) you should definitely take this. Also, Bronwyn is a phenomenal TF, definitely get her if you can.</comment>The course is interesting but you need to keep up with the readings and the lectures otherwise it's easy to be lost.</comment>ANTHRO 1600 with Professor Herzfeld is great. You'll learn a lot about anthropology without realizing it, as the course is set up to introduce you to anthropology via primary literature rather than a textbook. This might sound daunting, but it really is a great and painless way to learn about anthropology. Try to get in Bronwyn's section if she's still TFing.</comment>It's a very interesting survey course of social anthropology and covers topics like economics, politics, food, and housing/heritage. Unfortunately it is a bit disorganized so lectures can seem like a disjoined number of examples somewhat related to the general topic without deeper analysis.</comment>The class is successful in introducing students to social anthropology.  It covers a wide range of topics from an anthropologists' perspective and includes some basic theory.  But the points of emphasis and continuity between lectures are confusing as are some of the assignments.  Also, the material often was specific to the professor, so would change under a different course head.</comment>A great intro to anthropology. You cover a breadth of topics in a practical and applicable way!</comment>Professor Herzfeld is great, unfortunately he was only here for the semester. He and Bronwyn are the reasons to take this course. If they are not teaching it, I would not recommend this course.</comment>If it's taught by another professor and the syllabus looks interesting, perhaps give it a try. If it's with Prof. Herzfeld, don't take it.</comment>Absolutely fantastic! Worth taking!</comment>this class is interesting and fun- be sure to be on top of your readings so you can get the most out of lecture</comment>This course is a must for anyone considering anthropology, especially if you feel you don't yet understand it. Be wary of the instructor. Herzfeld is prone to tangents and repetition. Lectures were regularly a review of his travel stories more than they were an explication of anthropological concepts. Still, he is a veteran anthropologist with a full and vibrant understanding of the field.</comment>Make sure Bronwyn is your TF.... and keep up to date on the readings.</comment>This is supposed to be an introduction to the basics of social anthropology but fails to live up to that name. The course is changing, as I understand it, which will be for the better.</comment>The course is not hard and is infused with some interesting threads in anthropology academically and in its real world application, which is awesome!</comment>Professor Herzfeld is an excellent instructor. His enthusiasm for the material and for your learning is inspiring.</comment>Unfortunately this class was the epitome of the downside of studying social sciences at Harvard. Prof. Herzfeld, while he tried very hard and made himself accessible outside of class, would everyday espouse a politically correct political agenda without any nuance and little evidence-based analysis. While many of the topics we discussed such as poverty and racism are terrible, every lecture was a black-and-white David and Goliath story in which neoliberal agendas hurt the little guy. Unfortunately this approach didn't provide any insight into how to actually help or understand people because it refused to do the latter.</comment>You will get out of this course what you put into it. If you choose to engage with the texts and get to know Professor Herzfeld, you will come out of it with an understanding of anthropology and hopefully inspiration to continue this type of thinking.</comment>This class is not a reflection of the Social Anthropology department as a whole.</comment>Often the class just comes across as Herzfeld just discussing his travels, not actually teaching testable material, but then there is an intensive exam on material we don't feel we've been taught. But it's fun and relatively easy.</comment></course>HAA 137p: The Roman Dinner Party: Proseminar</title>This course is very interesting and well formatted, but does require a good amount of independently motivated work.</comment>This is a phenomenally orchestrated class. It deals with questions of power, gender, aesthetics, and how all of this comes together in literature and art. You'll read Juvenal and Petronius; you'll grow familiar with some amazing spaces (Sperlonga! The burial grounds in Pompeii!). You might even watch Fellini's bizarre adaptation of the Satyricon, if you're lucky. Put the time and effort into class preparation and you'll be well rewarded. Take this class if it's offered again. You won't regret it. No one knows how to close read physical space like Professor Bielfeldt. A rare class.</comment>This class was a lot of fun in addition to being a constructive place to work on research and writing. Although the topic for the class seemed narrow at first, the dinner was a good lens through which to view a wide range of topics related to Roman art, so don't let that aspect dissuade you from taking the course.</comment></course>CHEM 171: Biological Synthesis</title>A superb course, among the best in the sciences here, and an absolute must if you're planning on a PhD in any sort of molecular biology, biochemistry, or chemistry field. It's staggering how well Prof. Balskus understands the field and all the decisions involved in trying to biosynthesize a small molecule. You learn a surprising amount of both theory - the different classes of natural products, mechanisms for their formation, etc - and practice - how to screen for products, what kind of experimental design to use, how to go about generating novel products, etc. The class isn't even that hard, either! If you're at all interested, take the course.</comment>Wow, Prof. Balskus has crammed this course full of interesting material. There is so much cool chemistry presented, AND the exams and problem sets are perfectly fair in the way they hold you to that material. A truly well designed and taught class.</comment>This class is a good introduction to an emerging, fascinating field, taught with a heavy reliance on primary literature. The first half of the class teaches common enzymatic mechanisms and active site analysis. Having taken 20/30 I felt like I got a lot out of this. The second half teaches engineering strategies and experimental design. It felt somewhat repetitive and not really worth the time spent. Prof. Balskus is an excellent lecturer; there are also a number of guest lectures which were hit and miss.</comment>The first half is more suited to chemistry major/graduate students, while the second half is more suited to biochemistry/chemical biology majors/graduate students.</comment>There is a good amount of work in this class, so if you are going to be busy this semester, I wouldn't take it.</comment>This is a great class if you have an interest in going into research on biological synthesis or want to learn more about biochemistry from a chemists perspective. You'll also get a really good handle on how the pharmaceutical/biotech industries work. However, keep in mind the course is almost entirely graduate students, and a strong preparation (beyond just 1 year of organic chemistry) is probably needed to do well. Problem sets were interesting and manageable, the tests were really long and time-pressured (even for seasoned veterans).</comment>This is a challenging and rewarding course. It is great because it is interdisciplinary. Highly recommended for any aspiring chemistry or biochem/mol bio student. You will learn a lot about the forefront of a currently evolving relevant field. It will give you a unique understanding of the enzymology, synthesis, metabolic engineering, genetics involved in natural product biosynthesis.</comment>Take this class if you enjoy biology! Do not expect a chemistry only course even though it is a 100 level chemistry course! Also expect to be surrounded by graduate students!</comment>It is a good course but may be challenging if you do not find the subject interesting.</comment>Every part of this class was enjoyable - engaging lectures, an interesting and valuable weekly section, problem sets that indicated exactly what skills we should be focusing on, and useful assignments.</comment>This class is a lot of work! If you don't have a strong organic chemistry background, you are going to have to work really hard. Go to office hours as much as you can for the problem sets.</comment>This class is structured in such a way that, for most people, I think it will fall in the "good but not great" category. "Biological synthesis" can mean a lot of things to a lot of people, and that ultimately leads to an interdisciplinary course that doesn't quite commit to one perspective. The good side of that coin is that you'll be exposed to a pretty broad range of science, but because each of these subfields is so different, a) you're not going to get a very strong grounding in any one approach, and b) there'll probably be at least one unit that you just don't really enjoy. I personally would have been happy to trade the lectures about directed evolution for more insights into enzymatic physical organic chemistry, but I talked to plenty of people in the class who wanted just the opposite. All that being said, Emily is one of the best people I can think of to deliver an overview of this subject matter, since her research somehow manages to cover everything in this course. She's also incredibly enthusiastic and knowledgable, and she does a great job emphasizing the applications of her lectures -- the guest lectures were perfectly integrated into the curriculum and really quite interesting. I learned a lot in this course, although that knowledge is definitely of the broad (not so deep) variety.</comment>If you are an organic chemist with little to no background in biological synthesis or biology in general, this is a great course. It will likely change your application of chemistry and give you ideas for new projects and interests to pursue. To all others note that knowledge of organic chemistry is definitely helpful in this class as it is relatively fast paced. Overall if you are willing to review your notes on a weekly basis and put in a good bit of time to study for the exams. This class is very manageable and rewarding. Psets are on the shorter side if you have taken the time to over course material.</comment>If you like biological chemistry take this class, the material is super interesting.</comment>Prof. Balskus definitely enthusiased me about research at the interface of microbiology and organic chemistry. The lectures were incredibly clear and I appreciated how we were encouraged to ask questions. Since taking the class I have been to three independent research seminars which would have been incomprehensible had I not been in the Chem 171 Class - I think this shows how useful and important this class is for anyone considering research in the chemical biology field!</comment>This class is great for those who are interested in the subject material and that have the right background.</comment>A solid class that gives a strong background in enzymology.</comment>Great class with a lot of really interesting material. It's a lot of work to keep up with everything covered in class. The first exam was a bit of a whirlwind in that it was challenging and long, and the exams in general required extreme comfort with the material if one is to get anywhere near finishing on time (they didn't leave that much time to think). I learned a LOT from the research proposal at the end of the semester, and loved that it was our final project.</comment>If you are interested in the very specific field of using microbes and other organisms for directing the production of molecules, then this is the class for you! However, it is a very specific and focused class. If your interests are not in this area of research and you take this class as a program requirement, then this class is heavily time-consuming (long problem sets each week), difficult and not overly helpful in preparing you to tackle other research goals. Additionally, the length of each of the two exams was over 20 pages and did not allow for adequate time to think about an answer, but required you to begin immediately writing.</comment>The course was well put together and not particularly difficult.  The first and second half of the course were fairly different with the first focusing more on biochemistry and metabolite synthesis and the second half focusing on metabolic engineering.</comment>overall good class. worth taking if you are interested in natural products but know that there is lots of outside work (6 problem sets, 1 news and views, and 1 proposal) plus two exams.</comment></course>LPS A: Foundational Chemistry and Biology</title>It's a very good intro to chemistry, and a decent intro to biochemistry.</comment>I would tell future students to take full advantage of both instructor and TF office hours. The professors genuinely want everyone to succeed and are genuine in answering students' questions. They're also readily available by email. The teaching staff genuinely feels like a team and it's worth developing a relationship with them. I would also tell students to do the practice problems for both the chemistry and biology portions of the class because they're applicable to material covered on both the problem sets and the exams.</comment>This class is what you make of it. It can be difficult and very fast-paced at times, but you can get a lot out of it if you put the time and effort into it and take advantage of all of the help available to you outside of the class. If you keep up with the work and readings and study every once in a while on your own to make sure you are really understanding the concepts, you will do fine.</comment>I thought this was an overall great class! The lectures were easy to follow, the exams were fair, and the professors are so enthusiastic about what they teach. You will come out of this class with a good foundation for both chemistry and biology.</comment>Keep reviewing material from the beginning of the course throughout the second half of the semester.</comment>It is a huge time commitment. I found meeting 8 hours a week to be draining.</comment>That Dr. Tucci is reason enough to take this class.</comment>This is a solid course to get your feet wet in biology and chemistry. At times the course is more engaging than others, but overall it was a positive experience for me in my freshman fall.</comment>If you are the kind of student that struggles in science or math, you need to be able to set aside a lot of your time to go to office hours. The instructors will help you as much as they can in office hours and you will feel a lot better. If you have a strong background in science or math, you should be able to do very well in this class if you spend a few hours every week going over the materials you learned.</comment>Even though it doesn't require any previous courses, a knowledge of AP Chem and AP Bio is very helpful. The pace is fast. LS1a covered much less material and had no midterms, while LPSa went through all of AP Bio and AP chem in one semester with 3 midterms and a final.</comment>This course requires quite a bit of effort and time.  For me, the chemistry portion of the class was particularly difficult, and the exams were very disappointing.</comment>Do the reading</comment>Do not assume it is an easier class than LS1A, it has a different approach.</comment>Overall, I loved this course! Dr. Tucci is an amazing, and the entire teaching staff is always accessible. The exams were very fair, and there was always help for anyone who needed it, including teaching staff office hours, TF office hours, problem solving review sessions, and practice problem sessions. It was a great course that I would strongly recommend anyone to take!</comment>Gregg Tucci is an amazing professor, and you get a very rounded overview of chemistry and biology concepts.</comment>Great class. well organized and makes sense.</comment>This class is worth every minute.  The teaching staff is great and always willing to help.  The class will take time and is difficult but the amount of knowledge you gain is worth it.  This is a great class to start off with if you are interested in science.</comment>They expect a lot from you. I had something for this class, lecture, lab, or section, every day of the week.</comment>Although this course is supposedly easier than LS1A, I still found it to be appropriately challenging. Lectures with Gregg Tucci are engaging and enjoyable to attend. While Tamara Brenner is a competent lecturer, I found her to be less inspiring, and I attended fewer of the biology lectures as a result. I found that it wasn't necessary to attend every lecture as long as I kept up with the notes and went to section. The problem solving review sessions were usually unnecessary unless I felt I needed extra help with the material. Overall, this course is a good choice and allows you to choose your own level of participation. The workload is manageable, and I would recommend this course to anyone considering LPSA or LS1A.</comment>LPSA does not necessarily cover less material than LS1A, but is more structured in that the chemistry and biology are presented separately and problems are straight forward. However, it would be beneficial to have a decent knowledge of chemistry and biology before taking this. Also, the biology part is very dry and is hard to pay attention to.</comment>This class is not difficult, provided you stay on top of your work, since the material tends to build on itself. The course instructors are all excellent people, and I think anybody would enjoy taking LPS A.</comment>if you go to office hours for help with p-sets, you'll do great</comment>A background in chemistry and biology would be very helpful.</comment>Take advantage of all of the resources that this class offers, including practice exams, lecture videos, review lectures, help rooms, office hours, and guided problem solving. This class is what you make of it.</comment>TAKE THIS COURSE OVER LS1A. BUT, do not get fooled and believe that this is "easy". This class will lead to many late nights and unless you have a group of friends to do psets with or study with you will not like this class, let alone survive. Please try it if you're pre-med and use it to judge whether you want to continue as a pre-med. It will challenge you but ask for help! WHATEVER YOU DO, ASK FOR HELP. HINKLE IS BAEE!!</comment>This class is good for learning the fundamental concepts behind chemistry and biology, but make sure you stay caught up with the work and learning in order to stay on top of things.</comment>If you are worried about your Bio or Chem background, take this class. They go back to basics and build from there so you'll really understand. Also Dr. Tucci is an amazing lecturer.</comment>I would say take ls1a.</comment>This is a good class and easy to do well in if you go to lecture and go to section. Biology portion of the lecture can be a bit of a bore sometimes but chemistry lectures are definitely quite interesting.</comment>If you're not willing to put in extra work outside of class, don't take this class.</comment>This class will go quickly if you haven't got any chemistry background. Make sure to keep up, ask for help, and do all of the practice problems for each week. I took AP chemistry, but I struggled in it, and I feel like taking LPSA clarified everything I wasn't entirely sure how to figure out. The chemistry side of the course is much more intensive than the biology.</comment>It's a good class. Be prepared to put in work for the p-sets. The bio section is harder than the chem section for most people. Don't think it's an easy A, but you can easily get an A as long as you put in work.</comment>Take this class over LS 1a</comment>LPSA will give you a solid foundation in biology and chemistry. The course staff is completely committed to making sure you are successful in the class. Make sure you put in hours on your part as well. Most of what I learned, I got from the psets and practice problems, so put in the time with those.</comment>Stay on top of your work, go to the guided problem solving reviews, do every single practice problem.</comment>It's harder than LS 1a, so proceed with caution. The entire teaching staff is amazing and is so helpful. You will actually need their help in the course because it is so difficult! If you are stuck between LS 1a and this class DO NOT use your placement as your only reason for taking this class. Talk to the professors, look at the class materials, and use the Q guide. Be prepared for a TON of work. You WILL need to manage your time like Ebenezer Scrooge manages his money, so watch out.</comment>Great intro course</comment>This course is easy to do well in if you put the work in. Don't underestimate the power of studying for the exams. You will do well on the psets, but if you don't study for the exams they won't go... as well as you would hope. Overall, this course is relatively straightforward and interesting. The lab component is well run and fun.</comment>LPS-a is a fun with a great teaching staff. The lectures are fun and the material is presented clearly. Labs are interesting and not too long. The material is interesting and straightforward. A great introduction.</comment>Would take over LS1a. More structured, and more class time to allow for better understanding.</comment>This is truly a wonderful class. The professors are helpful and enthusiastic about the course material and there are so many resources to help you succeed.</comment>The teaching staff is extremely helpful and genuine. If you do not like science then I would not recommend, but if you have any interest in the sciences then I would be sure to recommend.</comment>Very demanding course</comment>Do the practice problems before doing the problem sets it will help you learn the concepts better. Also, starting preparing for the exams will in advance because they cover substantial material and none of the class is curved.</comment>If you do everything that is expected (practice problems included) and go to the reviews and office hours with your questions you will be fine.</comment>It's a class you have to take if you're Premed.. with the new revamp, I suggest taking LS1a but the teaching staff is absolutely amazing and the class is very structured.</comment>This class is an easy class that you learn a lot in.  They walk you through everything clearly.  The chem part is better than the bio part.</comment>The chemistry portion of the course is difficult if you have no prior knowledge of physics, but the material is well taught. Professor Tucci is an amazing professor and I would really recommend taking one of his classes.</comment>This class is exactly what it is presented to be. There are no tricks or gimmicks, all the information given about the course is true. Problem sets and tests are fair, they only cover material that was touched on during lecture or section. The resources available to help students succeed in this course are unsurpassed; the teaching staff is extremely accessible. Overall this was a great class, not easy by any means, but I learned a lot.</comment>There is as much help as you can possibly need, and the instructors are so nice and so helpful.</comment>Only take this class if you absolutely have no background in either chemistry or biology. Otherwise, LS1A is probably a more appropriate class.</comment>This course is extremely fast paced so stay on top of your work!</comment>Do yourself a favor and take LS1a. The midterm system is ineffective and is designed to keep too many students from getting an A. LS1a is equivalent and a majority of people get A's there.</comment>It's a good class. You'll learn a lot. Sometimes it feels kind of tedious or boring.</comment>LPS A is a great intro-level integrated biology/chemistry course. The emphasis on chemistry for the first half of the semester proves invaluable in the second half, when you will be asked to use those chemical properties in understanding and explaining biological processes. Overall, a well-taught course that pulls together both subjects in a meaningful way while also providing a solid base in each individual subject.</comment>Take the class.  When you do, study for the exams by taking all the practice exams without looking at the answers.  You win.</comment>LPSA is a good way to learn the basics of chemistry and biology and have a solid foundation for future science classes. The problem sets were manageable and the exams were not bad if you study.</comment>Recommend to people very interested and pretty good at science</comment>Way easier than LS1A but hard to get up at 9am for. Luckily lectures are videotaped and notes are posted online, but its bad to become too reliant on these.</comment>Dr. Tucci and Dr. Brenner are amazing. I really liked the layout of the course as far as the pset assignments, weekly review sessions, and sections are concerned. My friends in LS1a seemed to dislike the psets, but I found the LPSa psets relatively easy, shorter (since there's one a week vs. one every two weeks), and more helpful.</comment>- great class
- for beginners and intermediates
- simply requires a bit of preparation and interest</comment>Check and see how LS 1a is formatted. This year LS 1a was the course to take, not LPS A. I would also tell them that this course is a good course, but be aware of the ridiculously early 9 am lecture time. It was a huge turn-off.</comment>This course is very comparable to LS1A and I would take LS1A over this. There is less class time in LS1A and the ICEs make it more manageable.</comment>If you have to take it for pre-med, take it.</comment>Great intro class! Couldn't really imagine it being laid out any better.</comment>hard and requires a lot of dedication to succeed</comment>There are a lot of resources available and if you understand the psets, practice problems, and lectures, you will do fine in the course! Very well structured and the work load is pretty constant.</comment>TAKE LS1A! It was hard to have tests count so much for your grade and I feel the small quizzes that LS1A did better prepared students along the way. Although, LPSA probably prepared me better for what a real science course at Harvard would be like.</comment>This is a wonderful class. I had a strong Chem background and was very comfortable the first half of the class. My biology background was very week which is why I chose this class over LS1a, I had to work a lot more the second part of the class but it was entirely manageable. 

You have so many resources including help rooms, practice problems, office hours, guided problem solving, problem solving lectures... The professors and teaching staff really want to see you succeed and learn the materiel and are very helpful.

I loved how enthusiastic the two professors are and how much they enjoy teaching, they even make an effort to learn everyone's names!</comment>I would not recommend this course because there was so much work for this course. The Psets seemed like busy work and the class was not rewarding because the exams were so hard, so no matter how much I studied, I still felt like I did horrible on the exams.</comment>It is a fun and practical way to fulfill a gen ed requirement. Great intro class for students interested in going into life sciences.</comment>Great class, learn more and better prepared than with LS1a</comment>It gets harder with time. Be sure to do the practice problems and turn in the problem sets on time.</comment>LPSA is well-structured, but there are a TON of assignments (12), labs (9), and exams (3 midterms and 1 final). The chem portion of the class was great and super easy since I have already taken thermodynamics and a quantum/crystalography class. However, the biology portion is really dry and confusing. It's hard to make the switch between the 2 subjects. The exams are reasonable as long as you keep up with the assignments and course material. The labs were unnecessarily long and tedious. Overall, I definitely learned some stuff, but I'm not sure if it was worth the time. However, I had to take this class to get an SLS gen ed.</comment>This course is extremely well taught and makes learning chemistry fun!</comment>This class is a really good class to take if you want to go into science but didn't take AP Chem in high school. It definitely isn't an easy class, but everything you need to succeed is given to you by the professors/ teaching staff, it's just a matter of finding the time to do all the optional work that is key to doing well in the class.</comment>LPSA is such a fun class! It does require a lot of class time during the week and the midterms require a lot of studying, but the course heads and TFs provide so much help and review sessions that you are never alone. The lectures have a fun, relaxed atmosphere.</comment>Despite this being an intro course, you definitely need a chem and bio background to succeed in this course.</comment>This is one of the best structured classes. I have learned so much in a surprisingly short amount of time. It is a great way for those who feel that they do not have a solid chemistry or biology background to build that up. It is a lot of information, however. If you are willing to take advantage of the resources given to you, such as office hours, review sessions, sections, you will succeed in this class.</comment>Interesting material but a lot of class time.</comment>Go to the lectures, even though they are at 9am and online, the lectures make all the difference.</comment>The course covered a lot of material that will probably be useful in higher biology and chemistry courses, and it was at times engaging (with Tucci lecturing).  However, I have a lot of complaints. I think the biology portion should be retooled. The lectures for that portion don't seem to relate to the p-sets and exams, in that the lectures are quite basic, and then there is a huge leap in knowledge and application for the problems. I also found the practice exams were also always much easier than the actual exams, which I found disingenuous. You definitely need to have taken AP Chemistry and AP Biology. The course moves really fast, and if you've only had basic science you'll be struggling and behind everyone else who had more high school preparation.  Take it because you have to, but don't expect to enjoy it.</comment>TAKE IT IF YOU MUST. If you have taken AP Biology and AP chemistry in high school, you won't learn anything new, but the information and the exams will be presented in a way that even if you already know the material well, you will only do well if you learn the material in the way that THEY teach it. It's an odd course. Also, 9AM lectures suck, and they are recorded, so halfway through the semester I just couldn't get myself to go to lecture anymore (and I'm not one to miss class a lot). Part of the reason I stopped going to lecture was because of Tamara Brenner's lecturing style. It is difficult to stay focused for an hour as opposed to when Tucci lectures, which is very interesting. Labs are fun and easy and I met cool people in my lab. Good luck</comment>This class is good for anyone who wants to take an introductory science class.  It encompasses a lot of material, yet it is somewhat easier than LS1a.  Dr. Tucci is the bomb and is amazing, making me enjoy chem which I did not think was possible.  I wouldn't take this solely for the SLS GenEd, but if you are interested in taking higher-level science classes, this is the class to take for the introductory level.</comment>The teaching staff is amazing - they are friendly, willing to help, and accessible. They really know how to prepare students. The course is split in two - chemistry in the first half, biology in the second half. The course has lecture three times are week, taught by the professors. Then there are sections taught by TFs throughout the week to apply what you learned in lecture. On Friday there is a review section taught by the preceptors. There is a lab section one day a week, almost every week. There are lots of office hours to get help, and the teaching staff are really responsive.</comment>You'll love Dr.Tucci. Dr.Brenner is a toss up.</comment>In general lectures were easy to follow and material was easy to understand. Problem sets were not very hard. Exams increased with difficulty as the semester went on. Exams often contained difficult application questions.</comment>This class was a great intro into chemistry and biology. The lectures are great and the fact that the lecture notes are given and also put online is extremely helpful. The labs are fun and help you understand the material. Overall, a great class especially if you haven't had too much background in either chemistry or biology.</comment>From what I've now heard about the LS1A overhaul, students would have a more manageable time taking LS1A.</comment>Keep up with the practice problems and try to go over lecture notes on a weekly basis and compile study guides for exams. Then create a cumulative study guide for the final.</comment>I would tell students that they must take the time to learn the material well and not wait until the last minute to do assignments and study.</comment>It's a very well run, simple chem/bio course. Lab is not bad at all. Dr. Tucci, Brenner and Hinkle are all great. Casey is not the nicest person. I would take it as a gen ed if you have any interest in life sciences and want a really easy course.</comment>Take advantage of the help network that is in place--it is extensive and very helpful.</comment>This class is pretty solid. If you have a good background in biology and chemistry, it will be pretty easy and a review of the material you learned in AP high school classes. Dr. Tucci is an awesome lecturer and keeps the class interesting as well.</comment>Gregg is amazing, Brenner is alright. I went into this course with a strong background in Chem and a weak background in bio, so I basically glided with no effort for the first half of the semester and then had to work a little in the second half.</comment>Have your Chemistry on point before you come to this class. It is by no means easy like they try to convince you. Be prepared to struggle</comment>i struggled in the class</comment>This class helps one build a solid foundation in the science fields as well as learning important life lessons such as time management.</comment>If you are considering pre-med definitely take this class. It also fills a lot of different science concentration requirements.  It is very laid back and all the instructors of the course want to help you.</comment>Best way to get my concentration requirement for basic chem and bio done. Tucci is a charismatic lecturer.</comment>Great teaching! Not hard at all!</comment>Better taught and more fun that LS1a, highly recommended, Tucci makes it very enjoyable.</comment>It is a good way to determine if you want to pursue Biology and Chemistry-related careers.</comment>Don't take it unless you are going into the sciences.</comment>If you're deciding between this and LS1A and have took AP Bio/Chem in hs just go with LS1A. I think they've made ls1a much more straightforward and less stressful than LPSA with their quizzes instead of midterms.</comment>This course was a great introduction to chemistry and biology. The professors make the material very understandable in lecture especially by providing printed copies of the lecture slides to take notes on. They are also very accessible in office hours and try to learn the name of many of the students despite the fact that there are hundreds of students.</comment>It's a manageable and enjoyable class.  I would definitely recommend it if you enjoy science and plan to do something related to science in the future.</comment>Utilize the large staff and support that is offered in this class. The material gets hard pretty quickly, so you have to be prepared for more difficult assignments.</comment>This is a great introductory class and if you are given countless opportunities to ask for help in office hours or help sessions!!! You can easily email your TF, or even Dr. Tucci and they'll back to you almost immediately. Work in groups to do psets and you'll do great on them. Make sure you do practice problems and practice tests and you'll be fine on tests.</comment></course>ENGLISH 115b: Chaucer: The Canterbury Tales</title>This class is very interesting - Professor Watson is an excellent lecturer, and our study of the tales - usually one per class - was fascinating. We really got to look at the source material and context of the different tales, which was very informative. Workload was very fair. The class should hold students more accountable, though, and more opportunities for discussion and small group work and projects would be nice.</comment>This is an excellent course for english concentrators and general education students alike. Professor Watson is accessible, enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and hard-working, and Chaucer is challenging but rewarding.</comment>This class is really fantastic. Prof Watson is so enthusiastic about this literary work and has so much background in medieval history and literature that he can really make it come to life. The tales are so diverse and being able to study them in context is so completely rewarding. And you learn to read and semi-speak in Middle English!!</comment>Not a lot of work each week. However, there are only one paper, a presentation and a final paper, and the grading is very subject to your T.F. So although it is a relatively light workload, it is hard to get a good grade, especially since a lot of the people taking the class were english majors/knew things about old english.</comment>This is a great course! The lectures are really interesting and section is amazing. I would definitely recommend it.</comment>This class is a great choice for both English concentrators and non-humanities students alike. If you've ever wanted an extremely comprehensive education on one of the most interesting works of Middle English literature, take this course. Professor Watson is a fantastic lecturer and the material truly comes alive in his passion and enthusiasm for what he discusses. The workload is very fair; only a little reading for every class based on what Tale we are discussing for that day. I had Deborah as a TF and she is very proficient at encouraging discussion and shedding light on some of the more baffling parts of the Tales. The assignments are manageable and the grading, while not lenient, is not unreasonable either. Overall, a good choice for students of all backgrounds.</comment>The quizzes are rough. The sections are also fairly unstructured. But the lectures are fantastic!</comment>The Canterbury tales is a very entertaining read, and even those who might not like the idea of Middle English literature might change their minds. Lectures analyze certain aspects of each Tale, while discussion in class broadens understanding of the Tale as a whole. However, as a freshman who had not taken an Expos course, I had difficulty writing papers because this is not an introductory level English class.</comment>This is a fun class, and I definitely am glad that I've read the Canterbury Tales. That said, I had quite a bit of trouble slogging through the readings, and you have to devote quite a lot of time to the class.</comment>This class is a blast, especially section. However, the only thing is that it's Middle English, so unless you can actually see yourself reading Middle English, I wouldn't take it.</comment>Though the lectures were quite ingenious and entertaining, I felt that I did not personally find the material itself very gripping. This is not the fault of the professor by any means. Take this class if you are interested in Chaucer or medieval literature - while I didn't particularly love the material, I did gain a deep appreciation for Chaucer.</comment>As a premed student, I would have never typically have enrolled in this course. But due to the encouragement from friends, I could not be happier that I did. Watson is awesome!!</comment>This class is an excellent Gen Ed course. The coursework is light; the lectures are interesting; and section can also be rewarding (depending on how much reading you do). Professor Watson is incredibly enthusiastic about his field, which makes lectures far more engaging. Although reading Middle English may be intimidating, if you put in some time at the beginning of the course to get a grip on the language, it will really pay off later in the course.</comment>This class is fantastic and Professor Watson is great.  The class is lecture based so there is not a lot of opportunity to have a two-way dialogue about the tales in class.  However, section is enriching and the section leaders are all great.</comment>Great class, but I got a little bored of the tales at the end. It would be great to read other works by Chaucer</comment>Super easy, I hardly went to lecture. I wish the class felt a bit more relevant and that the text of the Canterbury Tales wasn't so dull but I would generally say that you can get through this class with minimal effort, only doing the relevant readings for essays and just skimming/reading online summaries for section quizzes. Overall a forgettable class, but the professor is awesome in lecture and loves the material so that helps.</comment>Keep up with the tales and you'll be just fine!</comment>I am a senior statistics concentrator.  Other than Stat 110, this has been my favorite class at Harvard.  Professor Watson knows what he's doing and the Canterbury Tales are amazing (and so great in Middle English).</comment>Professor Watson is really great, very approachable and engaging.  Also, learning to read middle English is pretty cool as well.</comment>Absolutely take this course if you can.  Professor Watson is an absolutely amazing lecturer, he generates massive enthusiasm for the material.  If you haven't read the Canterbury Tales, just take this course.  Don't even think about it.  They aren't hard, they are super fun, and Watson makes them even better.  Get Helen as your TF if you can, she makes it even better!</comment>Professor Watson is a brilliant professor who is clearly one of the world's foremost authorities on the Canterbury Tales. This class exposes you to a fantastic work of literature that you may not otherwise have the time/chance/desire to read. Assignments are extremely fair (1 paper, 1 group presentation, 1 final paper or project, weekly quizzes in section) and are meant to appeal to students from all disciplines, not just English concentrators.</comment>It's interesting with a manageable workload! Do it!</comment>It's amazing. For someone who doesn't love wishy washy stuff about modern literature- this focuses on literary and English analysis in a historical framework that makes it so much more interesting. The teaching is unparalleled and it was one of the best courses I took at Harvard. I love Chaucer</comment>If it were a smaller class, it would be better.</comment>One of the best classes I've taken at Harvard. Professor Watson was entertaining, engaging, and insightful, and I really learned a lot about how to read poetry in such a way that you derive meaning from it you otherwise might have missed. Sections were small, which resulted in my section group becoming very comfortable and very close with one another (which in turn caused us to have much better discussions too). Definitely a class worth taking.</comment>One of the better ways to fulfill AIU, especially if you need specifically a literature class (for premed reqs, etc.). People generally shy away from the Canterbury Tales because they 1) are in Middle English (and presumably indecipherable) and 2) seem pretty boring. But the language gets easier to understand as you acquire more experience with it - if you did Shakespeare in high school it's basically the same thing - and the tales themselves can be pretty entertaining (and bawdy at times). There are duds, but the good thing is that you only have to deal with them for one class. The assignments - a 5-page paper, presentation, and 10-page final paper - are relatively painless, and the amount of reading is fairly low: at most maybe 25 pages of verse per class period. Professor Watson's interpretation of the Tales makes for pretty entertaining lecture, although class does sometimes grow stale after a while. All in all, a pretty decent Gen Ed and not a class you'd regret taking.</comment>Reading Middle English is weird and takes getting used to. If you just want an English class but don't want to basically learn a new language, move on.</comment>Taking this course as a science concentrator, I thought this was an excellent choice to get my feet wet in serious study of literature while knocking out a Gen-ed in a fun manner. The reading will take some time and the final paper/project may seem difficult, but Professor Watson and the TFs provide a great number of resources to facilitate creative interpretation of the Tales. Among the most fulfilling courses I have taken at Harvard.</comment>The material is difficult, but it's a very refreshing look at Chaucer's most famous piece.  If you're willing to put a bit of effort in, this class is more than worth it!</comment>Engaging class. Would highly recommend as a Gen Ed or elective.</comment>Great course to take if you want to have a taste of Middle English. Although you have probably read the Canterbury Tales in high school, it is a really rewarding experience to reread and rethink about a lot of the tales under Professor Watson's guidance.</comment>This was a fantastic course. That being said, only take it if you really like Chaucer (or see yourself being able to enjoy his works). Many tales are hilarious, and Professor Watson's lectures are always fantastic, but some of the tales are dry and monotonous. At times during the semester I found myself getting a little bored. However, the teaching staff keeps things exciting! Plus, the ability to read Middle English is a fantastic (albeit completely useless) skill to impress your friends and family! Overall, I had a great time! The workload is mild, to say the least. If you want a chance to engage deeply with one of the greatest works of English literature ever, take this course!</comment>I would definitely recommend this class to both people looking to fulfill a gen ed or just a weird elective.  It was a lot of fun and not a lot of work, and I really learned a of cool stuff while reading one of the most influential works in the English language.</comment>THIS CLASS IS AWESOME. The canterbury tales and medieval literature in general are the most fascinating thing. Ever. Professor Watson is hilarious. It's a perfect amount of reading per week, and the assignments are great. The group project is a little annoying. This was by far my favorite class of the semester.</comment>Professor Watson is an incredible lecturer! He is extremely passionate about Middle English literature. As long as you go to lecture and section, you will have no problems with this course (and might even become an expert in the Canterbury Tales).</comment>This course is fantastic. While my TF seemed to grade the essays very capriciously, and other TFs were definitely easier graders, the heart and soul of the course is Professor Watson and his lectures, which are absolutely fantastic. I would highly recommend the class. It was one of my top three classes at Harvard.</comment>Nicholas is a wonderful lecturer. The reading can be dry and a lot to get through since it's in Middle English, but lecture and section will help you appreciate it.</comment>Awesome course! Prof Watson's enthusiasm for this subject is just so infectious you can't help but love this class. The sections were really interesting and hearing the thoughts of fellow students provided me with some of my greatest insights of the class.</comment>This is a fantastic course that will give you a great appreciation for Chaucer. Don't be intimidated by the Old English, Watson has a really fantastic way of explaining the material and teaching students how to read it!</comment>NA</comment>This course was really great! Lectures were very worth attending, the professor and teaching staff were friendly and responsive, and the course material was meaningful. To read a whole text from beginning to end provided a sense of closure. The assessments in this course were flexible enough to allow most students to create an academic product they liked.</comment>I took this class for AI. Probably more difficult and more time intensive than your typical gened.</comment></course>LITER 149: Writing the World: Literature and Its Theories</title>This course has an amazing syllabus that only gets better once you are in class discussing the works, both theoretical and literary. The professor is brilliant and it is amazing to be in her presence, for every week I walked away from class more and more amazed not only at how much the texts had been opened up through our discussions, but also at how excited I was to get started on the next set of readings.</comment>This is one of the best courses I've taken at Harvard. Professor Ungureanu is so enthusiastic about the material--it's infectious. She makes you feel like you're learning something of great import, and you want to do the reading because she chose great texts and because you want to be able to participate to your fullest. She's happy to help you during the essay process. She's also infinitely understanding. Every course she recaps everyone's blog postings, making sure to show how different people thought of the literature differently in order to ignite a conversation. Take this class!</comment>Delia is an EXCELLENT professor. She's enthusiastic, cares about her students, and has some really fantastic ideas. I also LOVED the books we had to read. This is what a class should feel like – you look forward to each lesson, and homework feels like pleasure reading.</comment>You will learn the most if you read and make an effort to understand and form opinions about all of the texts for each week. This course will affect the way you read, and it will invite you to both revisit some of your favorite texts and read new ones with a keener, more profound eye.</comment></course>ECON 1432: Economics of European Integrations</title>Great teaching staff with interesting, relevant material. I liked that we were able to go deep into the topics we decide to write for our response papers and term paper, but because there are no psets and midterm/final, I don't feel motivated to actually learn all the materials presented in lectures, which is quite a shame. Also, this class can be quite disorganized.</comment>If you want a course that challenges your thinking, and a great teacher who infuses you with knowledge, you should definitely pick Ec 1432.</comment>This is an excellent course that is taught by an expert in European economics. You will learn to appreciate the academic process of writing a term paper and participating in a conference with your peers.</comment>The professor is very knowledgeable and he likes to incorporate current affairs into the lectures. This facilitates an easier understanding of the economic frameworks learnt in class. However, a lot of times not all of the slides were covered during the lecture, which meant that these had to be studied independently at home in order to be able to follow the following lectures.</comment>90% of the time, you never have to do any work for this class, but if you do indeed turn up to lecture & do the readings, it's pretty interesting.</comment>Great way to complete the writing requirement. The class is very interactive and engaging. If you actually participate in class, you'll learn a ton about European economics. I would be careful about the final paper as you need to make sure to get guidance and be proactive about it!</comment>Interesting course, but a lot of reading. Too much.</comment>Do the press review before each class. The discussion at the beginning of class is very interesting and useful.

Try not to fall asleep during lectures by engaging in the questions with the professor and, ideally, with other fellow students.</comment>The assignments for the course were fair and the instruction from Prof. Kotz was excellent. The evening section times were annoying though. Would recommend taking the course pass/fail</comment>Take this class if for no other reason than to get to know Professor Kotz. He is the kindest, most considerate, gentle-hearted teacher I have met at Harvard, and it comes through every day in class, from his very demeanor. He will also encourage you to go to seminars by brilliant economists visiting from Europe which are highly worth attending, and I would never have known about them otherwise.</comment>Good grades for a fair amount of effort. 
Both the professor and the teaching fellow are brilliant. The professor has worked at the board of the German central bank for several years and is a McKinsey senior advisor. He will provide you with very recent, high-quality input (e.g. Investment bank's reports about topical issues). However, the professor should speed up the course and make it more challenging</comment>This is a good class to take for a wide range of people.  Due to the open-endedness of the assignments, you can write your papers on just about anything you want related to Europe (trade policy, financial markets, central banks, taxes, etc.).  The workload is also pretty light.</comment>Very good class for writing requirement</comment>Kotz is a really nice guy and a good teacher. You get what you give in this one.</comment>Lectures might be a bit dull at times, but it is definitely a worthwile experience given how applicable the tools one cultivates throughout the course are. Professor Kotz is a great economist and Pieter was an excellent TF whose sections were extremely useful thanks to his expertise.</comment></course>ENG-SCI 125: Mechanical Systems</title>On of the best MechE classes. Katia is energetic and a good lecturer and is quite helpful outside of class too. Lectures were so good I didn't even really need the book, just used my lecture notes for the pests. Exams weren't easy but pretty fair and doable.</comment>Extremely good course and very important for any mechanical engineer. Strongly suggest you take it even if you are in other forms of engineering.</comment>If you're planning on taking this course it is most likely because you are required to. Be prepared for a class thats mostly math and not very much 'engineering.'</comment>Concise, clear, straightforward teaching. Could easily have been much harder to learn this material. One of the stronger SEAS courses.  Course features a lot of spring-dashpot-mass and free body diagram type physics questions you're used to from AP physics. Material towards the end of the class becomes similar to what is taught in AM 105. The final group project is not too time consuming with a decent team, and there are no surprises in the psets. Lecture notes are acceptable as an occasional replacement for attending lecture if you're into that sort of thing.  Know MATLAB before taking this class. If you don't know MATLAB, be sure to be diligent about OHs and section and start early, otherwise you will not know how to do some problems towards the middle/end of the semester.  Katia is a cool person and is very helpful and friendly. Recommended class.</comment>Katia is a great lecturer, and the class is very well balanced. Basic concept eventually open doors to various other topics, of which Katia touches upon in the final month. Psets don't take more than 8 hours, and average probably 5 or 6. Labs this year are still uninteresting, but the final project is enjoyable.</comment>Good class</comment>Katia is awesome. One of the chillest professor I've ever had.</comment>Katia is a great professor. The class is fair, organized, and interesting. The material is pretty math-heavy, and the psets are sometimes pretty difficult, but if you make use of OH and section, you'll be fine.</comment>The material is not that difficult, and lectures have a good format. However, the assignments were very long and tedious. They weren't that difficult, but single questions could take about 2 hours to get through. I feel like a lot of this class was teaching you to be a human calculator. Most of the time spent on problems was spent solving differential equations, not actually doing mechanical systems analysis. The labs were a nightmare. This year, we were randomly assigned to groups we had to work in the whole semester. It was so difficult to find a time we could all meet, and I feel like some of the frequencies we had to achieve were impossible. We just randomly guessed and checked values, and received no support from the teaching staff. Also, the final project was crap. We spent so much time building an egg-drop apparatus, only to be screwed over by a flaw in the scoring. The group that won ended up breaking their egg every single time, but they were rewarded for having such a light, short system. If you take this class, you should probably just tape a spring to the platform and then you will win for sure.</comment>Very important class and the problems are fun.  Difficult tests and psets--allot a lot of time for the psets.</comment>Start problem sets early.</comment>This course did a good job of teaching the material, especially reducing oscillating systems to simpler analogues and solving their equations of motion.  Although I thought it a generally weaker course than Physics 15b, I think that the overall teaching structure and strategy is good.</comment>ES 125 was by far the best course I've taken in SEAS. Professor Bertoldi gave awesome lectures that were super useful, and she almost never asked questions on the PSets that were on material that she hadn't covered. The PSets were certainly tedious with really ugly, irrational numbers and definitely required you to use your head a bit, but they were a lot of fun to do and were never absurdly difficult. I feel that we learned some very powerful tools in this course, and it was one of the most important courses that I've taken for my Mechanical Engineering concentration so far. I'd love to take more classes with Katia, because this one was really great. Don't miss out on it!</comment></course>EXPOS 20.191: The Rise of China</title>The class had some interesting points, but could also be quite dry</comment>Kind of too much work</comment>As with all Expos, you don't learn nearly enough about the topic as you'd like and spend much more time on writing processes, which some people need far more help with than others. For Expos, this is a decent course, and is certainly relevant to this day and age, but it's not as fun as I expected.</comment>This course is graded harshly, at least if Sara teaches it, so be mindful of that when you choose the course.</comment>Very interesting and informative about the world's hold with China.</comment>You have to be a pretty strong writer going in to this course to do well. Sara is a good teacher in section and the readings are interesting, but she is a tough marker and you have to be prepared to meet her high expectations!</comment>One of the better Expos topics, based on discussions with other students. I think that it was an interesting class which touched on a very important topic. I also think that this class helped me with the "big-picture" components of academic writing, which is useful.</comment>Difficult expos class. Only take it if you have experience with or are looking for experience with social science writing and theoretical papers</comment></course>CHNSE 132a: Advanced Conversational Cantonese</title>Chen Laoshi is an incredibly understanding and empathetic teacher who is committed to helping you improve your Cantonese. It was always clear that she wanted the course to be the best that it could be and often asked for feedback. She incorporated a variety of teaching methods, and my fluency increased tremendously over the course of the semester.</comment></course>LATIN 121: Petronius and Apuleius</title>This is a great class for those passionate about Rome and the Latin language! The two novels, Petronius' Satyricon and Apuleius' Golden Ass/Metamorphoses are very entertaining. You will learn not only about the clever style of these two authors, but also about the Roman novel and literature as a whole, Roman society, and ancient religion. Be prepared for the level and amount of reading. Both authors write at a fairly advanced level, and Apuleius is especially challenging. Expect to be reading 100-200 lines per class. You're Latin will greatly improve and the small class setting provides some very interesting discussion!</comment>Fantastic</comment>Take this class! The Satyrica and Metamorphoses are hysterical and fascinating works.</comment>This is an excellent opportunity to practice your reading skills at a manageable but moving pace. Come to each class having done the reading, as it will be obvious if you haven't and missing several readings will catch up on you.</comment>This class was a wonderful and very engaging course. The balance between translation and conversation was perfect and greatly enriched my appreciation for the ancient novel. The Latin text was always entertaining, class discussions were always well-facilitated and engaging, and in-class translations were most helpful.</comment>Do the translations and readings! They're hard at first, but the work is very rewarding.</comment></course>MCB 101: Human Genetics</title>This is a nice discussion based course. It consists almost entirely of reading papers, so if you want to improve on that then this is a nice opportunity to do so. If you already got proficient at that through MCB 52/54, then it might not necessarily be the best use of your time. Hunter compiled a nice reading list for this course, but you might already be familiar with a lot of the topics from prior courses.</comment>If you are interested in human genetics and enjoy reading scientific literature (or wish to become better at reading and writing about scientific literature), take this course. You will read an amazing number of journal articles on a wide range of topics in human genetics. The assignments are designed to help you improve your ability to critically evaluate primary research through both discussion and writing. Be prepared for a significant reading load. Scientific papers can be relatively short, but they are dense and you need to be prepared to discuss and critique your article or assigned data figures in great detail for each session. One problem of this course is that judging the quality of scientific writing is a highly subjective process. I wrote in a way that previous science professors at Harvard had encouraged and awarded high grades, but my scores in this class were often not much better than mediocre. It is thus critically important to bring drafts to the professor and teaching fellow so that you have a clearer understanding of what they expect in your writing (particularly when it comes to the level of detail you include). But also go to office hours simply because Prof. Hunter is such an amiable person and keen on speaking with students about genetics, research, academic issues, etc. Overall, this small seminar-style class was a good experience, and I would definitely recommend it to others interested in human genetics.</comment>Fantastic course if you're interested in human genetics.</comment></course>HISTSCI 247: Current Issues in the History of Medicine: Seminar</title>Every graduate student should take a class consisting of a close reading of books in such a constructive and critically aware environment.</comment>Allan Brandt is a phenomenal instructor. He puts substantial thought into planning the course, carefully selecting the set of books that will be included each year in order to ensure that a wide variety are read. Both the content and structure of the course are great. Every history of medicine student should take the course, but all history of science (and other allied fields—anthropology of medicine, health policy, etc.) can benefit from it. Students preparing to write their dissertations can get a lot out of the discussions of the strengths and weaknesses of the works covered, as they are clearly discussed as *books* and what makes for effective arguments in this format. Allan is extraordinarily generous with his time and support of students—he takes great care to provide substantive, thoughtful feedback as students work on assignments and on the final work submitted.</comment>Even if you are not interested in History or Science as a research field, the topics discussed in class really get at contemporary concerns in medicine and public health that is relevant for everyone. Prepare to see the world differently.</comment>This is one of the best courses I have ever taken at Harvard. Do not miss a chance to learn from Allan Brandt! Great readings and great discussion</comment>Allan Brandt is one of the most passionate and engaged teachers I have had the pleasure of taking a course with. I was amazed at how much time he devoted to each individual student outside of class. Although I know that he was very busy with other obligations outside of his teaching, he was never rushed during our conversations during office hours. He took the time to get to know me both as a student and as a person, and his advice has been incredibly helpful. Allan's love of teaching was clear throughout the semester and I feel very lucky to have taken a class with him.</comment>This class is a gem. It is a great chance to get to know a great professor and read great books. Great great great! Take it! The readings are carefully selected, the discussions are fruitful and cover a wide range of topics, and the assignments are helpful to professional development.</comment></course>COMPSCI 279: Research Topics in Human-Computer Interaction</title>This class consists of reading and discussing human-computer interaction papers in addition conducting original research as the final project. You'll have the chance to talk about HCI for three hours a week and will learn a lot about the field, and it's great to have a chance to talk about design and technology in a seminar setting. Prof Gajos is very knowledgeable and does a great job leading the discussion. I'd highly recommend the class to anyone interested in the topic of the class or HCI in general.</comment>I absolutely loved this course. It truly helped me understand the literature better and grow as an HCI researcher. There are so many interesting projects and works in the field. The workload is pretty manageable overall, but the projects take a bit of time.</comment>This is a great class if you want to get an exposure to various research topics in HCI.</comment>Absolutely fantastic class that will expose you to exciting HCI research and core HCI principles. A lot of work, especially toward the end of the semester with final projects, but a lot of fun with a lot to learn. The laid-back but insightful discussions really make the class.</comment></course>EXPOS 20.046: Darwinian Dating</title>This class is really interesting. The professor really helps improve your writing style and works with you to improve your drafts.</comment>Honestly, this is one of the best Expos classes you can take. It's science-oriented and has some very interesting ideas and discussions that make it a much better option than many of the expos courses offered.</comment>This class is so interesting, and the professor is amazing! Keep in mind, however, that it is very science-oriented.</comment>This class is great if your are into the sciences. If not it can be pretty challenging.</comment>One of the best Expos sections. Do not save your essays for the night before, and write drafts as if they are your final copy. You can do quite well if you put in the time.</comment>If you're expecting a "science class," this won't really be one - it's really focused on writing and the science is very social science-oriented.</comment>You must be able to read data papers and draw information from them</comment>Helps you grow a lot as a writer, maybe sometimes a bit tedious (I don't like writing much) but definitely a class that develops important skills.</comment>This is an amazing class! Everyone who took it, loved it. It can be difficult to get the grade you want, but you won't care because you will learn so much information relevant to your lives.</comment>If you're the science type and have to take a writing course, this is the one for you.</comment></course>ENGLISH 56: Poets: Narrative Poetry</title>Julia is by far my favourite TF. If you like poetry and want to go beyond the scope of a Gen Ed course but are worried you don't have the formal training to deal with more advanced classes, this is the course for you.</comment>Professor Warren and Julia (TF) are excellent. The class requires little to no background knowledge of poets (though of course it can't hurt), so it's a class that really anyone can take. It's easy to not keep up with the readings since you're not constantly being checked up on, but the readings are all essential to classroom discussion and are really beneficial (and of course are integral to the papers and the final). It's one of the classes where the more you put in, the more you get out of it. It wasn't too terribly difficult, but the papers are graded pretty hard so they require time and effort. Professor Warren and Julia are also incredibly understanding!</comment>Poets may seem like one of the more daunting English requirements, but - and trust me, this is coming from someone who did not like poetry AT ALL before taking this class - this course is a great choice even if it wasn't a requirement. Professor Warren's lectures are very laid-back and engaging. Julia is an amazing TF, so warm and enthusiastic that it's hard not to feel the same kind of excitement yourself. The assignments are reasonable and the grading is fair. With the exception of a few of the longer poems, the workload is very manageable (just a few poems every class) especially if you're also taking other English classes at the same time. Overall, the best choice for completing the Poets requirement, and also an excellent choice for just a thorough education on poetry 101.</comment>Take it. Take it with Warren. Take it with Julia. I'm a senior and this is the first time that I've felt that I've actually gained more formal knowledge of what being an English scholar is in college. It's not just about writing papers - time is really spent on learning how to look at and talk about poetry. In addition we also learned some really fun things about the poets as people (some pretty hilarious and scandalous stuff). The final isn't too bad and makes you feel cool and academic when studying for it. Attention is given to everyone - they really want to help you - you get as much as you put in - they're amazing - the poems are great - Narrative Poetry is a misleading title though, it's more of a comprehensive poetry introduction. Julia is amazing. Professor Warren is great. Just do it.</comment>If you love poetry, you will love this class. Professor Warren always brings great insight to class and makes learning about poetry fun.</comment>There is a big focus on the Romantic Era poets, though we also read Milton, Dickenson, Whitman and others.</comment>No Common Ground course is very fun, but I think this is one of the better ones. The readings are interesting (with the exception of Paradise Lost), and Professor Warren and Julia make a good team.</comment>Read!!</comment>This class is great if you are looking for a good background of poetry. Andrew does not stick strictly to narrative poetry though - you will get some, actually many, lyrics and odes in the course. The course is fairly straight forward and pretty chill overall.</comment>This class is a really good introduction to poetry- I came in with no prior experience at all (might have read one or two poems in high school), and I ended up really enjoying the poems and analyzing them. Having said that, there are a lot of assignments (3 papers, 3-4 blog postings for section, 5-6 spontaneous writing assignments in class, a final paper, and a final exam, not including prospectuses for the final and midterm papers), so it keeps you on your toes. Both Andrew and Julia are approachable and great to bounce ideas off, and helpful in that they really know a lot about the poetry and are happy to help you navigate or find a starting point if you're lost.</comment>I had never taken a poetry class, read poetry, or written poetry before taking this class.  Now all I want to do is take poetry classes and read and write poetry all the time.</comment>Great class that goes through some really really important poetry to know. Sometimes it can seem like it doesn't completely have a center and is just shifting through different poets, but that really only happens during the transitions between different eras. Overall a thoroughly enjoyable class, mostly discussion-based. If you want to make the most of it, and make the class better for other students, speak up! Don't let 4 people do 80% of the talking.</comment>It's great! The readings are fun and the staff are incredible.</comment>Well worth your time and energy! Uplifting and mind-expanding. My world is forever enriched by learning to appreciate the beautiful poetry of the English language.</comment>This class gives an amazing, holistic look at English poetry</comment></course>CLAS-STDY 97a: Greek Culture and Civilization</title>Excellent, though non-traditional, course on Greek history. Professor Kosmin is erudite but accessible, and he emphasizes the traditional less-covered aspects of Greek history in a fascinating way.</comment>This is a phenomenal class. Even though it does not fulfill any GenEds, definitely take it if you get the chance. Professor Kosmin is a fascinating lecturer and really wants to get to know his students. The sections were also interesting, and grading was not too difficult.</comment>Thorough history of Ancient Greece. Professor Kosmin is a fantastic lecturer. You will get a lot from this course.</comment>Read all the materials given.</comment>This is a very interesting and engaging class. Both Professor Kosmin and the TFs are amazing, and they do a great job of hitting all the important moments and concepts of Greek history. If you have any interest in this subject, this class is a great way to learn a ton about Greek history without too much work.</comment>Students who seek to receive a strong foundation in ancient Greek history and culture should certainly enroll in this course. Although I had some experience with ancient Greek history, this course wonderfully integrated culture into the story of Greek history, which I found very enriching. Students should have an interest in the material and be sure to stay on top of readings and weekly quizzes to make studying for the midterm and final more manageable.</comment>Beware of this course especially for non classics concentrators. Kosmin is a great lecturer but he runs through so much material in that one hour. It is tough to copy down all the information you need for quizzes/etc. Honestly I would not take this course unless you have to. 97b is much more manageable. The midterms and final exams are terrifying because it is all essays and they give you no idea what the questions will be .</comment>Lots of work (two big papers, a final, weekly quizzes and section responses), but definitely worth it</comment>Professor Kosmin is absolutely amazing. He's a great lecturer and an extremely interesting and knowledgeable guy. This class is an excellent introductory to ancient Greek history!</comment>This class was wonderful! Dr. Kosmin is a gifted lecturer and the teaching fellows are also amazing. I would absolutely recommend it to anybody at all who is willing to do the reading. This course was the highlight of my semester.</comment>This class is fantastic! Anyone who wants to learn about the foundations of Western civilization or revolutionize the way they view history should definitely take this class. Kosmin is an absolute gem and you should not miss out on his class!</comment></course>AFRAMER 90r.j: Kinyarwanda</title>you will love it!</comment>This was my seventh semester of Kinyarwanda. The language is very difficult, but fascinating and beautiful. Dr. Bayingana is a wonderful, dedicated man, and there cannot be many other people in the world more qualified to teach Kinyarwanda at a university level. There's a reason I'm still here after so long.</comment>Bayingana is a wonderful and dedicated instructor and I would recommend his Kinyarwanda courses to anyone!</comment>Dr. Bayingana is one of the best language instructors you can ask for. He has enthusiasm for teaching and he really makes sure that students benefit from the class.</comment></course>STAT 121: Data Science</title>meh</comment>This is a good course to get to know some python and how to use it to implement statistical and machine learning methods. You also get a good exposure to several topics (bayesian statistics, regression, map-reduce, clustering, SVM, random forests) but they are not covered very deeply.   It is a good course if you want to get a taste of different things to see which courses you want to take afterwards. If you want to get a deeper understanding of the topics, the course is definitely not enough.</comment>For a sophomore or junior looking to fill a concentration requirement whike getting solid data analysis, python skills, it's great!</comment>This course was interesting, and it taught me some useful data science skills that I think I could apply to real projects. However, lecture was not very helpful.</comment>This class could be better organized, but the material is very relevant and important especially in a time where big data is so prominent.</comment>Take it if you want to get a survey in data science. It is not rigorous at all, but a good hands-on class the exposes you to many techniques.</comment>Do not take this class!</comment>A great idea for a course, but the execution was botched. Lectures were snoozeworthy. Assignments (except for assignment 5) were poorly written and confusing, which means I spent hours combing through documentation and didn't really learn anything. The course itself wasn't that hard. Not CS-y enough for the CS people, not Stat-y enough for the Stat people.</comment>Hard to follow lectures, though the problem sets can be fun and useful</comment>it's a fun course. not too much work except for the bi-weekly panic sessions of, "holy crap this pset is due tomorrow and i have no idea where to even begin." interesting stuff too, and i really do enjoy coding in python. thought it was pretty manageable if you have a decent CS background. watch out for the final project & getting saddled with a useless TF.</comment>Sure, take this course but ONLY if Irizarry is gone. He might be the single worst professor at Harvard.</comment>This class is essentially a glorified python tutorial. The psets suck if you start them the day before (like me!!!) but they're honestly not that difficult, particularly if you know python (unlike me), and they were every two weeks. My roommates also frequently forgot I was in this class because lecture is pointless and so all you really have to do is do a pset every two weeks.</comment>I think this class has a ton of potential. The field of data science is incredibly interesting, and it is definitely becoming more and more relevant. This class, however, struggles to capture much of the excitement in data science. I'd  love to see more engaging lectures that talked about some of the awesome things data scientists do and how it affects industry, as well as some awesome case studies of how algorithms have been used. Additionally, the class doesn't go into the math behind machine learning algorithms, which I think is really important if we want to be applying them in this class. The psets can be tedious, and it feels like we're just playing around with Python pacakges until things work. I'd love to see a better framework developed for how we should approach difficult problems.</comment>There is nor reason this should be a class. It has zero content.</comment>It's very broad...I learned about lots of topics, but I'm not sure how to apply them to many other types of problems.</comment>I was really interested in data science when I took the class and wanted to learn some python, so in that since the class was useful, but goodness gracious the organization of this class was poor. Problem sets were all over the place and completely disregarding lectures to spend time swimming through the mess that was a problem set was definitely the way to go. For scientists, the instructors (or whoever wrote the problem sets) just had no grasp of what it meant to have clear instructions. They had their conception of what the answer should look like but did a very poor job of guiding us toward that with the framing of the question and examples. On Piazzas, TFs frequently sounded clueless despite their best efforts and that was discouraging. Take the class only if you really are interested in the material since the pain is not worth it otherwise.</comment>Prefer forming teams with other non-extension students.</comment>It's always difficult to teach coding in a classroom. You learn by doing, and you have to make a lot of time for it. The assignments take forever -- the wording is confusing and there are lots of different ways to interpret the questions. The final project is a pain, especially the documentation part. It's all about having something presentable and pretty at the end and yet we don't receive any useful or helpful feedback.</comment>All the lectures were done as powerpoints and hard to pay attention to. The first four problem sets were quite confusing, especially the fourth. The amount of confusion and questions on Piazza speaks to that fact. I didn't really get as much as I wanted out of this course.</comment></course>PHYSICS 145: Elementary Particle Physics</title>This is one of those classes where you may come out feeling like you know less than before, because it exposes you to all of these higher level topics but doesn't go into depth; however, I think it's definitely worth it. The class does pick up in difficulty quite a bit after the first half, and the first few lectures are on history, so it may be difficult to gauge the class appropriately from the first couple weeks. When the more complicated material comes up in the second half, there's also a lot of new and often confusing notation, so it's advisable to make sure you know what the notations mean as soon as they come up, lest you find yourself 5 lectures later not knowing what any of the symbols mean.</comment>It's extraordinarily well-taught and I learned a lot in this course. The course staff are also very good at teaching.</comment>An interesting, not very intense course. Great if you have an interest in particle physics but aren't sure you'll go to grad school to study it formally. It's easy to get a bit lost, since the material is based on things like quantum field theory which you likely have not seen, but no prior experience beyond intro quantum mechanics is necessary. Just try to glean what you can from the many complex equations, even if you don't understand all of them.</comment></course>EXPOS 20.255: The Science of Emotion</title>This class overall provides very interesting material concerning emotion that in general seemed to interest all of the students in the class. The workload for this class is extremely reasonable and the instructor is very helpful with feedback.</comment>Very good expos class if you're interested in neuroscience or any kind of scientific research. Demanding writing standards, but you'll learn a lot.</comment>This is a science course, not a writing course.</comment>It's about neuroscience, not psychology as it may seem. Be prepared to read and write scientific papers. If that's up your alley, it's a very interesting class and you will gain great experience.</comment>This class made me a much better writer. There isn't too much reading, and I found the material interesting. I recommend this class.</comment>Really interesting subject matter. Really helpful and nice teacher. Very good way to improve your writing.</comment>This course is not very heavy on the actual science of emotions, but rather, simply introduces theories of what emotions are (often in a non-scientific context).</comment>Whoever is interested in learning more about emotions, this is a great class!</comment>The best part of this course is the fact that Prof. Tierney actually does cognitive neuroscience. This means that she'll be able to answer questions about the science involved as well as the writing, and it means you learn more.</comment>Just get through it and don't expect more than a B+. Enjoy the material for what it is and do your best to ignore the red tape that pervades the realm of expos so that you can actually get something from this class. Also, go to office hours! It will help a lot more than you think in terms of clarifying your argument.</comment>This course will do a great job of teaching you how to approach and implement analytical writing. The style is very specific to the the sciences, but many of the techniques are widely applicable. The preceptor gives great feedback, and the course material is very interesting.</comment>Very interesting and challenging topics that sometime become philosophical; very helpful for potential science students, especially psychology students. The only problem is that sometimes I feel we spent too much time analyzing the reading materials that we don't have enough exercises on actual writing. There's one class where we analyze an academic essay and discuss how it can improved. I would like more exercises like that</comment></course>EASTD 140: Major Religious Texts of East Asia</title>i took this class as an elective after shopping it during my freshman year, and am so grateful that i found it on the course catalog a year and a half ago. it is truly one of the most engaging, well-conceptualized, and "feel-good" classes i've ever had the privilege to take. professor abe is an incredibly brilliant teacher who is even more humble and approachable, and he truly makes an effort to get to know you through your analysis of the readings and discussion of your thoughts and personal goals. i enjoyed the intimate format of the seminar, and will look for similarly-structured courses in the future (though finding a course just as fantastic as this one will certainly be difficult, if not impossible)!</comment>This course is a wonderful change of pace from usual Harvard courses. The texts you read are fascinating and may make you want to live your life differently. Professor Abe is probably the most accessible and kindest professors that I've worked with here, and he has incredible wisdom to share with the class. Take it if you have any interest in East Asian religions or you want to think critically about how you live.</comment>This class is an absolute gem! Professor Abe crafts an intellectually rewarding experience for each of his students.</comment>Professor Abe is amazing; this course is transformative. It'll challenge the way you think, and stimulate you to ponder about the way you live your life.</comment>I would strongly encourage anyone with any interest in the subject matter (or hoping just to learn a little bit) to take this course. The books are presented in a way that really makes you think about their meaning through great class discussion. The small class size also leads to everyone getting to talk plenty, and you don't feel pressured to speak or not speak in the class. Professor Abe is the nicest professor, and he really cares both about his students and about what he's talking about. He's passionate, and you can't help feel passionate about the subject matter as well. Reading fiction at the end of the course was also a great change from previous courses I've took, and not having to analyze it like an English text and instead reading it for the impact it has on you personally causes you to realize that you can derive plenty of knowledge, whether academic, intellectual, or personal, when you actually enjoy a book rather than just study it. I applaud Professor Abe for helping me re-realize this.</comment>I took this class because I heard great things about it, and I was excited to discover classes that I would remember for the rest of my life. I also wanted to dedicate time during the week to relax and read books that I was interested in. This class took a few weeks for me to really settle into, but by the end, I was amazed at how thoughtful and interesting our conversations were. I am so glad to have gotten to know Professor Abe and to have learned more about Taoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism and much much more of course.</comment>best class at Harvard.</comment>I really hope Prof. Abe teaches this course again! I'm not a humanities person and definitely not EAS, but this course was well worth the novel-a-week reading schedule. You also learn a lot about yourself in the process, and get to reflect on that in a final project of your choosing. A high quality gem that shouldn't be missed.</comment></course>BCS Cr: Advanced Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian</title>This course was fantastic. I previously had limited exposure to ex-Yugoslav writers, so I was unsure as to how difficult this class would be. Professor Vidan was able to ease us into the literature, and always structured the class to fit what we were most interested in. I was able to work on both my reading comprehension and writing skills throughout the semester, and would take the class again in a heartbeat.</comment>If you want to improve your BCS skills, I highly recommend this class.</comment>This class is what you make it -- if your class is motivated and interesting and you push yourselves, you will get a lot out of it. Professor Vidan is a fantastic (and, to my mind, underused) resource.</comment></course>E-PSCI 181: Historical Geobiology</title>Professor Knoll is an amazing individual and I am happy to have had the chance to take a class with him! Fun and unique class that was very self-guided and helped me grow as a learner. Take it if the topic of geobiology is something you are interested in.</comment>This is probably the best class I have taken at Harvard. We read really interesting papers on issues at the forefront of modern research, and then have fantastic discussions in class every day. The grad students and postdocs who sit in offer an enormous knowledge base in all sorts of areas.</comment>This seminar-style class is quite interesting. Be comfortable volunteering to present, speaking for 15 minutes every other week, and speaking with the other students and Prof Knoll. However, the expectations were not as clear as I had hoped, so it was difficult to gauge my status throughout the semester.</comment>Really great class. Prof. Knoll is really knowledgeable and approachable. Really great for understanding how biology and geology interact.</comment></course>VIETNAM Ba: Elementary Vietnamese</title>Be prepared for a great but challenging class for learning a useful language. This class is definitely not the easiest, but the professor really cares about help you understand the language deeply from a linguistics point of view. You will learn how to pronounce complicated Vietnamese sounds as well as make useful phrases and sentences. However, be prepared for quite some work and the 9AM trek every day. Also, I don't recommend taking this class as a 5th class.</comment>Take this course if you are strongly interested in learning vietanmese language and its culture. But do know that it is not an easy class, you probably need to spend around 7-8 hours a week for this course and the class time might be quite demanding. Also, the classroom environment can be quite different from other classes.</comment></course>PHYSICS 271: Topics in the Physics of Quantum Information</title>Homework is fairly balanced and you actually learn a lot from the presentations.</comment>Excellent introduction to quantum information, lectures are engaging, and presentations and psets provide a good overview of modern theory and experiment in the field</comment>The course will introduce you to current research in quantum information.</comment>A great course if you are interested in quantum information with a focus on experiments. Don't expect much quantum information theory though.</comment>If you are interested in learning current research topics in quantum information science, this course will provide you a large number of fruitful materials that can interest you very much. Personally, I would say this course seems to be more concentrated on atomic physics perspective.</comment></course>SOCIOL 24: Introduction to Social Inequality</title>This course deals with incredibly interesting and important topics, but I have reservations recommending it. First, you will learn less about inequality and more about how a sociologist would approach studying sociology, as the course is very method-focused. Second, Jason is a lovely man but a horrible teacher -- he has no ability to organize discussion or even explain simple sociological concepts without abstract diagrams that only serve to further muddle the information. However, Katherine (the TF) is absolutely god-sent, and section functions like lecture as she works to clarify everything that was confused during class.</comment>This course is wonderful! Great way to explore sociology. Really interesting and important topic.</comment>This class will make you fall in love with sociology. The readings, if nothing else, will make you a smarter person by the end of the semester and I promise that.</comment>Great readings, great professor/TF, great intro into the field of sociology</comment>I'm not sure it's necessary to take the class -- maybe just recommend the reading list to my friend.</comment>The readings were interesting. However, I just don't think a class size of 35 works that great for a seminar. Discussion is often quite redundant and not very perplexing.</comment>35 people is too many people for a discussion based course. Jason should lecture more, since he's good at it, and ask fewer people to talk in class, since all that turns into is people saying fun facts they learned in the books so that they can get participation credit. Katherine is awesome. Very interesting material overall, but would like to learn more in the class itself</comment>Enjoyed this class! It's a lot of little work every week, but that really keeps you on top of the reading. You have to read a book like every week, so be prepared to learn how to skim books strategically (but they, for the most part, are fun reads). The tests are pretty straight forward. Really great class that is a great intro into Sociology.</comment>This class was really eyeopening. You can easily do well in the class and get a lot out of it without a significant background in sociology.</comment>This class is a wonderful introductory class.  It exposes you to fascinating topics in a very accessible way.  The discussions we had were always lively and thought-provoking.  Overall, it is not too demanding of a class, so it is a great class to use to balance out your schedule.  Furthermore, Professor Beckfield is tremendously enthusiastic and knowledgable, and clearly is eager to make us love the material.</comment>I think I had very high expectations given the current social climate, and I think that there is room for growth because the class is good, but I don't want Beckfield to become complacent.</comment>Only take this course if you are looking for an INTRODUCTION to social inequality. The course was interesting but just covered the bare surface of the most pressing issues. There was also a lack of discussion or focus on how to change things--then again, it is a sociology class. If you are considering majoring in sociology, I would recommend it. If you are interested in changing inequities, don't bother.</comment>This class will open your eyes to issues you have never thought about. The books and materials are some of the most interesting I've ever had for a class so the somewhat large amounts of reading are actually quite manageable. Class is really interesting and if you do the reading and participate, preparing for all of the tests will be really manageable.</comment>This class is great and I highly recommend taking it. It covers societal inequality in two large areas -- race and gender -- but the ideas you learn here can be applied almost anywhere. It also gives you a much sounder understanding of American history, society and public policies.</comment>This is a solid course. You'll learn a good bit about why certain aspects of social inequality exist (especially pertaining to class, race, and gender). It's also a very easy course. However, many of the concepts are fairly obvious. If you need a sociology requirement for pre-med, this is it. If you have some experience with social theory or social studies at all, you may want to take a more advanced class.</comment>This class was very interesting and I would definitely recommend it to someone interested in social issues in general. One of my more enjoyable classes this semester by far. The reading was a lot at times, but it was interesting and beneficial.</comment>Wonderful course that gives you a broad breadth and depth of knowledge on different types of social inequality! Super interesting material that makes you much more conscious and aware of the world around you. Also, make sure you do the reading!!! And try to participate in discussion - you get that much more out of it!</comment>Only take this course if you are ready to confront your privilege, especially if you are a white, heterosexual, cysgender, upper-cass male. I also think it is important to emphasize that this is really what the title suggests--an introduction. Hence, do not expect to have the most in-depth conversations you have ever had.</comment>It's a sociology class expect it to be liberal.</comment>There is a LOT of reading in this class, but it's engaging material and not difficult to do well in the class.</comment></course>VES 153br: Intermediate Animation Workshop</title>If you have not taken an animation course before, take the intro animation course first. This course jumps right into animation, and there is much more individual working time than there is actual learning / hand-holding.</comment>Animation is, as always, what you make of it. Ruth and Dan are incredible instructors who will go above and beyond to help you achieve what you want to. It is a ton of work outside of class.</comment>Ruth is a great teacher, animation is cruelly addictive. It will suck hours out of your week but you will enjoy the time spent, until a point, at which point you want to throw your computer out the window. Regardless, it was great to be able to block off some time to explore a new medium of art. Recommend if you like drawing and video classes and want to try an intersection of the two!</comment>It's cooler/better if you have a project in mind that you want to hash out!</comment>Animation is time consuming but really rewarding!!</comment></course>PSY 1652r: Laboratory in Early Cognitive Development</title>It's a really interesting class especially if you get an incoming postdoc or a new experiment as you get to help shape it and put your input</comment></course>PHIL 175f: Justice and the Family: Proseminar</title>Make sure you find the material engaging</comment>If you are looking for the rigor of a philosophy course and the practical relevance of a sociology or public policy seminar, this is the class for you. Professor Shelby is not only brilliant and a gifted discussion leader, but is also one of the only philosophy professors at Harvard doing work that has real impact on human lives. A clarification: this course doesn't ask, "How should we parent?" It asks questions like, "WHY do parents have obligations to their children?" I was super interested in the latter kind of question. If you are, too, then I highly recommend that you take this class.</comment>The family is a neglected topic within philosophy, which made this class both refreshing and frustrating. It was intellectually rewarding to consider issues related to the family from the perspective of justice, though I could not help but be reminded of the limitations of the approaches we examined in adequately addressing many of the issues we looked at.</comment>Professor Shelby is wonderful and asks really interesting questions. The family is a topic underexplored by philosophers and I'm really happy to have taken a class on it.</comment>The topics were very interesting, issues that I hadn't really thought much about before. Seminar discussion overall was engaging and directed well, although some weeks were dull. I would have liked to have gotten more feedback, though.</comment></course>PSY 2661r: Research Seminar in Nonverbal Behavior, Social Perception, and Psychophysiology</title>This a great opportunity to get a sense of what behavioral psychology research looks like, especially at the business school. Amy Cuddy is a rockstar in her field and you get to interact with her and all the other interesting lab members at lab meetings, and there are various projects to get involved in. Keep in mind, however, that because Amy is such a powerhouse and is so busy, you probably won't get too much personal mentorship if that's what you're looking for.</comment>There was a lot of reshuffling happening this semester so I didn't do too much and did not have too much contact with Professor Cuddy. However the lab manager that I worked with was excellent and cared a lot. When I did have to do things they were interesting and engaging.</comment></course>SPANSH 171: Barcelona and the Catalan Culture</title>Take this class if you have ever traveled to Spain, or would want to in the future. Eloi is the best, and he really wants you to get as much as you can out of discussions. Barcelona is one of the most amazing cities in the world, and this course grounds the myths and touristy aspects in their historical context. The class is flexible to all levels of Spanish speakers, but it can definitely be difficult to contribute if you don't feel comfortable speaking in the language. Take this class!</comment>Eloi is fabulous and the material is super interesting--definitely worth taking.</comment>I loved this class. Eloi is a great teacher - personable and thoughtful. He really engages his students and checks in with each individual to make sure he or she is getting as much out of the class as possible. The course combines the academic study of art, architecture, history, language, urban design, and more -- great for any lover of the humanities.</comment>It was really awesome, but the readings were not all in Spanish, so it was less of a challenge in that way.</comment>Fun, edifying class with a knowledgeable and committed instructor. Not too academically demanding, as long as you keep on top of the (very reasonable) readings.</comment>This is a very fun and useful class that explores the history of Barcelona into the contemporary moment. Eloi is a wonderful professor, who gets students excited about the subject material.  Assignments are usually able to fit with your interests since the course is very broad- covering art, architecture, literature, and beyond. A great, great class! Highly recommend.</comment>Fantastic course about Barcelona and Catalan culture! Hard to find Spanish courses that focus on Spain specifically, and on city as beautiful as Barcelona. You definitely have to do the readings because the entire course was based on 1.5-hour long discussions twice a week on them. Response papers weren't too demanding, and neither were the midterm, final, and final paper. Eloi is great discussion leader and it was a very fun course!</comment></course>SWEDISH Ba: Intermediate Swedish: Childhood in Swedish Literature and Culture</title>Maja's wonderful, she's very helpful and a small class is a great opportunity to get in a lot of speaking time!</comment></course>AFRAMER 118: The History of African Americans From the Slave Trade to the Civil War</title>Take this class!</comment>This class is great if you know what you're getting yourself into. Vince is a lot of fun, really creative, and really cool, but he also can be tough to engage because of how smart he is. The material is challenging and disturbing, so while the grading might not be that tough, you will be challenged intellectually and personally. In other words, don't just take it on a whim. Take it if you know you're interested in the material.</comment>This is the perfect class if you have no background in African American studies. It's essential history taught in a thoughtful way.</comment>Take it because it is only going to get better and it is already great. Professor Brown is a fantastic professor and really cares about the material. Not that difficult a class, but engaging and challenging material conceptually.</comment>Do the reading--it is worth it. We read seminal works that are important if you want to be a scholar of this area of history</comment>This class will ground you very firmly in the historiography of the African American experience before the Civil War, with lectures serving as the primary basis for historical knowledge. Though his scripted lectures may seem rather dense, Professor Brown's patient, comical, and very attentive moderation of discussions makes every student's contribution valuable and worthy of further examination. The number and nature of the assignments seem fair and straightforward, although it seeks to synthesize a great number of sources for argumentative purposes. So make sure to do all the readings because it will be very important when it comes to writing the essays.</comment>This class is such a gem. Professor Brown is incredibly brilliant, and my one complaint is that he doesn't speak for the entirety of the class.</comment>Professor Brown is an amazing lecturer, and the material is extremely engaging. Take the class.</comment>do not miss this chance to take a class with professor Brown. He is incredibly inspiring, insightful, imaginative and both his lectures and his discussion-facilitation are awesome. they have a couple kinks to work out since it was his first year teaching it (such as defining the papers more specifically), but I would highly highly recommend this class.</comment>Great class. Great professor and TF's. There is a fairly heavy amount of reading but the readings were very interesting and I wanted to do the reading each week so it didn't really seem like I was doing that much work at all because I enjoyed it.</comment></course>FRSEMR 35n: The Art and Craft of Acting</title>Even if you have absurdly high expectations for this course, your expectations will be exceeded. Be prepared to see terrific shows all over Boston, form a wonderfully close ensemble with your peers, and love every moment you spend learning from the incomparable Remo Airaldi.</comment>It's fantastic, and if you have the chance to do it, take it.</comment>Remo had a way of creating a close, tight-knit group of passionate individuals. He is an absolutely phenomenal teacher and mentor. I value the other actors in this class so much and am so glad that I was able to meet them and interact with them in such a wonderful, fun, and lively class. I am going to miss this class more than anything. It was one of the most incredible classes I've ever taken. Remo is also such an incredible director--when we worked on our monologues his feedback was better than that of many directors I've worked with. TAKE THIS COURSE!</comment>This will be the best course you take freshman fall. Prepare, and come with an open mind and heart!</comment>TAKE IT. This is one of the best courses offered here at Harvard. REMO's dedication to this course and its students is unparalleled. This seminar is difficult to get into, so if you can't do this, make sure you take another acting class with him. He truly is amazing.</comment>I could go on for pages about this class but I will keep it short.  Remo is the greatest person you will ever come into contact with and this is possibly the greatest class at Harvard.  You will leave this class a completely different actor than when you began (in the most fantastic way possible).</comment>I would tell them that it is an awesome environment to work in and learn from, and that the two hours I spent in that room on Mondays were such a relief and fun break from the rest of Harvard.</comment>If you are at all interested in acting, take this class. Remo is an incredible teacher, and getting the chance to work with him in this setting is a chance that you should not miss.</comment>Take this class if you are interested in acting and, more importantly, in people. You will become amazing friends with the others in this class through the beautifully crafted assignments and the goodness of Remo's heart - he creates such a pleasant environment in class, it is impossible to be unhappy. The class is, of course, hard to get into. So apply. It will make your freshman year. Bonus: networking with other theater kids, reading Hagen's book (fairly helpful), and one-on-one monologue work with a theatrical deity (Remo).</comment>This is literally the best class you will ever take in college.  It is amazing in every way - Remo is incredible as a teacher and human, you make amazing friends, you push yourself but in the most fun way, and you get to spend class and homework time making art and getting to know yourself and your peers like no other class allows you to.</comment>I quite honestly cannot imagine any of my future classes at Harvard being as fun or interesting as this class. I loved that I actually learned about acting but in an environment full of games and outings to see performances.</comment>TAKE THIS CLASS. This was the best class I've ever taken.</comment></course>LING 225a: Introduction to Hittite</title>Any aspiring Indo-Europeanist must be exposed to Hittite, and Prof. Rau's way of doing that is actually quite effective, as long as you do all the required exercises.</comment>A good introduction to a fascinating and important language. Be prepared to work hard--the course moves very quickly.</comment>Very interesting class and Professor Rau is a great teacher who has deep knowledge of Hittite and Indo-European. Be prepared to spend a lot of time on the homework and translation and studying for the midterm and final.</comment></course>APPHY 225: Introduction to Soft Matter</title>You learn how much you put in.</comment>This class lacked cohesion, there was no clear story or goals. Lectures were a hodgepodge of topics, often unrelated, with no motivation. Often equations were written on the board without defining several of the key variables. Other times, basic equations were talked about at length without offering any new physical insights. More relevant to the course as a whole, expectations for final projects and assignments were NOT clear. Until the drop deadline, we were told that the final project would be individual. After the drop deadline, the professors told us we would have to do group final projects. This made it very difficult to pick a topic that was interesting to everyone.</comment>If you want a broad overview of many topics, then this is a good class to take. However, it doesn't go into depth on any one topic. There was also a huge emphasis on physics and statistical mechanics which isn't applicable to most people's research interests. I wish that more of a conceptual understanding of the topics was given rather than mathematical.</comment>The course gives a good overview of topics in soft materials and points out groups at Harvard working in the field. The topics and homework is well accessible, but the course is not designed to focus on specific subjects.</comment>It is good to take this course if you want to get a general idea of soft matter physics. But not good for learning things in proper details.</comment>There is good exposure to many topics, but the treatment of any one is not at all comprehensive. A good introduction to physical concepts, but don't expect to get anything terribly practical out of it. The project is a good chance to try something more experimental and was somewhat helpful in solidifying concepts.</comment>Great overview of topics in physics related to soft matter. Good for any SEAS G1 student.</comment></course>STAT 303hf: The Art and Practice of Teaching Statistics</title>Very helpful teaching experience</comment></course>OEB 145: Genes and Behavior</title>Great class that really introduces you to the genetic component of many common behaviors without being overbearing.</comment>Section was always really fun. The material of the course was really interesting which made discussion in section as or even more interesting. I enjoyed the class!</comment>This class was very laid back in terms of structure, but I still learned a lot about behavioral genetics. During the first month of the course, we focused on the popular methods used in genetics research. We then had two weeks off to work on our midterm, which was a review paper on a topic of our choice. The rest of the course talked about really interesting topics, including the genetics of sleep, love/trust, and language. Professor Zhang is extremely knowledgeable about the literature, gives great lectures, and is always happy to answer questions. The final was also extremely fair (and open-book/notes).</comment>In theory, this should be an interesting introductory class to big topics in behavioral genetics research, whose small setting should give room for discussion. I was excited to join a class with a very knowledgeable professor who was very willing to help. However, it turned out that many people in the class already had an extensive background in the field of genetics, so much of the knowledge was assumed to be known by everybody, so the class ended up not feeling introductory at all. Since many people already knew about these topics, they didn't seem very interested in engaging in class discussion (many of them just took it because it was an easy class for them). This made the class less fun than it could otherwise have been.  That said, the topics (including sleep, social behavior, love) are very interesting! Kind of wished there was a greater emphasis on the different methods used in genetic research and what kind of questions each of them can answer.</comment>This is a fantastic course and it will change how you think about research. I learned many research techniques and the class sparked my interest in doing genetics research. The midterm review was a tremendous learning opportunity and one of the most enriching assignment at Harvard thus far.</comment>This class is very low workload (probably the least amount of time I've ever put into a biology class at Harvard). However, I wasn't particularly impressed with Professor Zhang's lectures, especially since it was often hard to understand her accent. The course material is certainly interesting, but it was often hard to understand the rather eclectic lectures.</comment>This class is something of a hidden gem in the OEB department. It's surprisingly chill - only a 90 minute lecture, and a paper discussion section per week - but you get a lot more out of it than you'd think if you come prepared with questions and do the reading (it's literally 3-5 pages and some background material).</comment>This was the most unorganized course I have taken in my 4 years at Harvard.  There was no communication between the professor and the students, nor were the professor and TF on the same page.  Communication regarding the midterm essay and final exam was nonexistent, making it extremely difficult to understand what was expected of the students.  The professor hardly came to class, giving about 8-10 lectures over the course of the entire semester and not even coming to the Wednesday class meetings.  Lectures rarely even filled up the 90 minute time slot.  The course was not up to the standards of the Harvard life sciences in term of providing a fulfilling educational experience.  Overall this was a very disappointing experience, especially compared to my across-the-board positive experiences in the life sciences at Harvard.  With that said, course work is negligible and it served its purpose for me of being an easy 4th class.</comment></course>ENG-SCI 246: Plasticity</title>Best Professor I have ever had. Really enthusiastic and knowledgeable.</comment>This class, including the materials, assignments, and everything, is a very difficult. However, Professor Suo is a great lecturer, and I would highly recommend that anyone considering taking this class should definitely take it. You will learn a lot from this course, and professor does a great job of giving a comprehensive view as opposed to just looking at plasticity.</comment>It is a very fun course! Professor teaches in a very simple and enlightening way by illustrating many interesting examples, not only lengthy calculations. I think you can learn a lot about plasticity as well as topics in rheology in this class.</comment></course>HIST 1877: History of Middle East, 600-1055</title>A little dense but an important class if you want to understand Islam.</comment>This course does not require previous knowledge of middle eastern history, but previous knowledge is extremely important. The course is taught primarily at a graduate level and due to the familiarity of graduate students with the material, it seems that undergraduates must simultaneously tackle both the depth and breadth of the subject matter to maintain equal footing.</comment>Was lost frequently because the class would break off on tangents concerning Islamic scholarship we had no knowledge of. It was clear from very early on that this was not going to be a visual learning class, there are no lecture slides, but the professor is so knowledgable that his lectures are okay without them it just could be so much better. Han Hsien is so fantastic however and a great TF.</comment>If you're looking for a comprehensive overview of early Middle Eastern history, then this course is for you. The readings are very interesting and not too overwhelming, and so are Prof. Mottahedeh's lectures. Section is incredible!</comment>It was not a typical introductory course, I often found myself lost amidst the in depth political history and questions by the various grad students in the class. It is very interesting, but undergraduates should know this it is rather advanced and contains a lot of graduate students.</comment></course>MUSIC 16hfr: Radcliffe Choral Society</title>RCS is great. If you have even the inkling of an urge to audition, do it! Beth is amazing (though she'll be leaving next year, but I'm sure whoever replaces her will be amazing too!), the group is amazing, and the music is beautiful.</comment>This is just like being in RCS, but you get credit for it! Rehearsals take 5 hours a week, and the music and people are fun. Beth is a great conductor.</comment>Take RCS for credit! The chorus is amazing and gets to sing a variety of repertoire, the conductors are nice and expect a lot of you, and the organization is almost completely student run, and gives lots of opportunities for members to get involved and have a say in decisions. There is very little difference between taking RCS for or without credit, so long as one remembers to go to rehearsal.   Before I joined RCS, I had played classical violin for 12 years and had never sung before. This chorus is open not only to people with prior singing experience, but also to people who are willing to learn how to sing and who are interested in choral music. Because it is a women's chorus, the repertoire sung here is very different from the music sung in co ed and men's choirs, and is both musically and historically interesting.</comment>I love RCS so much. It's not only a class, but a choral community and a sisterhood. <3</comment>It takes more time than you think and it has to be a priority if you take it as a class.</comment>RCS is far more than a class. It is a choir and a sisterhood.</comment>RCS as a class is wonderful and as long as you don't have major attendance issues, is pretty much the same as doing it as an extracurricular.</comment>RCS has been one of the best things that has happened to me at Harvard. Not only is it incredibly rewarding to have the opportunity to work with such an amazingly talented group of women (and men when we collaborate with Glee Club and COllegium), but RCS provides you with a home on campus.</comment>Singing in RCS is such a community experience! I have bonded with amazing girls, gained confidence in myself, and learned that even groups work together with other groups (RCS sings with Glee Club).</comment>RCS IS BY FAR the best experience I've had at Harvard <3</comment></course>SOCIOL 203a: Advanced Quantitative Research Methods</title>read the lecture notes before class!</comment>The lecture notes are fabulous. Read them twice.</comment>You will come out of this class really understanding what goes on under the hood when you analyze data (where lots of other classes allow you to get through without having that deep understanding). But you have to be ready to spend a lot of time on this class, including both in-class learning and homework/studying. I would think of it as 2 classes, not 1.</comment>An applied quantitative social sciences class that gets beginners to become intermediate practitioners.</comment>good overview for someone with basic stats background</comment>It is a lot of work but very rewarding.</comment>Very hard, but very rewarding. A must for social scientists.</comment>It is a tough course. Be prepared to spend a lot of time on the course, between class, section and the problem sets, it adds up. I would recommend finding a few people to study with. You will learn a lot.</comment>This is an absolutely necessary course for quantitative researchers. But for others it is likely to be a challenge.</comment></course>IRISH 132: Introduction to Modern Irish</title>This may vary from person to person, but for me the language didn't really start to "click" until about halfway through the course, so it can be a bit of a struggle to get started. Once it did, though, it was incredibly rewarding and I strongly recommend anyone with even a passing interest in Irish to take this class.</comment>This course is well taught and gives you a solid base in the Irish language. It also mixes in lessons about Irish culture.</comment>Irish may not be the most practical language, but it's fun to learn. I'm going to continue taking the language. Also, Kathryn is a really good teacher.</comment></course>ENGLISH 233: Trans-Reformation English Writing: Graduate Seminar</title>The reading list is not trifling, but on the other hand, the sheer breadth of texts you will cover makes the course worth it (if you put the time in!).</comment>This course provides something which many, within the world of post-secondary education, do not: a space in which nascent propositions and debate are encouraged, while retaining a professional and respectful atmosphere.</comment>This is a course bridging medieval and renaissance literature (and, in fact, challenging our periodized definitions of them)-- so if your interests lie anywhere in those areas, definitely take the class! If they don't, it's a particularly unusual and interesting way to approach 14th-17th century literature, and therefore well worth taking. Paper-writing is taken seriously, and the weekly responses are a good opportunity to develop preliminary ideas for longer essays. Also, while the syllabus seems kaleidoscopic in itself, it's well worth it to explore other resources, especially EEBO -- I found materials very closely related to the course reading there.</comment>This class was, unfortunately, a disappointment. For those looking to get coverage for Generals, this course is not the best way to go about it. Simply put, you will find the class more concerned with religious and political history than literature itself -- there is almost no discussion whatsoever of form, style, genre, poetics, translation, literary history, or the history of the English language. As such, those without any previous exposure to writing of the late medieval and early modern periods will be left to fill in the blanks. Moreover, too many texts are assigned each week -- in some cases, up to five separate primary sources, only one or two of which will be covered in a two-hour session. This can be frustrating, not only because students will all choose to read different subsets of assigned texts each week, but also because discussion might skim over important sources (e.g. spending half an hour on Hamlet). This course was also missing two key ingredients that other grad seminars in the department offer: first, a review of relevant/contemporary scholarship as an introduction to debates within the field (alongside primary texts); and second, some aspect of professionalization in written assignments. Weekly scholarly 'paratexts' are assigned, but not stressed in discussion at all. And the writing assignments -- two papers and weekly responses -- are not tailored to either conference paper or journal article formats. That said, Professor Simpson is wonderful and knows everything there is to know about the material. I just worry that the structure of the course is wanting.</comment></course>VES 71: Silent Cinema</title>It is a great class if you want to expand your artistic palate.</comment>Really worth taking. The material is awesome and the prints that they screen are gorgeous. Even if you're not thinking about doing anything VES in the future this is a great survey course of early film that isn't too demanding.</comment>Interesting readings that you should read if you really are concerned about learning the topic. Not very demanding course work. Assignments are graded more harshly than you would expect, but it's for the benefit of becoming a better writer.</comment>This course is great, you watch a lot of films and get a great understanding of the emergence of cinema. Professor Hart is very approachable and enthusiastic about the material</comment>In my opinion, students with no film background whatsoever should definitely pause before taking this class. It is not a history course, or a class on the storylines of the films we watch. If you want to study the history of cinema, then this class is not for you. If you want to study narratives in film, similar to how in a literature course you may write papers on storylines in novels, this class is not the class for you. I went into this class with false perceptions of what we were actually going to be studying, which is partly my fault for misunderstanding the syllabus. Read the fine print. Speak to students who have taken the class before. Don't go into this thinking you will solely be talking about the history of film.  If you have an analytical, logical mind, then this class may come more easily to you. For a lot of this course you need to deconstruct scenes and frames into sums of parts (i.e. set, lighting, techniques) and analyze them with critical thinking skills. You will write blog posts on things like the use of tracking shots and/or shot-reverse-shots within films and not only what they signify/how they work within the narrative, but you must make arguments about your observations and back them up. This was a very confusing way of thinking and viewing film for me; don't fall into the trap of getting caught up in the movie itself/the narrative, or simply writing about topics, not arguments. Also be sure not to swing the pendulum too far in the other direction and be too dry. I had a very difficult time finding a balance between the two and understanding this way of thinking. It's almost as if the course is so analytical, it becomes almost too abstract.   That being said, if you show up (on time-cannot stress this enough) to class and turn in your work, you will be fine. Adam is passionate about the material and is committed to helping his students succeed. If you have trouble, he is more than willing to help you understand the readings/lectures.  Overall, even though I had a very difficult time grasping the material at times, I do not regret taking this course. I got to see a lot of amazing, groundbreaking films that I otherwise would have never had access to. It was a new academic challenge for me and a completely different way of thinking and analyzing. My one regret is that, not that I took this class, but that I took this class during a semester when I had a very time consuming, stressful courseload to where I could not fully focus like I would have liked to on this class. Then again, every student is different, but if you suspect that this class if going to be difficult for you, take your other classes into account before committing.  Lastly, I adored the weeks where we watched comedic classics like Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, as well as the Lumiere brothers and whimsical Melies. I will be honest though, watching avant garde films (google Anemic Cinema and Emak Bakia to get a feel for the genre) was painful, because it was extremely abstract for me to understand.</comment>This course will give you a solid foundation not only in film history but also in theory to some extent. Professor Hart is delightful as are all of these films.</comment>This class was a great introduction to the world of film. It dealt with various theorists and practitioners answers to the question "What is cinema?" which in turn taught me a lot about all the things that can be achieved with a camera. All the films we watched were great, and I did learn a lot about formal analysis of film, but it almost seemed like the teachers expected us to come in already somewhat familiar with it. I will say that the grading was harsh and discussions were not the best (although I'm not sure how much of that was a lack of interest on the students' part or the fault of the teachers).</comment></course>NEUROBIO 101hfi: The Neurobiology of Drug Addiction</title>Its interesting and Johanna is great at teaching! If you're passionate about research and drugs, its definitely for you. I'm not that passionate about research, so sometimes reading the scientific papers is annoying. Writing a grant proposal definitely is a challenge, especially for me because I'm not research oriented. With that said, its a good class and I'm happy I'm in it.</comment>Johanna is just wonderful. She really knows the material, is supportive and helpful and kind, eager to connect and engage with the class. The papers are all interesting. Expectations are always laid out and are absolutely reasonable. I recommend with enthusiasm!</comment>Great class! Johanna is awesome, the material is really interesting, and you learn a lot without ever begin stressed by the amount of material.</comment>This is a great class. Johanna is fantastic. One of those classes you enjoy going to and thinking about.</comment></course>ETH-REASON 30: The Just World</title>Keep up with the readings; they're very interesting. Engage in section.</comment>If you are interested in engaging in some serious thinking, contemplation, and writing, this is a fantastic course. You will be pressed to think critically about some serious issues facing our world today and the best courses of action to respond to them.</comment>Do not take this course!! The upside of this course: it is extremely easy and you will do well with very minimal effort (never doing the reading or going to class). That said, you will also not get anything out of this course. This course is by far the worst that I have taken since getting to Harvard -- Risse is an awful lecturer and the class is terribly organized. I'm sure there are tons of easy classes at Harvard you can take and at least get something useful out of -- seriously, this class is a waste of your time.</comment>Though it is a tough class in terms of constructing arguments and understanding the exact arguments many of the authors make, you come out knowing a good deal on how to accurately and moreover systematically reason.</comment>As a science major I would recommend this course to everyone. The readings are interesting and very easy to understand. This course was interesting and inspiring to me.</comment>The class overall was okay. Pretty straightforward, not that hard, the papers were fine. The topics in the second half of the course were interesting, but the first bit is pretty dry. I would recommend this class to people who are really interested in philosophically thinking about global issues. For me personally, given that we only get to take a limited number of courses at Harvard, I kind of wish I shopped something else.</comment>Professor Risse is a phenomenal lecturer. He's surprisingly funny and very engaging. Moreover, I thought the chosen readings and topics were really accessible given that I had no prior background in philosophy--they were thoughtful, complementary, and actually really educational. Probably the best ethical reasoning Gen Ed that I've heard of!</comment>great intro to ethical reasoning</comment>You will get what you put into this course. I put in very little and got very little out. The nice thing is that the Final is super easy and so are all of the assignments. You can get through the whole class without doing a single reading (outside of the 3 that directly relate to papers). Sections can get interesting, so that is good.</comment>This is an excellent gen-ed with engaging sections, and not too heavy of a workload, yet that still makes you think about important ethical and global issues. Good for people who may not be wholly interested in philosophy. You will get out of it what you put in, in the sense that most readings aren't necessary if you take good notes and pay attention in lecture and engage in section.</comment>A lot of reading</comment>It covers interesting topics, the Professor sometimes is difficult to understand and having a good TF is really important, otherwise you'll struggle so much with your papers!</comment>Three papers, not very long, not too difficult final exam where he gives you the questions before-hand. Section was a little dry and sometimes got confusing though. I would go in thinking I understood the readings and leave section confused.</comment>If you are looking to take ER30 for a GenEd, simply do not.  Poorly run class.  Prof Risse was a good guy, but the class was a bust.</comment>Students may find that this course takes too academic an approach to social issues without giving enough opportunity to really think about how the issues at hand affect people in the world every day.</comment>This class was pretty good! The topics are interesting. But, I think the experience comes down to your TF. Klemen was absolutely great and was very helpful when it came to writing. The professor is very understanding as well. The essays are pretty chill and you don't really need to do the readings to do well in the class. Plus, the final was very simple and was really more about assessing what you got from the class instead of regurgitating information.</comment>This is a great course to take to fulfill your Ethical Reasoning Gen Ed.  Mathias and his TF's are passionate about what they do, but also realize that most of the class is taking the course as a general elective.  As such, the workload is quite manageable.  You grow as a human being by taking this course, feeling better informed about your ethical views.  Additionally, you are challenged to argue your views against some of the smartest people in the world, and you might even change some of them!</comment>This is a very good ER. It is as painless as they go (I'm a CS concentrator and I hate  writing). James, my TF was an awesome guy and Professor Risse is also great. The really just want you to be exposed to the material, it's what a gen ed should be. Definitely take it.</comment>The end result is rewarding because the topics are relevant but the day to day lectures and readings can be dry. The readings aren't entirely necessary to do, but I found it helpful to do the readings that we talked about in class. James is an awesome TF- who is very helpful.</comment>A nice overview of some very important ethical topics. Gets you thinking about real issues. Papers are very easy, but the readings definitely aren't overly simple. Great ER.</comment>I thought the class was well implemented.  The staff was great, and I had a really good section leader.  I just realized that philosophy was not my cup of tea, being a science concentrator who is used to taking rigor into account when making logical arguments.</comment>Professor Risse is a very good lecturer and is very good at tying everything together. The readings and lectures are connected very well which is nice because the reading is dense and difficult to understand. The final exam was very fair and was administered only to make the students review the material.</comment>This class frustrated me to no end. Circular arguments abound and I got nothing out of it. It was really easy and did not require much work of you, which was good for me as i took that time and put it into chem 30. But if you are actually looking to think about ethical dilemmas instead of just coming up with terms and making conclusions that are only useful within a very narrow and unrealistic definition of that term, don't take this course.</comment>This course has great balance between teaching you how to think about moral issues around the world and how to solve some of these issues but also helps with more technical aspects like writing papers fit for these topics. With some interesting paper prompts and course readings throughout this class is thought provoking in a beneficial way.</comment>Its not a huge time commitment, but is still very engaging, interesting, and thought-provoking.</comment>Take it.</comment>Great introductory philosophy course that teaches you how to write effectively.</comment>This class is great, honestly. The professor is good at making the readings (which can be a bit overwhelming) very clear in lecture. All essays and exams were straightforward and dealt with what was discussed in class rather than arcane details from the reading. Though this course is challenging, it's extremely rewarding. I feel like I'm a better global citizen.</comment>Even if you haven't engaged with questions of morality or philosophy before, this class is a great way to get introduced to the field of ethics while examining topics in international relations that are fascinating.</comment>This class is a very good way to satisfy an ER requirement. Professor Risse is quite a good lecturer. The material is straight forward, but interesting. There isn't much room for creative work on short essays that are loaded with sub-questions to answer, but that also makes them relatively painless.</comment>pretty easy. 3 essays and the final, which was very easy if you prepare. if lectures will be made available online (even if it's only during reading & finals period), don't really need to attend lecture</comment>Pretty easy way to fulfill the er requirement. Better than er 18. Would recommend it to anybody, especially if you're vaguely interested in politics or political philosophy.</comment>The essays are tough, make sure you plan them and think them through! The final is not too hard! You become a better writer</comment>A good course that covers lots of interesting material. Risse is an engaging and thoughtful lecturer and welcomes student interaction. Some of the reading is very dry but the workload is light and the 3 papers are not a huge burden. Studying for final has helped me synthesize all the material and its actually quite interesting. A good course.</comment>ER 30 would be a great class if it was concentration-specific, not a Gen. Ed.  I found myself somewhat overwhelmed with the pace at which we went over the material, as well as plagued by the lack of clarity of the essay prompts.  Section was so-so, but essentially it is simply the TF asking a bunch of questions about the reading and the students answering those questions - nothing more.  For a Gen. Ed., don't take this course. But if it is required for a concentration (if it is, I'm unsure), it'd be a good course!</comment>The lectures--and the course overall--may seem disjointed and lacking in substance at first, but after reviewing for the final exam, I was amazed at how everything really came together and at the depth of the material. Having James Brandt as a TF is really what made the course for me though.</comment>I enjoyed this class much more than I thought I would. I am very much a math/science type of person and so I didn't think that I would really like reasoning through moral problems, but the lectures are great and helped get me excited about the course material.</comment>This course is manageable, very interesting and engaging, and thought provoking. It's not too difficult and doesn't require too much besides section participation, lecture attendance, and readings. The assignments are explained thoroughly and are straight forward.</comment>This class is an interesting course. The material is interesting and Risse is very clearly a genius. However, I think I expected more based on the Q reviews. Also, it's easy to get a B+, takes a little more effort to get an A.</comment>Great opportunity to learn about different topics and apply ethical theories. This is the first class here where I've had to push my own ideas and arguments and learned how to parse arguments.</comment>This course presents itself as an examination at whether different aspects of our global status quo are ethical. Actually, it's a look at whether different aspects of our global status quo are ethical, ASSUMING that morals do exist, ASSUMING that humans can identify what is moral, ASSUMING that we think in the right way to identify what is moral, and ASSUMING that how we feel about something is a good moral argument for or against it. If you have a problem with any of these assumptions, you won't like the course.</comment>Essays are graded very harshly, on very arbitrary criteria. However, it is an amazing class and I highly recommend it if you're interested in issues of morality and justice.</comment>The readings are interesting, but they are nearly all written by white men, and you don't get much of a chance to engage with them during section or lecture. This course was fine for a gen ed, but definitely not as good as an ER class could be.</comment>This course will challenge the way you think about the world and its issues. While I personally wasn't a fan of the teaching style or section, I really appreciate how it made me look at the world.</comment>This course is a lot more philosophy than case study examination. There is immense disparity in TF teaching styles and grading. However, you will gain a new set of skills with which to discuss many common issues.</comment>TAKE IT!!!!! Honestly it's very interesting and Risse is great and you'll truly appreciate the class esp at the end!</comment>Risse has very specific opinions about things that I think some people might feel challenged if they didn't already agree with him? I'm not sure how valid this is as a statement but like I agreed with most of the things he was saying so it was kinda cool.</comment>Great ethical reasoning class where you learn quite a bit about a number of modern ethics issues. Very low stress, just try to go to lectures, since they aren't bad and are pretty useful for the assignments.</comment>The class is a really interesting, thought-provoking discussion of issues that actually matter today. I guarantee this will be more relevant to you than ER-18. However, the papers' topics and structures are very rigid and you should expect to be knocked down a couple of notches grade-wise for relatively superficial things.</comment>The material is interesting. However, Professor Risse's rambling in lectures and the poor section structure makes this course difficult to follow and results in having to learn a lot of the materials on your own.</comment>Interesting subjects discussed.</comment>I really enjoyed this class, because I am greatly passionate about the subject material. However, this class is not for everyone. It requires serious thought and is demanding in terms of its reading and writing (the paper topics were difficult). Nevertheless, this is the perfect class for people who want to dabble in moral and political philosophy but do not want to concentrate in it!</comment>This class is not too bad and offers a good perspective with regard to globalization. Very straightforward and applicable to other issues.</comment>If you care about international justice, are looking for a good ethical reasoning class to finish the requirement, or enjoy diving into complex discussions, take this class. It is a great level of difficulty for a fourth class if your other classes are more challenging. If you do take this class, try to get James as a TF. As my TF, he always spurred my section into challenging yet interesting debates. He did a great job of always pushing us with counterexamples or difficult questions, goading us into engaging in deeper thinking about immigration, free trade, human rights, or whatever else we were discussing that day.</comment>I would definitely recommend this course for anyone interested in moral philosophy and global justice. This is a great way to fulfill the ER requirement. The workload is reasonable, and I found the class particularly interesting because all of the issues discussed are still global issues today.</comment>These are topics I -as a person in the midst of deciding my future- was really interested in. It's super important to lend time to thinking about how much of ones life should be devoted to helping those in need. This was the topic of the course was half the semester. We then seemed to go in odd directions -trade, immigration, climate change-. These are also important to dicuss, but should have whole classes devoted to each subject individually. To tackles such big subjects in two lectures each was odd and too vague. So I would say take this course if you're willing to think about these issues, but know that it will only scratch the surface. At the end, it will be about memorizing philosophers' thesis and not developing your own individual thoughts.</comment>This class was awesome.</comment>Incredibly well-organized. Lectures, readings, and discussions complement each other very well. ER 30 section is what every Harvard discussion section should look like. If you're interested in ethical reasoning, this class is a gem!</comment>I enjoyed this course a lot - definitely one of the most interesting options for fulfilling the ER requirement.  I did feel that the grading in the course was rather unfair/arbitrary and now really related to the quality of work that was turned in, which was a bit disappointing.  Besides that, I enjoyed the course and would recommend it if you're looking for a straightforward and simple way to knock out Ethical Reasoning.</comment>This class is easy but studying for the final will be annoying if you don't do the readings/attend lecture during the semester.</comment>This is a fantastic gen-ed and you will learn a great deal.  Professor Risse is wonderful and very clear when explaining philosophical arguments and the section leaders are super helpful too.   I would say it is not easy at all; challenging readings and the essays are not graded nicely at all.</comment>Too much reading and sections are too strict and serious.</comment></course>MATH 212a: Real Analysis</title>Useful stuff for budding analysts (of which I've noticed there aren't many here...) although the material is blown by at an extremely rapid clip</comment>Well organized and not that much work. The problem sets are often very basic, so you may not come out understanding the material as deeply as you want to.</comment>Great for people with solid background in what you would usually learn in a "normal" real analysis class. This class will then give new perspective on some of those materials. Otherwise you would have to work hard before being able to appreciate the beauty of things taught in class. But definitely this is compensated by a stress-free learning environment (no exams), so I guess the real purpose of this class is "learn what you wish to learn out of the class".</comment>Easiest math class I have ever taken.</comment></course>FRSEMR 31g: The Pleasures of Japanese Poetry: Reading, Writing, and Translation</title>This class is very enjoyable especially if you love poetry and the classics. Also if you have an interest in japanese history this course is very good in introducing some background in a different perspective. And the readings are very nice, read themm.</comment></course>CELLBIO 226: Concepts in Development, Self-Renewal, and Repair</title>It`s an amazing class where you can learn a ton about the current status of the stem cell field form experts. The instructors are very committed and help you develop a lot as a critical thinker.</comment>Enjoyment of class depends strongly upon cohort and willingness to discuss and debate topics, although Iain and Amar are excellent at facilitating discussion and asking good questions.</comment>This course is a great way to come upto speed on the concept of "stem cells" and its application to both physiologic mechanisms and in the setting of cancer.</comment></course>PHYSICS 253a: Quantum Field Theory I</title>It is a huge commitment and to get the most out of it, make sure you don't take too heavy of a schedule/</comment>QFT is essentially two classes in one. 1. Learn the rules. 2. Think a CRAPTON about what you just did and why. Schwartz does a pretty good job in leading you though the math and the thought process, but the quality of his lectures decline as the semester progresses, and the textbook can often be more interesting than the class.</comment>Rewarding (if you're motivated enough), but a lot of work. Clear space in your schedule if you're planning to take it.</comment>Memorize all the algebraic shortcuts that happen in lecture and section--if you do not realize to use them or cannot use them very comfortably, problem sets will take about an extra 10hrs/week. Keep up with problem sets as they take way too much time to allow easy catchups.</comment>it's qft so you have to take it</comment>Schwartz is AWESOME. Love the class. I actually think I kind of get renormalization now!</comment>If you love physics even a little bit and Professor Schwartz is teaching it, you must take this class. His presentation of QFT is not to be missed. The problem sets can be a lot of work but they're usually not tedious and at the end you find that you covered an incredible amount of material. The final exam was extremely fair and grading is not really an issue in this class, the focus is on the physics.</comment>This is a great class. Would definitely recommend taking it (if Prof. Schwartz is teaching). The problem sets are well designed and the lecture notes are made available for reference and are extremely helpful.</comment>This class is hard, but is amazingly rewarding, and very fun. This is the real deal, and if you are able to keep up with the material, you will learn a tremendous amount.</comment>Textbook is good, lectures were okay, but the assignments were just awful. Aside from being frustratingly ambiguous, they even had basic typos that had clearly propagated from previous semesters (such as one problem set that claimed electrons were uncharged particles). The existence of these basic typos seems to contradict Prof. Schwartz's claim that great effort had been made to clean up the wording of the assignments from past years.

The mid-semester review process that Prof. Schwartz initiated was, although well-intentioned, quite frustrating as well. From my point of view, Prof. Schwartz seemed to simply criticize the students' feedback without making any real changes. One great example of this was many students' repeated insistence that Prof. Schwartz's index summation notation (ignoring upper vs. lower indices) was ambiguous, to which Prof. Schwartz essentially responded that we were all wrong. I think I understand Prof. Schwartz's point, that we should always assume a Minkowski signature, but there are parts of his own book (Chapter 13 notably) where this convention is ignored, which is what I think added to the confusion.</comment>This class is a great way to learn quantum field theory. At minimum, you will come away with the ability to compute Feynman diagrams. At best, this course will open your eyes to the way that some very fundamental physics manifests itself in real calculations and introduce you to the theoretical framework underlying almost all of modern particle physics (and other fields as well).</comment>I would definitely recommend Quantum Field Theory to students interested in theoretical physics and related fields.  The class gave me a greater understanding of quantum field theory, and it also helped me put topics at the forefront of physics, which are often covered in the news, into mathematical context.  The class also gave me tools, from complex analysis to Feynman diagrams, that will help me in my research beyond the scope of particle physics.</comment></course>PSY 1005: Health Psychology</title>This was a pretty interesting and easy class. It gets a little repetitive though.</comment>This class is poorly-taught, both the professor and TF seem not to care about students' learning. The lectures are all over the place, sometimes bordering on fantastical claims, and section is no better, sometimes section was taught more like a self-help workshop than an academic section. The only redeeming factor is that this class is extraordinarily easy, requiring almost no work outside of class, and really not even attendance at lecture, so if you've signed up for Math 55 and CS 161 in the same semester then maybe this is the course for you.</comment>This is one of those courses that will change the way you 'want' to live your life. It touches on how could you look at things that are happening around you differently. Although some of the things in class might appear to be extreme or radical, but you will see that it is brimming with possibility. The professor, Ellen Langer seems to be a living proof of everything that she teaches. Overall a phenomenal course, highly recommend for anyone with an opened mind.</comment>If you want to learn about ways to avoid stress and live a healthy life, this is the course for you.</comment>This class is easy. Mindfulness is interesting and incredibly relevant. Professor Langer is well-known and well-respected in the field. But the class does not live up to its full potential. I loved this class and what I learned from it, but I've learned about mindfulness before. I would say it had more of an impact on me and the way I think than other classes. So you get out of it what you make of it.</comment>this is awesome if you want to learn ways to cope with the stresses of life. always made me feel good.</comment>Easiest class at Harvard.</comment>There are two main buckets as to why I found this course to be one of the worst I've taken at Harvard: content and execution.

In terms of content, while thought-provoking at times, Professor Langer has a tendency to speak in absolutes and stuff her view down students' throats. For instance, I remember during one lecture she told us that asthma is a psychological disorder; one student said that she had asthma since she was three, and Professor Langer proceeded to tell her that she "just wasn't trying hard enough". 

In terms of execution, the class is very poorly run, due to Professor Mohsen. There have been sections in which Professor Mohsen showed up to a 1-hour section 20 minutes late because he had to "pick up a package". All assignments (e.g. "send in 5 examples of mindlessness in the business world"), while easy, felt like busy-work. Professor Mohsen also started to take random attendance halfway through the semester after class attendance dropped (there is no incentive to come to class after the midterm because there is no final, and the paper has nothing to do with in-class content). 

All in all, this has been one of the worst-taught courses I've taken at Harvard. Take it if you want an easy A (although to be fair, I have no idea how grading works -- Professor Mohsen is possibly the least transparent TF I've ever encountered; I'm just going off of my midterm grade), but don't take it of you don't want to waste 4 hours a week.</comment>You know, after a few weeks I thought Langer and Fatemi were the type to claim that the Polio vaccine causes autism, but after finishing the course I realized they were more the type to claim that you can THINK yourself out of the Iron Lung.</comment>This class is very easy, but do not expect to get much out of it. Langer has done some very interesting things in the study of mindfulness and is nice to listen to, but this course lacked some serious structure.</comment>Professor Langer, I find very funny and I like her lectures. She is always pushing the envelope on what the human brain is capable of. Dr. Fatemi is also a great TF. He asks very deep questions and can convey his message in a poetic and memorable fashion.</comment>professor langer is great and the material is very interesting</comment>Listen to Ellen and buy into what she says.</comment>This class was interesting for the first couple lectures. Professor Langer is a great speaker, and she cares about the material, but it gets very repetitive towards the end of the semester. The section component was not helpful at all. We never talked about what we learned in section, but rather, it felt more like a therapy session. The assignments were very fair though, and it was not terribly difficult.</comment>It honestly baffles me that this course is allowed to be taught at Harvard.  Five minutes in the first lecture will provide you with all of the insight that you will get from the semester.  I personally believe in a lot of the findings of Positive Psychology, and was still shocked by how unscientific and poorly explained many of the findings in this class were.</comment>Prof. Langer is great, very enthusiastic, and like your therapist. However, Professor Mohsen was difficult to communicate with.</comment>This class was a rather easy upper level psychology course. Required minimal work for interesting material. Langer is impressive professor but material can get a little repetitive.</comment>Though the class is a bit unstructured, it has definitely changed the way that I live my life. You really get to learn the dangers of being mindless and the advantages to being mindful. Ellen is hilarious and makes the lectures fun and interactive</comment>This course introduces very interesting material; however, it can get a bit repetitive at times.</comment>This course has interesting material, but it won't really challenge you. The sections are disorganized. Professor is passionate about what she is teaching.</comment>Take this course if you need a course that you do not have to do any work for. You will learn some useful things but most of them will be in the first three classes and then the rest of the semester is a repeat of those lectures.</comment>you better like mindfulness</comment>Take this class! It will help you in all aspects of life.</comment>Professor Langer is fantastic. She knows her stuff. I LOVED the concepts of this course. It's all about positive psychology, and it is applicable to every aspect of our lives. This course altered the way I view events and stress. This course could be a great tool for all Harvard students. HOWEVER, check who the TF is before you take the class. The TF, Dr. Fatemi, RUINED the experience. He was awful, inflexible, taught material that was not relevant to the course. I would tell people to NOT take it if the same TF is teaching. Seriously, make sure you like the TF. That can make a HUGE different.</comment>It's a great class.</comment>Dr. Langer is an amazing scholar and anyone is lucky to study with her.  I enjoyed hearing all about her research and her stories.</comment>Didnt love the class but very easy.</comment>This class is different from any other psychology classes that I have taken at Harvard. Professor Langer is very enthusiastic about the subject and teaches you skills that are very applicable in life which is cool. The class would however have benefitted from being a little bit more structured, as it tended to get a little bit repetitive towards the ned of the semester.</comment>This class is so ridiculous you won't even believe it. Professor Langer gave interesting lectures at first, and the class itself was not very demanding. However, the course was incredibly unorganized and no one knew what was going on. It was very easy, but I would still not recommend taking it because of the logistical headache it will undoubtedly give you.</comment>Very interesting class, just make sure you are ok with learning about the same theory for the whole semester because mindfulness is the topic of  every lecture.</comment>The lectures were great because Professor Langer is great but be prepared for an extremely disorganized class. You will never have a concrete idea of assignments due or when section is meeting etc</comment></course>ITAL 50: Advanced Written Expression. Italy in Other Words</title>Only take it if you're not only fluent in Italian but want to learn how to write academic Italian.</comment>This is a great course! It follows the 30, 40 series really well and focuses on your written Italian, which definitely needs improvement if you have not worked on it otherwise, as 30 and 40 do not hone in on writing skills. You definitely need to spend time reading and analyzing the texts, but definitely do so- it is worth your time!</comment>This is a fantastic class that really helps your Italian. You cover a great range of excellent Italian literature. But be prepared for time-consuming homework.</comment></course>COMPSCI 175: Computer Graphics</title>Gortler is an extremely down-to-earth professor who cares deeply about his students' learning about the field of computer graphics. He's awesome! So's Yuanchen, for that matter.</comment>This is a really great course that teaches you the basics of computer graphics. The problem sets are fun to do and don't take too much time and the material is very straightforward and easy to understand. If you are looking for a broad introduction to computer graphics and a course that isn't too time consuming, then this is the perfect class.</comment>This class serves as a nice intro to and overview of the field of computer graphics, which you'll learn is very rich. There are a lot of potential careers involving graphics, and if you're interested in any of them, this is a good place to start. It's also a nice way to pick up some C++, which is pretty widely used in industry.</comment>Take it if 3D modeling is relevant to any of your passions.</comment>If you want to get into the theory of computer graphics, and then have to deal with endless office hours to finish the psets, this is the class for you. If you want to actually be able to make cool graphics on the computer, do not take this class. By using the horrible language of C++ instead of graphics software, you will not be able to make anything that cool even by the time final projects roll around.</comment>You'll probably enjoy it if you're into art and CS, or if you want to learn more about how your favorite games/digitally animated movies work. You might find it boring if you just randomly decide to sign up to fulfill the CS depth requirement.</comment>If you find graphics interesting, you will like this course. If you don't, you won't. It will not challenge you too much, but you will learn.</comment>A lot of math, most of the time being stuck on homework assignments came down to not getting the math right rather than coding problems. Gortler is an animated lecturer though, and a super chill dude.</comment>Schlomo is amazing and runs very interesting lectures, but the PSets are slightly frustrating. It's a good introduction to OpenGL, but I don't know how much better this class is compared to an online tutorial. Given what I know now, I probably would have just taken another class. There are probably more interesting CS classes that you could take at Harvard.</comment>I recommend this course to anyone who wants to be introduced in the fascinating field of Computer Graphics. The course will equip you with the necessary tools to continue on more advanced topics in CG.</comment>Honestly, it's kind of a bore. But it's low-stress. And the final project is open ended. And no exams.</comment>If you're at all interested in computer graphics, consider taking this class. The lectures are often fairly dry and theoretical, but the problem sets are great and the TFs are super dedicated.</comment>Learning C++ is great. The class itself is relatively straightforward, but I didn't come out of the class enthusiastic about computer graphics. Lectures weren't that effective for me, but sections/office hours are a MUST for your psets.</comment>it's great! take it and i thought buying the book was helpful!</comment>If you're interested in computer graphics, this may be a good way to learn the fundamentals. However the lectures and material are not the most inspiring.</comment></course>VES 40a: Introduction to Still Photography</title>VES 40 is awesome.</comment>Killip is truly inspirational and his devotion to photography is evident. This class is more of a documentary style of photography, so if you like broading your knowledge of photography skills beyond simple pretty pictures, this is the course for you.</comment>This course is absolutely amazing. Chris is the most chill, accommodating and personable professor I have ever had, and Nori is amazing at helping you out with every aspect of the class/project. Could not have asked for a better or more fun class. And you actually learn quite a lot of super useful stuff.</comment>This course is really a hit or a miss, but I probably would not recommend it unless you have a lot of background, extreme interest in photography, a lot of patience, and a lot of free time in your semester. Basically, the class is structured so you really can't do well in it and there is very little constructive feedback on your work. Instead of telling you how to improve, you'll be left with a diminished sense of your work, because if Chris or Nori don't like your work, it'll automatically be deemed bad. I always left this class feeling worse about myself as an artist and feeling inadequate and unhappy about my work. Again, I would not take this as an easy, fun elective. It's just not worth the 5 hours you'll spend perfecting just one picture on Photoshop, only to hear in class that your work is inadequate.</comment>Choose to work on the final project on the topic that most interests you and inspires you.That way you will have fun working on making a photo book in the end, and your genuine interest will be shown in the quality of the project.</comment>Every taken a picture and want to take more? This class will make you better, and you'll have fun along the way. Chris and Nori both rock as people and as photographers, so don't miss the opportunity to take this class.</comment>This is a fantastic course to take if you are looking for an introduction to photography. You learn so much about not only the physical act of shooting, but how to edit the photos in Photoshop. You acquire skills that will last a life time. However, this class takes ALOT of time. You should not be going into this class thinking it will be your "light" course. It takes a lot of time just to shot the dang photos, and even more time to edit them, and as you are new to this, you will constantly feel like you could be doing more. You will do a disservice to yourself if you do not spend as much time as possible on your photos. You also won't realize how much of a giant Chris is in the field of Photography. Get to know him. He is a good contact to have.</comment>Great for picking up Photoshop skills and learning your way around the camera. The grading is more or less subjective -- you will come into class one day with photos that you think are awesome and get shut down (in the nicest way possible). Just stick with it and keep shooting. You can never have enough images.</comment>TAKE THIS CLASS! It is by far the most rewarding class I have ever taken at Harvard. The classroom dynamic is very unstructured and relaxed, and both Chris and Nori give really insightful and helpful feedback. Also, they both bring humor and interesting stories to the class discussion. You will gain useful Photoshop skills and have access to all the free materials and software you could possibly want. This class is very time-consuming, but so, so worthwhile and rewarding. I highly recommend this class.</comment>I didn't learn much and felt like the two three-hour classes we had each week went to waste. You don't develop personal style but rather end up catering to what you think your professor will like.</comment>Great course! Killip is really cool.</comment>It's a lot of time. If you have a fairly easy course load and want a fun elective it's a great class. But the class itself is six hours plus any extra time you need to spend in the lab. So make sure you have the time to put into the class.</comment>Really awesome course if photography is a skill that you are at all interested in developing. This will be something that I use throughout the rest of my life, so I found it to be an invaluable course. You will learn photoshop and you will at the end of it have a series of beautiful photos and a book to display them all in.</comment>Fantastic course! One you will not regret taking while at Harvard! Chris is amazing, a pleasure to hear him speak.  He is a wise and talented man!</comment></course>HINDI-URDU 101: Introductory Hindi-Urdu</title>Ask for help when needed and keep on top of the work--it adds up!</comment>If you're interested in learning a new language and new script absolutely consider it!</comment>Amy and Nicholas are great! Really good way to fulfill your language requirement, even if you have no exposure. Can be fast paced at times though.</comment>It's a great way for beginners to learn the languages.</comment>I would just say that if you have never had exposure to this language, make sure to go to office hours. The material isn't hard but it takes time to master and the class is very fast paced thuspractice as much as possible!</comment>Hindi-Urdu is a great class if you're at all interested in ever travelling to South Asia. The regularity of class helps you practice and both the preceptor and TF are always looking to help you and meet outside of class.</comment></course>MEDVLSTD 107: Authority and Invention: Medieval Art and Architecture</title>It is a great class, but the tests can be tricky and the small essays are more difficult than you think. If you are an undergrad think twice about taking this course. It is not an easy gen ed, though the material is fantastic.</comment>This is a great class for an introduction to Art history. The material spans a long time period but ties together themes very well. It is a decent bit of work and much harder than most gen eds, but also much more rewarding. If you are looking to learn about art history, take it! The Medieval ages are pretty interesting, and its fascinating starting with the Classical era and seeing how it continues to influence things even 1500 years later.</comment>A great class with fascinating material, as long as you are interested in the topic! Christine Smith's lectures are phenomenal, and Matt is a great TF.</comment></course>HISTSCI 100: Knowing the World: An Introduction to the History of Science</title>It is important to recognize that this is really a history class--it involves lots of reading and memorization. The class is somewhat time-consuming, but the material is not too challenging. I would only recommend this class if you really have a passion for the history of science--not just as a gen ed or elective.</comment>Professor Csiszar is an excellent teacher and lecturer and every class was more interesting than the next. He really generates enthusiasm for the subject matter and is excited to meet and work with students individually, as well.</comment>This class provides a good introduction to the history of science. The course material was interesting and presented in a way that inspired thinking. The essays for the class were somewhat difficult but manageable. There were 80-100 pages of reading a week from old, historical documents.</comment>I took this class as a senior and unfortunately thought this was basically a worse version of sophomore tutorial (which I loved). The teaching staff was great (Prof. Csiszar is really enthusiastic and obviously loves the material) but I don't think the class accurately represents the concentration, which is a main goal of the class. I think it could be improved by modeling it more on sophomore tutorial: case studies from different time periods in history to help students engage. I think an emphasis on thought provoking papers rather than the typical midterm/final format would also be beneficial. I gave the class a 3 because I love the material, but feel it really needs a revamp in structure.</comment>This is course is exactly what you would think of when someone said the history of science. It's a bit tedious, yet can be somewhat interesting. One of those that I would probably not recommend as an elective but it's not a terrible requirement course and you have to take it for hist of sci. Grading was pretty fair and section was helpful yet boring.</comment>This class is really interesting for a great understanding of the history of science and scientists. It gave me background that I had never before heard in a science or history class.</comment>great intro to the history of science</comment>Professor cszisar was great, but the course material overall wouldn't be very interesting if you aren't interested in the history of science. Useful info to know, though!</comment>Great class. This class will make you a better student, citizen, and individual overall if you make the most of it. Hopefully they will provide course packs with the readings from now on. Work hard on the papers and participate!</comment>Very fun and interesting course.</comment>As a hist of sci concentrator, i loved this course!! The workload is not too heavy and is really consistent, lectures are engaging and interesting, there's a topic for everyone.</comment>This class shares some cool insights into scientific developments over time. They had a very specific way they wanted you to see each of these scientific historical eras though so if you didn't align with their views on assignments you were unlucky.</comment>Extremely worthwhile if you're interested in American and British history as well as the scientific pursuits in the past 500 years.</comment>This course is a great way to see if you're interested in History of Science.  Just note that this is a survey course and so you won't got into anything as in-depth as you like.  However, the work load is quite manageable and the professor is really friendly and engaging.</comment>Be prepared to read texts that have many terms/concepts that can fly over your head.</comment>Taking this is worthwhile in every way: a wealth of totally fascinating information, a lot of interesting readings and it's not a killer time commitment.</comment>Be sure to do the readings and be able to map their concepts over time. Additionally, go to office hours as much as possible. The staff is great resource to better understanding the material. Don't skip lecture! The lectures are too interesting to miss and if you miss one there is a hole in your understanding.</comment>HS100 is a fantastic class! Professor Csiszar is an excellent lecturer, the teaching staff is super helpful, and you will learn a ton. That being said, since the units cover so many different topics inevitably there will be some weeks where the readings feel tedious and boring and others where you're wildly interested in the topic. That being said, it's worth working through the more tedious weeks because overall you get a great sense of how we got to science as it is today how people approached scientific study in the past.</comment>take it if you want to major in hist/sci or if you are interested in the topic quite a bit</comment>This is a very interesting class with great instructors. If you are interested in knowing more about science and society, how science has developed, or anything like that, it is a fun course to take.</comment>Great survey class, especially if you are considering this for a major.</comment>Do all of the readings!</comment>Keep up with the readings and don't slack off.</comment>don't take it unless you need it for history and science concentration; it is not all indicative of the types of classes you take in the concentration but it is a requirement so just push through</comment>This course often gets a bad wrap, but I really enjoyed it. If you are interested in science, it is cool to read the original papers of the figures and names you hear thrown around so much. Its also really interesting history challenging your conceptions of what "doing science" actually means. There is a lot of reading, which can be quite dense, but overall fun.</comment>Great introduction to the history of Western science - super low time commitment. If you can get Leah as a TF do it, she made the course for me.</comment>Reading for this class is super helpful but attending lectures are imperative.</comment>Loved this class! Goes into a lot of the "big hits" in the history of science, but spends a great deal of time on the 20th century, including war science, genetics, and biotechnology. I had to take it as a concentration requirement, but I would recommend it as a Gen Ed to those interested in studying how science is a product of the culture and politics of various time periods!</comment>Professor Csiszar is an excellent and enthusiastic lecturer.  The course gives such a broad base of knowledge throughout many centuries, but really offers a good grasp of movements that have developed science as we know it today.  I would urge anyone interested in science to take it!  The TFs are also great at explaining and readily available to help.</comment>Don't take this course for general education. It's too much work (2 exams, 3 essays, and a whole lot of reading). If you like to do all of these things and want to learn about the history of science from a very Eurocentric and male perspective, then this is your course!</comment>I would recommend this course because the lectures were great. They were interesting and held my attention the entire time. Section was sometimes boring, but if you do the readings it makes section much easier.</comment>awesome class -- I highly recommdend it!</comment>This class is super fun and not too demanding.  A great way to check out a super cool department and fill a gen ed in the process.</comment>This course truly teaches you about the ways in which people have engaged with studying the world. It addresses matters of natural philosophy, natural history, hard sciences, social sciences, statistics, government, and more. It provides invaluable insight into the development of what we consider science today. The professor and TFs are amazing, the readings are fascinating, the assignments are fun and engaging.</comment>I stumbled upon this course as I was searching for CB gen eds. And though courses like CB 34 or CB 23 are popular, I was really happy and grateful that I came across this one. For someone who generally dislikes learning history, this course really synthesized the science with the narrative. As a scientist and natural science major, I felt that all the physics and chemistry and biology that I had learned was effectively contextualized, placed in the arc of events such as the Industrial Revolution or WWII. The exams are very reasonable, and although there is a fair amount of work between preparing for section, doing the primary source readings (DO THEM! they're fantastic and chosen to give the biggest punch for the least amount of pages), writing papers, and taking exams, I felt I gained a lot about the context of science in the past 400 years. Teaching staff was fantastic as well, and Prof Csiszar is truly passionate about what he does.</comment>Pretty good class. I do not like lecture based History of Science classes, but I enjoyed this class.</comment>This class gives a very good overview of how science has progressed from the past. It does not have much to do with actual scientific experiments or processes, but rather, how individuals thought about science. It is very philosophical and ambiguous in some manners, but ultimately you come out of the class feeling more grounded in your understanding of how science came to be what it is considered as now.</comment>This class seems to have a reputation for being dull, but I think that's just the nature of intro classes.  You can't delve nearly as deep into particular topics as you'd like, which can be frustrating.  The class was pretty good though. Dani was a great TF.  The exams were pretty easy and the assignments were fairly graded, and if you are at all interested in history of science there will be at least a few interesting topics and persons covered in the course.</comment>DO NOT make this your intro HistSci course or your C&B Gen Ed requirement. It is not very representative of the rest of the HistSci courses, I'd suggest taking it once you're pretty sure you want to concentrate in HisSci. As a GenEd, it is a lot more work than a GenEd should be- 3 papers, a midterm and a final.</comment>This course is a good way to ease yourself into freshman year.</comment>This is a fantastic course and I think everyone should take it.  For a gen ed class, it is rather work intensive but I deeply appreciate what I've learned in this class.  Also, Prof Csiszar is a GREAT lecturer.  He's funny and adorable.  Also, what a snappy dresser!  I know you've seen this Csiszar. You are killin' the blazer game (if you don't understand my slang, that's a good thing).</comment>HS100 is a great class. I had heard that it was dry, but I never found this to be the case, and I am not someone who is particularly interested in science (although I do like history). This class offers something for everyone, and you can really shape your experience it. That being said, what makes this class so special is the teaching staff. Prof. Cziszar really cares about his students and about making lectures engaging and informative. The entire course is super well organized. TFs are also universally great, and both enthusiastic and knowledgable. The workload is completely manageable, and the readings are normally interesting. One small note is that the grading on the exams is relatively tough, although the exams themselves aren't too difficult. If you do the readings for the most part, and come to lecture, you will be prepared. I really would recommend this class without reservations. It makes you look at science in a new way, and I felt like I was learning something new and exciting each week. Take this class!</comment>This was a good class and a good way to satisfy the Culture and Belief requirement. The lectures are well done and the readings are interesting. This is an especially good way to satisfy this Gen Ed, if you are interested in science. The workload is manageable, but doing the readings is definitely crucial to get the most out of the class.</comment>Even though it is an introductory course, Professor Csiszar is incredibly enthusiastic about the material and makes the lectures interesting. This class confirmed my decision to concentrate in history of science.</comment>The workload is not too bad, but be prepared to read a lot of dense, primary sources and analyze them.</comment>Very interesting material.  Reasonable course load.  Teaching staff is very nice and helpful.</comment>This is a nice intro to the history of science department. It has an interesting selection of readings. The papers are somewhat hard/ require significant work to get A's but they are manageable.</comment>Its a good class. Some of the material is dry but there are also very interesting parts.</comment>Fantastic guide to scientific thought and history from a very liberal perspective!</comment>TAKE IT IF YOU LIKE HISTORY AND SCIENCE</comment>Be an active participant and you will appreciate this class much more.</comment>-- Do not judge the history of science department from this class alone; the class is much too broad at times but overall, a good way to appreciate the big themes in science and the practice/understanding of science</comment>I would tell future students that this is a fascinating class.  It is an excellent gen ed to take if you're interested in pursuing a STEM field because it shows how science and research has evolved over modern time and brings up current issues in the research world.</comment>HS100 is a great class, especially for students with strong interests in both the humanities and sciences. The lectures are engaging, and it is exciting to have the opportunity to read on monumental works in the history of science – including the writings of Galileo, Newton, Darwin, and other scientific revolutionaries. While such texts could be daunting at first, the guidance offered by Professor Csiszar and the TFs helped me to understand and reflect on the readings in meaningful ways. A highlight of the course was visiting Houghton Library, where we examined and even flipped through original texts by Darwin, Linnaeus, and Buffon.  

It is important to note that the essays and exams in this course are quite challenging. The take-home essay questions often have multiple parts, and the midterm and final exams require you to write several essays in a short period of time. Still, if you’re up for a challenge, this course is definitely worth taking and will greatly shape and develop your understanding of the practice of scientific research – both in the present day and throughout the broader arc of history.</comment>This course is interesting if you want to learn about the history of scientific inquiry and how science has developed into what it is today. The lectures and readings can be boring so if you're considering it as an elective it's informative but not the most interesting course.</comment>The class is not recorded and it's kind of hard to learn material if you miss class, so only take it if you actually intend to go to class or if you know other people who will make it easier to catch up on missed material. That being said, lectures were very good and interesting. Section experience will vary, depending on the students, but generally section was really helpful in understanding readings and connecting them to the overall themes of the course. The papers are pretty easy if you know what's going on and they always offer a variety of prompts on the first two papers.</comment></course>AESTH&INTP 40: Monuments of Islamic Architecture</title>A lot of the mosques start to look similar -- courtyard, column, arcades</comment>A really chill course to see some awesome Islamic monuments, and moreover learn about how crucial a role these monuments played in solidifying the rule of Islamic dynasties throughout its 1300-year history!</comment>A great introduction to what it means to study Islamic Architecture while simultaneously providing a phenomenalsurvey of some truly amazing works.</comment>You get to see nice things built by interesting people!</comment>It is a very easy course, but the material presented during lecture is very dense.</comment>The subject matter is incredibly interesting, and you get to learn a lot about some buildings (Dome of the Rock, the Alhambra, the Great Mosque at Cordoba, and the Taj Mahal) that you've always known about but have probably never read up on. However, the lectures sometimes get a bit too dense when they really should have been a bit more introductory in nature.</comment>This course is a great way to learn about Islam, architecture and history. Learning about the various aspects of these great monuments makes one very appreciative of the amount of thinking and the symbolism that was involved.</comment>Easy class. You can learn a lot about Islamic history and Muslim societies.</comment>Really great gen ed, or concentration class! No prior knowledge on Islamic history or architecture is necessary. Not much in the way of readings / assignments, but you learn a lot in a semester. I highly recommend this class!</comment>Kind of dull at times.  The work wasn't hard, but the material could be repetitively dry.  Not a bad way to get the AIU requirement done with, but definitely not the most exciting material.</comment>This was an absolutely wonderful class.  Not too much work, and all the work assigned was interesting and central to the core themes of the class.  The professors and TF are classy and knowledgeable.  This was a great class, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.</comment>Great course with a light workload, nice TFs who are willing to provide great feedback prior to and after the assignment is due. The class can be a bit dry if you have never taken architecture before but if you like being taken on tours with knowledgable guides take this course</comment>Many History of Art and Architecture concentrators took this class and section discussions were often over my head and I did not feel that I could contribute anything. Relatively painless way to fulfill AIU gen ed requirement. Only 3 essays. No final exam or midterm. Lectures were engaging, for the most part, although at times there was a disconnect between Roxburgh's lectures and Guru's lectures.</comment>The material may / may not be interesting to you depending on your own interests. In terms of workload, this class is very easy going.</comment>Fantastic material, immensely informative and historically well-grounded lectures. Very much a course where you get out as much as you put in - you can make it very easy or very difficult for yourself.</comment>Although it may be  a  bit more challenging than some AIU classes, it is a really interesting topic. The professors are very knowledgeable and passionate about the topic, and it shows in their lectures.  The section component of this class is also very worthwhile and informative. Overall, a good way to fill your AIU requirement, especially if you like writing.</comment></course>SPANSH C: Intermediate Spanish</title>This is a great review of the basics of the Spanish language and is helpful for those who feel that a review of Spanish would be helpful before going onto advanced level classes.</comment>This class was awesome and a painless way to improve your grasp of the language. The class focuses primarily on grammar and writing, very little vocab and only a couple presentations. Senora Lujan is the best!</comment>This is a typical Spanish course.</comment>The class does not have a lot of work, but in order to actually learn a language, it is necessary to put in the extra hours. And those extra hours will be worth it!</comment>This a great class and Martha is awesome!</comment>Maria is the best TF ever! Definitely try to take the course with her. She is always available to you and makes sure that everyone is on the same page. The coursework is manageable but needs to be done nightly to ensure you don't fall behind. Overall, a great class because the more I spoke in class, the easier it was to speak Spanish outside the classroom.</comment>It is a good class to learn Spanish while in school because it makes us speak Spanish at least one hour every day.</comment>I found it difficult, but I don't think my skills were developed enough to take this course. Make sure you can have discussions easily in spanish because the entire course is conducted in Spanish.</comment>It's different from your high school Spanish classes</comment>It's fantastic! Luigi is a great teacher, and my Spanish writing and speaking improved significantly.</comment>don't take it if you have Luigi!</comment>This is a great class! The workload is not too difficult and the exams are fair.</comment>The TF makes your experience in this class. The workload is not bad at all and the stories that we read are sometimes challenging, but if you spend a little time on them, it's always manageable.</comment>This is a great course for deepening Spanish skills and reviewing grammar, as well as learning about Latin American/Spanish culture and picking up a lot of vocabulary.</comment>This is an amazing class, especially with Martha. Your spanish will improve.</comment>This course is fun, challenging, and engaging.  If you want to become proficient in Spanish, this is a great intermediate-level course.  You will come out with an even greater enthusiasm and appreciation for the language.</comment>It was solid and fun.</comment>This class really helps you to have a very firm and complete foundation before continuing on to higher levels of the language.</comment>The class was fun, laid back, and great for improving Spanish ability. They don't spend a lot of time actually teaching the grammar points in class, so it's helpful to be at the level where you can consider that to be mostly review (and/or be disciplined about doing grammar drills on your own). The strength of this class lies in the opportunities that it gives you to use Spanish spontaneously in class discussion, so speak up as much as you can.</comment>The literature component of this class is quite challenging. Be aware of that. Also, grammar is taught very swiftly so be prepared to spend a lot of time out of class getting better at that if you're not rock solid.</comment>Course with an easy workload, but not difficult enough for students that desire to become fluent in Spanish.</comment>This class is a lot of fun if you enjoy spanish! You learn a lot through some interesting exercises and stories. It's important to actually read the stories and review on your own time.</comment>This class is great for anyone interesting in furthering their grasp of Spanish grammar and for getting an overview of Spanish culture, through artists and authors, contemporary issues, like immigration and gang-related kidnappings, and essay writing. The articles we read, along with the movie and interviews we watched were all very helpful for understanding the language through discussion and reflection. The class is largely discussion based, especially regarding the analysis of readings, which is good for learning culture and language. María is a great teacher with a clear, accented voice so it makes it very easy to follow along. I recommend this course.</comment>This is a great class to get into language studies at Harvard.</comment>If you do decide to take it, commit to it. You get out what you put it</comment>This class is a great way to improve your speaking and fulfill necessary graduation requirements.</comment>It's easy, just do the assignments.</comment>This class was frustrating to me because it felt exactly like Spanish AB from the previous semester, minus the fun. You learn the exact same grammar you've learned a hundred times without improving your speaking skills at all. Also don't take 9am class everyday.</comment>Maria is a FANTASTIC teacher. You will learn a lot in her class. The projects are fun and the readings are fascinating. Definitely take this course if you are interested in improving your Spanish!</comment>The environment's great, and you really learn Spanish well! You take out what you put in.</comment>This is a fantastic way to extend your knowledge past high school Spanish. Maria makes class really enjoyable, and I appreciated how supportive she was.</comment>I actually enjoyed this class more than I thought I would. I had three years of high school Spanish, a little informal experience from traveling, and then took a year off from Spanish and it was about the right level for me. I don't know if it was just my section, but there seemed to be a lot of people that were slightly over-qualified. As far as content, we covered various stories and poems from different Spanish-speaking countries and were actually exposed to some pretty serious issues. All the grammar is completely review. While we had a fair amount of discussion, I don't feel like my speaking skills improved very much. There's a reasonable amount of work that is spaced out well.  Martha is a great TF, very enthusiastic, and tries to make sure everyone is included in discussions. Overall, it's a solid language class, and an enjoyable break from the other kinds of classes at Harvard.</comment>Be aware that you're expected to speak Spanish at all times</comment></course>ESPP 90x: Current Issues in U.S. Environmental Law</title>Anyone remotely interested in environmental governance in the U.S. should take this class. I went in with a very cursory understanding of U.S. environmental law, but have left with a wealth of applicable knowledge that I will certainly use for the remainder of my academic and professional careers.</comment>Shaun is extremely knowledgeable and his passion for the subject matter definitely translates to the class. Solid survey of environmental law. Would highly recommend this class because there aren't others like it in the college, and definitely worth walking to the law school for.</comment>This is a great course if you have any interest in the law or the environment (especially the intersection of the two)- but is also a great way just to begin immersion into the field of legal studies if you are considering law school. This will give you the option to look at some legal readings in a friendly atmosphere</comment>This is a cool class to take if you want to learn about major env. policies and get a taste for what reading cases is like. The readings can be a lot, but often a skimming of the readings is sufficient to get the major points. Shaun is extremely knowledgable and allows for good discussion in class.</comment>This class is great not only if you want to learn more about environmental law, but also about law in general!</comment>Take this class if you're at all interested in environmental law! It's a very good introduction, and I learned a lot. ESPP concentrators should definitely take it. Also, Shaun is great and a very good person to talk to (even about environmental or law issues not covered in this class).</comment></course>PHYSICS 151: Mechanics</title>If Xi Yin is teaching the course, expect it to be very, very difficult. Material is covered extremely quickly, and you are expected to have a pretty solid grasp on most of it to do the homework (and the homework can get hairy). Goldstein is very dense and reading through it was almost physically painful, but you have to go through some of the chapters to understand what's going on in class. If the main reason you're taking this class is extra preparation for Quantum, don't take it; the overlap isn't too large, and the class is way too hard.  On the other hand, you learn some beautiful mechanics in this course, and you get an introduction to chaotic systems, which is pretty cool. If you really want to know more about mechanics, this is a good course to take.</comment>With Xi Yin, the class is very difficult (especially because the problem sets were very challenging)! But it was extremely rewarding. Take this class to see some really beautiful physics! We used theory to explore a lot of systems in a very practical way (by which I mean, mining invariants and other nice properties out of them). You'll get a lot of experience with transforming Hamiltonians and examining the systems that they describe. The slightly abstracted systems we studied in chaos were also very interesting! It was a lot of fun, and I feel like it taught me a lot about how to apply theory to attack a problem.</comment>This is a great class for math students (physics students might find it a bit too math-y). It covers really interesting material that is beyond standard intro mechanics.   Professor Yin also made this course excellent. He explains the material in an intuitive manner and is very accessible outside of class. He also made great use of Mathematica demonstrations in class and the problem sets which really helped visualize our study of dynamics.</comment>There will never be another 151 like this one.</comment>This class introduced us to some truly fascinating ideas - studying chaos and perturbation theory, for instance, proved as exciting and interesting as it sounds - although the pace of the lectures often did make it hard to keep up. The lectures show you deep connections between abstract math and advanced mechanics that are very rewarding to encounter. On the other hand, if future problem sets are like the ones we had, be prepared to use a LOT of mathematica for almost uniformly brutal computations. At the very least, though, you will come out with a thorough understanding of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, and the tools or starting points to explore some fascinating areas of physics.</comment>I've heard that in the past Physics 151 was an easy, fun course. Under Xi Yin, this is most definitely not the case. Professor Yin is a very uneven lecturer: sometimes he dazzles with his ability to make connections between concepts and the clarity of his teaching, other times he is completely incomprehensible, barreling through the material at a breakneck pace. The psets are biweekly, but don't let that trick you into thinking the workload is easily manageable: I spent more time on this course than on any other in my entire college career. The material is very interesting, but difficult to truly grasp, in part because much of the material is typically taught to graduate students, and also because of the confusing teaching. Only take this course if you're really confident in your physics skills, and extremely talented at Mathematica.</comment>If it's being taught by Professor Yin, the course will be hard. However, the material is fascinating. A lot of it will take time to sink in, and I think you'll only really put the pieces together at the end.</comment>When taught by Xi Yin, this course is very, very difficult (that said, it was his first year teaching the course, and in future years he'll probably tone it down a bit). I took Physics 210 concurrently, and for most of the semester this class was more difficult to fully grasp. Definitely take Physics 16 beforehand, and taking Math 25 probably wouldn't be a bad idea just because of the amount of math used. Goldstein was technically our textbook, but the professor jumped everywhere and often takes different approaches than the book (which is alright, though no lecture notes were ever posted and section notes were only posted at the very end of the course). The class started out extremely difficult, but the work got a bit easier towards the end (though the material was still very abstract and difficult to understand). Proficiency in Mathematica is a must! When taught by Jaffe, this course is supposedly fairly easy.</comment>Fun, but really really really hard and frustrating sometimes.</comment>This class is fun, but requires a lot of time.</comment>I took it pass/fail, so my take on the class perhaps not totally representative - but I really liked it!</comment>This was an insanely hard class under Prof Yin, but we learned so many cool things! If you enjoyed mechanics I even a little, you will love this class. To end with chaotic systems was amazing, to learn about the hamiltonian and lagrangian formulation is a must.</comment>I don't think Xi's iteration of the class is quite like Jaffe's. This year's 151 -- apparently unlike previous iterations -- was far from laid back and easy. Xi tries very hard to make it easy -- by his standards -- but somehow fails to do so for most students. Still, it certainly does not mean you should not take it with him. For one thing, any physics concentrator MUST know Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalism, in more sophistication then what is covered in 16. Moreover, Xi's teaching might be harder to follow -- and Goldstein's textbook was virtually useless for most of us -- but I definitely feel like he brings the perspective of a very modern physicist to classical mechanics. He teaches topics in a very unique way (hence why the textbook is useless) but is perspective is modern and very powerful. His teaching of mechanics invites extension into modern physics and I appreciated that. Xi can be very intimidating and you will often feel like you are asking dumb questions, but he never condescends and always answers very kindly.</comment>This is a very challenging course. It is, however, an excellent first step into theoretical physics.</comment>My year might be an outlier, with this being the first year it's taught by the current professor, but I think it'll just get better with time.</comment>Lectures for this course were quite enjoyable if sometimes confusing. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in topics in classical mechanics - the problem sets demand effort and time, but if you can provide those this class is quite worthwhile.</comment>This course's material was fascinating, although some advanced topics were presented probably without enough explanation or preparation. Our TF Will was amazing and really helped me get a lot out of the class, but lectures were at times hard to understand without his help.</comment></course>AFRAMER 90r.n: Tigrinya</title>All students should take this class if you are eager to learn a new language or build off your previous knowledge because the class engaging and has a lot to offer.</comment></course>ENGLISH Ctr: Advanced Fiction Writing: Workshop</title>There's nothing special or out of the ordinary about the workshop structure. But Brett is a great reader who gives incisive criticism and runs the classroom well.</comment>If you take this class, very smart people will read your writing very carefully and give you very helpful feedback about it. What an amazing gift.</comment>This is such a rewarding class! You will grow as a writer, and as a reader!</comment>If you get in, definitely take it.</comment>Fantastic workshop. Strikes a great balance of being a relaxed environment in which we are able to openly share our stories and ideas without any discomfort and being a place we can come to get honest, hard-hitting feedback. Bret is the best moderator and editor around, and selects kids for workshop with fantastic things to write and say-- expect a diverse class in personal interests, writing styles, and life experiences. Exactly what you'd want out of a workshop.</comment></course>SANSKRIT 102ar: Intermediate Sanskrit I</title>Holy crap. Tyler. Tyler is a rockstar and a saint, and you can count yourself SUPREMELY fortunate if you get to work with him. Never have I met an educator so genuinely concerned with the well being of his students, and who would work so hard to ensure that you have not only knowledge but a deep understanding of the material. He is fair and he is not out to get you. He just loves Sanskrit and wants you to too. He consistently went out of his way to provide amazing supplementary materials that make this difficult language so much more approachable. He deserves to be promoted to professorship immediately..</comment>It is awesome!!</comment>Terrific teachers, the most wonderful language - Deva vaaNi</comment></course>PHYSICS 223: Electronics for Scientists</title>This is a very useful class, especially if you are interested in getting a working knowledge of electronics, at a level that allows you to understand the inner workings of electronic circuits.</comment></course>RUSS 111: Advanced Russian: Readings in Russian/Post-Soviet Studies</title>Great class - lots of speaking practice and the vocabulary lists are reinforced through the readings</comment>This course is especially relevant if you're into post-Soviet politics and follow current events in the region. If not, then it provides great opportunities to get more familiar with the region. Take advantages of the opportunities to expand your vocabulary as well.</comment>You'll get a lot out of this class as long as you do the reading and participate in class. It is much easier if you have background knowledge about Eastern Europe and Central Asia.</comment></course>ENG-SCI 240: Solid Mechanics</title>Professor Vlassak is great! Challenging class, but you will learn a ton. Also, Yecheng was an awesome and helpful TF!</comment>I wish I had bought or borrowed a copy of the Timoshenko book that was on reserve in the library. I did visit the library read it a couple times but might have benefitted from easier access and thus more time spent reading it.</comment>Professor Vlassak is an amazing lecturer, and you will really learn the fundamentals of solid mechanics. If you don't have much background, learning the material and doing the problem sets will require a lot of time.</comment>This is a very traditional course in solid mechanics, but it totally nails it. Joost is a great lecturer, and is always happy to stay after class and discuss whatever is on your mind. The lecture notes are comprehensive and very helpful. Assignments are occasionally long but are very fair and reinforce the lecture content. This course is a must for anyone considering studying mechanical engineering.</comment></course>US-WORLD 36: Innovation and Entrepreneurship: American Experience in Comparative Perspective</title>This is one of the best classes I have taken at Harvard. It is one of the only classes I feel actually taught me tangible skills and ways of thinking about real world business problems and opportunities. The case study method provided an effective and really quite amazing way to learn about particular areas within business and entrepreneurship, and I can honestly say that as a senior, I feel more prepared to go out into the world and start something of my own after taking this class.</comment>prepare for class!</comment>Take this class. Whether you have your own startup or have no plans of starting one, USW 36 will be the one class you have to take at Harvard. It's the best Gen-Ed class I've ever taken, and probably one of the best I ever will take. David and Mihir are amazing, and the guest professors they bring are leaders in their field. Nowhere else will you get this kind of opportunity unless you go to HBS! Just make sure to read the case and prepare, and you will have no regrets.</comment>dont overestimate the time it will take to complete the final project</comment>This is one of the best courses taught at Harvard. You will be able to experience the case study method and learn from top business professors. The material was interesting, the class was engaging and you will learn skills that are actually helpful for your future and career.</comment>This class taught me so much and indirectly got me working with a really cool startup. It was the launching pad I needed to get into the startup and business scene on campus. Take it if you can. It is not super hard and every class i extremely engaging.</comment>Literally everything about this course was amazing. The case studies were incredibly engaging. The professors were some of the most inspiring and accomplished people I have ever met. And the final project was my favorite academic project of my life. This class has changed what I want to do with my life.</comment>Absolutely brilliant class. There's a reason why so many people lottery to get in.</comment>The best class I have ever taken at Harvard. Take advantage of the incredible professors that are brought in. Invite them to dinner, invite professor Ager to dinner, and have a wild wild semester.</comment>This class was great.  It gives you basically a sampling of a bunch of different HBS professors, all of whom were outstanding.  The lectures were really the highlight.  I learned to think in a much more business-like / profit-oriented way than I used to.

Be careful what you choose for your final project.  I ended up with a very early-stage startup, which made it pretty tough to figure out what to do.  An established business may be a better call.</comment>Pretty good class, but you must enjoy the case method of teaching.</comment>A great class to learn about business, investment, social entrepreneurship and innovation in different industries and countries. Speak early on. The best part about this class are the discussions. . The portion on personal development makes this course a life class in addition to a business course, many lessons I'll carry with me going forward in life. The final project can be time consuming towards the end of the semester, but its a great way to learn about and work with a business in your field of interest.</comment>I became more aware of process of entrepreneurship in America, as well as the moral decisions one must take in any leadership situation, especially those when one is heading an entrepreneurial venture. It encouraged innovation, and allowed me to view things with a lens that was able to adapt better to a changing world. It inculcated in me an ability to think quick on my feet. HIGHLY RECOMMEND</comment>This class is amazing. You have to take it! I wish I had taken it as a sophomore. My favorite class at Harvard by far!</comment>This class is one of the best I've taken at Harvard. Professor Ager and Professor Desai foster a welcoming environment in class, even if you're not comfortable participating in discussion. The final project was probably the most rewarding part of the class, and it made me realize just how much this case study course has taught me.</comment>Amazing class! Definitely lottery and take the class if you can! learning from case studies is incredibly effective and such a fun way to learn. Also, we get to work with a real client for a final project which is a really fun and great learning experience. I'm a senior, and I probably learned the most from this course in all 7 semesters.</comment>TAKE THIS COURSE! It is the best course I have taken at Harvard. The professors are engaging and all the students are engaged too.</comment>Best class I have ever taken at Harvard. The assignments can be a little bit open ended but otherwise an incredible class.</comment>The participation requirement really kills the course. It could be very rewarding if people weren't trying to get their participation points and raising their hands for less than insightful comments. The TFs are not very helpful so it's mainly an independent course.</comment>This is an incredible class and a rare opportunity to learn a great deal about the basics of business and entrepreneurship. A must-take for anyone interested in business.</comment>Assignments are kind of random and not well explained, but every class is a ton of fun and the professors make it worth the effort.</comment>I loved this class! Every class was so dynamic and interesting, guest lecturers kept it alive and class participation ( which is an important part of the class) was enthusiastic and consistent. Keep up with course readings to be able to understand and contribute the most in each session. Thank you to the wonderful HBS staff for a great experience. Inspiring and I would love to take this class again!</comment>Hands down the best and my favorite class at Harvard. Case studies were relevant, professors were awesome. I actually did the work for this class - assignments and readings. It's totally doable. Each 10-12 page case study takes maybe 30 mins to 1.5 mins depending on how you slow you read and how much you effort you put into breaking the study down. Close and fast reading takes 45 mins max. That basic minimum per class will help you learn so much. It's a class worth taking. It will push you intellectually, realistically, and creatively.</comment>This class affords a very unique experience to undergraduates, as it's taught in HBS case study style. It really asks you to think critically about businesses and looking at them in ways you didn't before. If you're interested in entrepreneurship or business at all, I think it's a great class to take!</comment>Totally worth your time, even as an elective. The professors are amazing.</comment>Take this course! This course is extremely useful for all sorts of future ventures. It is very well-taught and a good introduction to the business school case method if you are interested in pursuing that path. Even if you are not that into finance or entrepreneurship, I still encourage you to take the class and to gain a deeper understanding about decision-making, finance, and the history of entrepreneurship.</comment>This is an excellent class that I encourage you to take. We read a case each class which covered a broad range of topics, from balance sheets to leadership to social entrepreneurship. Assignments pushed us to think critically and to put ourselves in the shoes of entrepreneurs, CEOs, grant-makers, and other powerful decision makers. The instructors and guest lecturers were all fabulous, and the teaching staff was very invested in the students.</comment>This class is fantastic, it'll help teach you a lot about entrepreneurship and the discussion format and professors are just awesome.</comment>This class taught me how businesses like Ryan Air and Zipcar work, which is super exciting. It also gave me an intro into finance. Take this course, even if you are not set on entrepreneurship (and are okay speaking in class discussions, because you need to participate at every class)!</comment>The case method is a fantastic way to learn - you will find yourself excited to go to class (and yes, even to prepare). Highly recommend for anyone interested in entrepreneurship or even business. Grading can feel a bit arbitrary (which can be stressful given how few assignments there are) but overall it's a very painless course that I really enjoyed taking.</comment>One of the coolest and best classes offered to Harvard undergrads - you would be a fool not to lottery for this.</comment>One of the best classes I've taken at Harvard!</comment>Great class! Mihir and David are fantastic, and you'll learn a lot pretty painlessly!</comment>This class is an exciting change of pace for undergrads. The teaching format is almost exclusively case discussions. Don't be afraid to be cold called.</comment>This course is one of the best and most practical courses at Harvard. You'll learn more about entrepreneurship than ever before. The professors (Professors Ager and Desai) are both amazing and truly invested in the course. All of the guest lecturers who come in always keep us excited!</comment>This course conveys crucial knowledge in order to manage a business in today's world.</comment>This class has changed my idea of what I want to do with life. The professors and guest lecturers are all passionate and engaging. This is the best class I've taken at Harvard. If you're on the fence about this class, take it. It is useful to anyone, no matter what you study.</comment>This class is awesome. You're rarely bored because each lecture is so different from the previous one, and so interactive. Assignments are really interesting, and challenging in the best way possible (writing up the case is a different type of skill, but it's not graded too harshly). The only thing is, don't take this class if you're really shy about speaking up, because that is definitely necessary for getting the full experience. Also don't be intimidated by the people who talk all the time, because eventually you'll see that they are really just blowing a lot of smoke. Definitely take this if you get lotteried in!</comment>For anyone with any interest in business whatsoever, this is the best class you'll be lucky enough to take at Harvard. Every lesson, like riding a unicorn, is its own unique magical experience that you'll tell your grandchildren one day. Half of the lectures end up being guest HBS professors coming and cramming in the best parts of their respective courses into your tiny unenlightened brain. The work load is ridiculously light - two classes a week with about 30 min to an hour of prep for each. Simultaneously the things you learn in this class are practical and invaluable in the world of consulting and business. Essentially, TAKE THIS CLASS.</comment>TAKE THIS CLASS EVEN IF YOU HAVE FULFILLED THE GEN ED. If you have any interest in entrepreneurship, you need to take this class. You will learn an insane amount. The business school case studies are terrific and a really engaging way to learn. The professors are incredible and outstanding--over the course of the semester you will be taught by 12+ of the top HBS professors. This class may also be the most practical class you take at Harvard. You'll do the same stuff that CEOs in training will in the executive education program, like a climbing Everest simulation. CEOs will come in to talk. TAKE THIS CLASS.</comment>You should absolutely take this class if you have any remote interest in entrepreneurship. I wouldn't say it necessarily changed my academic trajectory but it taught me many skills that are essential in the professional world, no matter what field.</comment>Teaches you about some of the common pathways for entrepreneurs through case studies. You'll learn how businesses come to be, how they get financed and how they scale. Very useful for anyone considering entrepreneurship. Best of all, the lectures are extremely engaging. But you have to talk in class a lot and you might get cold-called. If you get stage fright, try sitting in the front so you can't really see anyone else!

Overall, this was a great class. The professors will press you on you responses, but you'll learn a lot from them as well as your more experienced peers. A wonderful course-- I wish it could accommodate more students!

The biggest takeaway for me was to use preexisting resources as much as possible when creating a business!</comment>Take this class, but try to take another USW as well.  This course is a great introduction to entrepreneurial concepts and practices, but I don't feel like I learned much about the US as a whole, or the world for that matter.</comment>This class is amazing! This is a must-take class because it's something you can only take at Harvard. How often can you take a business school style class at HBS taught by actual HBS professors? The course covers seemingly every dimension of entrepreneurship, from strategy to venture capital to human capital management to self-awareness. The final project is also such a great learning experience -- although the experience depends on your project group, it can really be fulfilling and high-impact, since you're working on an actual business question for a company.</comment>I highly recommend this course!! Take it if you can (and keep entering the lottery if you can't!)</comment>I thought the course was quite good as a whole. However, it is unfortunate that a TF is always keeping a running tally of how many times each individual has spoken. This led to a number of vocal individuals speaking extremely often with comments of absolutely 0 substance. There were some fantastic cases (case of unidentified industries) and some silly cases (google project oxygen). As a whole the class was interesting. The class is a gen ed so don't expect this to be a course on how to found your own company.</comment>wonderfully perspective altering class!</comment>TAKE IT!!! Best class i have taken at Harvard. Introduces you to the world of business, entrepreneurship in a very practical way. Though the professors explicitly say this course in not an into to an MBA, I reckon it is. TAKE IT.</comment></course>ANTHRO 2660: The Anthropology of Knowledge: Seminar</title>The weekly presentation system is a little bit stressful and overwhelming. Be prepared. But you will get more out of this class than other classes.</comment>Read closely and carefully but keep the big picture in mind! Don't get lost in the details.</comment>An incredibly interesting topic; the materials and the discussion will not disappoint you. Prof. Herzfeld is a great resource.</comment>The discussions are very stimulating, with a focus on specialization in anthropology but relevant just for intellectual curiosity even if you are not an anthropologist. Herzfeld is a great thinker and critic, and is very supportive.</comment>It was one of the best experiences of my life! At first it was like jumping into the deep end of the pool without knowing how to swim...but somehow your survival instincts teaches you how to get smoother at moving through the water.</comment></course>WOMGEN 1200fh: Our Mothers, Ourselves: Postwar American Feminist Thought</title>If you have any interest in feminism, take it! and go to office hours, Prof. Jardine is great to talk with</comment>This is a great class! I highly recommend for many reasons. You cover a lot of different kinds of material, and get a good grasp of how feminist discourse has evolved.</comment>This class is awesome. The feminist literature you read is amazing and incredibly life-changing. Professor Jardine is a gem and her stories make your participation in class all the more worthwhile. I wish more class time was devoted to discussion and analysis of these works together as a class, because there is SO much interesting things to say and explore.</comment>DO THE READINGS! They're a lot of fun and it makes section / class so much more interesting.</comment>Take this course! Jardine is amazing, and you will also get to read some amazing writing every week. The history component of the course is great, and you will come out feeling inspired and learned.</comment>This is a fantastic class! Ari and Professor Jardine are amazing, and Professor Jardine especially has a connection to the feminist movement and the backlash against it that's amazing when you learn about it. Admittedly, the course has a lot of reading, but Ari and Prof Jardine are aware of this, and otherwise the coursework is light until the semester project. Discussions that I've listened to and participated in have been invaluable to me, as has been reading some of the canon of mainstream feminist thought. I wish there were some way to access all the semester projects that the people in the course do, but that's just me.</comment>This is a great class and I would highly recommend it to non-concentrators and to WGS secondaries or concentrators who need to fulfill the theory requirement. There is a ton of reading, but you really do cover a wide basis of thought.</comment>One of the best classes I've taken here. They say college is supposed to change how you think about the world, and this course definitely does that. Also much more of a personal, intimate feel than most Harvard courses, which can be refreshing during a semester of huge lecture classes.</comment>Everyone should have to take a class like this one. The class is a great introduction to feminist thought, with an emphasis on modern gender issues. Professor Jardine is a very interesting person and a great speaker. The classes always start out with a discussion of current events, followed by a lecture, then student presentations on the readings for the week, and finally a discussion. Participation is encouraged and the atmosphere is conducive to real conversation. The readings are pretty long, especially in the beginning; you get out of them what you put into them. Overall, a great class for ANYONE, not just WGS concentrators.</comment>A very general WGS course for anyone looking to take a class in the department. Professor Jardine is not that available but the readings are interesting. A lot of freedom for choosing your final project but not a lot of feedback if you are going in the right direction.</comment>This class was very disappointing. Some of the readings were interesting, but the class was poorly structured, and we spent lectures talking very broadly about American history and re-caping the readings rather than exploring them more in depth. I did not find Professor Jardine's lectures particularly insightful or illuminating. I would have gotten just as much out of reading all the books on the course syllabus on my own.</comment>The syllabus/reading list for this course is really amazing, and the section component allows for some really interesting discussions -- Ari was an awesome TF and brought complex, meaningful insights and questions into the discussions. However, the class is strangely organized. During each week, half the class reads one long book and the other half reads a different book. This means that discussion is all over the place and not very in depth. Professor Jardine is really impressive and knowledgeable, but the 2 hour "lecture/seminar" meeting part of the class is a bit fluffy, and about an hour of the two hours are filled up with student powerpoint presentations that aren't all that helpful or engaging, especially if you haven't read the book that they are presenting on. The course has potential, but it's not very substantive as it currently stands. I'm glad I read some classics though, and learned more about the first couple waves of feminism.</comment>It's a lot of reading, but well worth it.</comment>It is a good introduction to important texts in WGS. You need to be somewhat self-disciplined and really willing to engage with the material. Overall, a good class though.</comment>It's not too hard, just boring at times if you're not already well-versed in the issues covered. As a non WGS person, the course felt a little daunting even until the end.</comment>Everything about this course is amazing. Professor Jardine and Ari are wonderful people and teachers. Jardine has incredible personal stories to tell about her role in second wave feminism. The readings are engaging, and you come away from the class having learned a lot. The only outside assignments (besides reading) during the semester consist of response papers and a small presentation, neither of which require much work.</comment>This is an amazing course! Professor Jardine is incredible, do knowledgeable and approachable. You will learn a lot and have fun doing it. The reading is a bit much but the teaching staff know that and understand.</comment>Go at it with an open mind, and don't give in to the tyranny of majority in the discussions. Form your own opinions, and keep to them even if you can't share them.</comment></course>CHNSHIS 253: Topics in Late Imperial History</title>This course is effective in acquainting students with major trends in the historiography of late imperial China. Class discussions are stimulating, and the readings are mostly quite useful.</comment>While this class is challenging with a lot of work, if you put that work in you will receive an enormous return for your investment.</comment>This course is for generals prep. It requires you to learn about all the important topics and works in this field--of course it depends on how you define "important." The readings are mostly on social, economic, legal, institutional history.</comment>Be prepared for a massive amount of reading. The class itself is great, but the reading is crushing.</comment>This is a very time-consuming class. Students should be aware of this and plan their semester accordingly. I would discourage first-year grad students to take this class. The learning effect will be higher if you are advanced in your PhD studies.</comment></course>ENGLISH Cwar: Advanced Fiction: Workshop</title>Amazing, life-changing class.</comment>There is a lot of work involved in crafting a great story but the effort makes it so worth it.</comment>If you are serious about your fictional writing, take. this. class.</comment></course>SOCIOL 139: Economic Sociology: Global Perspectives</title>I think if Burak makes some changes to the course (like lecture having less class discussion, and the readings being more scholarly/sociological), then I would definitely recommend this class to future students. Burak is an amazing person, he is very approachable and kind, and clearly loves teaching. Also, you really get a chance to learn about the policies of other nations, such as the African countries, the Caribbean and China, which are often discussed in everyday conversations or in the news, but you might not otherwise learn about in an academic setting. If you want to know the "basics" then this is the course for you (but if you already an expert in the field of developmental economics or foreign affairs, this class may bore you!).</comment>This is a great course. Take it if you are interested in economics but want to gain a new perspective on the subject</comment>This course is a great way to engage in the "tension" (but really synergy!) between economics and sociology. The first half provides a useful foundation for economic sociology theory, and the second half delves into global applications. Prof. Eskici and Barbara care a lot about the students and did a great job - the course ran quite smoothly for its first year and is sure to get better the next time around! Take it to learn about a very cool field and apply your understanding to a global context!</comment>This class is a great way to explore the intersectionality of Economics and Sociology. It does a great job exposing students to the ways in which an understanding of culture and social institutions can impact economic behavior (and thus a more sociological understanding of economic behavior can be practical for economic students).</comment>The course is engaging with interesting readings and in course discussion. The teaching staff are very approachable and helpful. Be prepared for a lot of discussion around current examples.</comment>This course is very much a filler course. I wouldn't bother with it.</comment>Good class that provides a broad overview of different concepts of economic sociology. If you're interested in learning about the global economy from different perspectives, then take this class. Relatively painless as a soc class.</comment>This class is great. It really does what the course description says and is useful for economists and sociologists alike. Themes in the course are relevant to so many other themes and fields of studies including government, social studies, and environmental studies.</comment>great class</comment>Definitely speak up in class - it makes the course so much more interesting when others participate</comment></course>EXPOS 20.190: The Rise of China</title>In the end, this is a writing class; your grade will reflect how hard you tried to improve your conference draft, not how much you know about China.</comment>This class covers an interesting and pertinent topic. While the readings might be a little boring and tedious at times, the discussions more than make up for it and Sara is a wonderful preceptor. I would recommend this to anyone.</comment>The readings for this class were very interesting and I thought of China and China's rise in a different way than before. As for the actual writing component of the course, Sara does have high expectations for your quality of work, so you won't get away with a subpar paper. However, Sara is a very fair preceptor and very accessible if you want to talk to her about your ideas for your paper.</comment>Sara is a great expos teacher who will make you work to become a better writer. I do think she is a bit of a harder grader and gives more work than other expos teachers from my experiences talking with fellow classmates in other expos courses, but this course can be rewarding if you have any interest in China.</comment>This is probably one of the better expos classes, but only if you're willing to work for it. I actually think I put more work into this class than my other classes; however, I also got the most return from this class. The readings are interesting and the essay feedback is superb. If you do not know anything about China, this is an amazing class to take because you will probably find an interest in it. If you do know a lot about China, I do not think you will be bored; if anything, you will just be more able to write interesting essays.</comment>Rise of China was a pleasant class even though it was my last choice for Expos. However, I think those who really wanted to be in the class got more out of the material than I did.</comment>It's a great course. If you're interested in China at all, there's a lot of great content and topics that we cover. Granted that this is a writing course, our scope on China is limited but it's a great window in. You'll also learn about what makes good writing from this course. Sara in a phenomenal preceptor - she's incredibly accessible, gives great feedback, and really wants to see you succeed. (But she also has high expectations in terms of grading - bewarned!) All in all, solid expos. Great course.</comment>This is likely one of the harder Expos classes, so be warned. However, if you love China/social science, you will enjoy this class anyway (you end up doing a lot of social science actually). Take advantage of every opportunity to get help! Sara, the Writing Center, friends, etc.</comment>ALWAYS participate in class, go to office hours, and really look at your peers' and teacher's comments on your papers in this course! When you have conferences with your teacher or go to office hours, be sure to come in with questions. Try not to be too broad with the questions because then even the teacher might not know how to help you. Also, make use of the Writing Center! The people there are fabulous! Remember that everything you learn in this course is cumulative-- so just because in one unit you focus on structure and making use of counterargument, does not mean you can just forget about using evidence and close reading effectively from the previous unit!</comment>The Rise of China is an incredibly interesting and relevant expository writing topic, especially for those interested in the social sciences.</comment>It was a good class, but I think that if I hadn't gone to the writing center, my essays wouldn't have been okay with her help alone. You can do well in the class but I think that if you don't have some other outside help and you're not already a great writer, it might be a bit challenging to do well.</comment></course>GOV 1292: Politics in Brazil</title>Very good comparative government course on a country that I at least had overlooked until now. Professor Hagopian's lectures are quite good, and Jonathan Phillips is a top notch TF. The reading load is rather high, but other than that, I would highly recommend it.</comment>The class is very engaging and interesting.</comment>Take this class! You will not regret it!</comment>This is perhaps one of the best organized classes I've taken at Harvard. Professor Hagopian is a great lecturer and provides lecture outlines that introduce and conclude the main topics addressed. You need to go to lecture in order to appreciate the brilliance that is this class. Sections are also very effective at honing political science critical thinking skills. I came in with no background knowledge of government or political science and left feeling like I can effectively analyze what's going on in Brazilian politics and society today. If you're really in it to learn, office hours are a great and useful resource. Workload was normal, difficulty depends on how much you're invested in learning.</comment>Do not miss a single class. It is a privilege to attend a class with enjoyable lectures and well organized talking points. The organization of the lectures facilitated note taking and made it easy to follow. The lectures were packed with fascinating details. Professor Hagopian not only summarized all of the readings but also went in depth with details on her personal thoughts and interpretations of the data/findings, personal experience in Brazil and offered additional insight into her colleagues' perspectives as well. It is very clear that she cares a lot about the subject and in her students understanding and appreciate of it.</comment>This was a solid gov lecture course. Lectures were fairly interesting, section was well-run, the workload was decent...I think you get what you put into this class, and I found a lot of the students disengaged (maybe the result of having a big lecture course geared mainly towards upperclassmen). Nevertheless, if you're interested in Brazil and politics, it's a well organized course with some interesting subject material.</comment>This class is quite comprehensive, covering most key historical moments and current topics in Brazilian politics. However, I found the experience to be underwhelming. This may have been due to my experience in section, which was not particularly vibrant. The work is certainly manageable. So, I would say it's definitely worth taking if you have a particular interest in Brazil, but don't expect it to be a life-changing course.</comment>Really enjoyed the course. Definitely worth taking if you have any interest in Brazilian politics or you are just interested in comparative politics. Spend a good deal of time in the course discussing modern day issues</comment>This is the type of course where the readings are not too difficult or too many and lectures can be mostly interesting. If Jonathan is still the TF, his section seriously makes the course.</comment>Material can get confusing but broad concepts are very interesting.</comment>Very good class if you're interested in Brazil, not only in its politics. It may be somewhat repetitive if you already spent some time in the country, but the way the course is structured and the readings will help a lot in consolidating a more nuanced and sophisticated picture of the country.</comment></course>CHEM 163: Frontiers in Biophysics</title>In this course, you will be inspired of how basic physical and chemical studies can impact the frontier breakthroughs on biology. The class covers a wide range of topics pretty fast which might need a solid understanding of thermodynamics and statistics to catch up. But the materials wrote by Sunney can really give the student a sense of how a biological phenomena can be explained in terms of physical and chemical process. Sum up, This course suits graduate students who will be starting there research on biophysical of biochemical aspects very much but not recommended for undergrad unless one has a good understanding of physics and chemistry as well as a great enthusiasm on studying interdisciplinary field related to biology.</comment>Sunney is brilliant, but do not let his name and reputation in the scientific community convince you he is an adequate teacher.</comment>If you choose and learn this course, you will never regret at the end.</comment></course>STAT 104: Introduction to Quantitative Methods for Economics</title>It seems like a pretty generic Stat 101 -- other than using Stata and having a few classes about stocks (and, after all, who isn't going to be dealing with stocks in their lifetime?), I think that this course is good for anyone who wants to know Statistics, whether its for an economics degree or not.</comment>Go to section.</comment>Very fun class. Not too difficult. You definitely don't have to go to lecture (you can learn everything from the coursepack), but lectures are pretty fun and you probably should go.</comment>This is a well-organized, efficient course.</comment>DEFINITELY harder than past years. Expect the exams to be harder (at the rate Parzen is going). I don't know how other EMRs are, but you'll need to study a bit for it and put some work in the p sets.</comment>Stat104 is an easy class on a week to week basis. You don't necessarily have to go to lecture in order to understand all of the material, and though the psets sometimes can take time, they're not too difficult. The only thing is that the tests get a little weird on you. Even though you know the material and you can have note sheets, sometimes there's not enough time to finish them or there are weird questions and the tests are much harder than expected.</comment>this really ain't your grandpa stat 104</comment>It is pretty easy and straight forward. Parzen is funny and his lectures really make sense. Great to full the EMR gen ed or to get a stats requirement out of the way for a concentration. Not a huge workload and the problem sets are so straight forward that they are almost fun.</comment>Learn the things, low work, funny ish lectures. Watch them at home 1.6x</comment>This is an easy course for a good introduction to statistics. Parzen is a great lecturer, and keeps everyone engaged. Overall good class, with a relatively light work load.</comment>Very clear structure</comment>A solid class to take, definitely recommend it as a means to understanding statistical analysis.</comment>While an easy course, it is equally engaging.</comment>Definitely got harder than previous iterations since I've shopped it before. But it's actually a fairly useful course giving a great intro into probability and inference. Don't expect to understand the mathematics behind everything yet, but stat 104 actually give you a pretty solid foundation and birds-eye overview that will help you understand things once you take later stat courses.</comment>Interesting class, great professor, exams proved to be very difficult.</comment>this course is very straightforward and organized. the problems are predictable, and as long as you put in minimal effort (complete the psets, skim over the lecture slides), you will do well.</comment>If you've taken AP Stats, this class may be repetitive and boring. However, the only interesting part is its application to economics. Psets are sometimes long and tedious but not very difficult.</comment>This class is nothing to be afraid of.  Parzen is hilarious, the lectures are engaging and, if you for some reason are unable to be at them or fail to pay attention, the lecture slides teach you basically everything you need to know.</comment>Stat 104 is NOT as easy as previous years, the problem sets are not necessarily difficult but are very time consuming, the final project takes some effort, the means for exams are not particularly high, i.e. the class is not a cake walk, you need to put work into it. go to section!</comment>Parzen is a great lecturer! Take this class if you want an engaging introduction to statistics.</comment>great course! easy and delightful</comment>It is imperative to do the HW in a timely fashion or you will be scrambling to finish. The material isn't terribly difficult if you go to class and ask questions when you have them.</comment>This class is not too taxing and teaches you some really important and applicable ideas.</comment>The professor is awesome and engaging, and I definitely felt like the work level was manageable.</comment>attend class</comment>If you study and do lots of practice problems, it will be easy. Straightforward but requires some work. 

Warning - lectures can be a waste of time, since Parzen tends to go off topic a lot.</comment>A good empirical reasoning course and very good introductory course to statistics.</comment>Stat 104 provides a pretty solid base in statistics with introductions to many major topics. The material is fun and is constantly being applied to real life scenarios—there is very little theory. I have never taken a statistics course so it was perfect for me, but if you have, or are looking to really push yourself, 110 might be more fitting. If you are looking to learn stat, work to succeed, and have a good time, there is no better course than stat 104.</comment>Stat 104 is so useful and Parzen is a great professor. Enzo's sections are fantastic.</comment>There are weekly psets, a regression project, and a final. None of the work is too bad, but buy the lecture notes because they are helpful.</comment>Good class, useful, not too challenging. Definitely go to Parzen's office hours instead of the TFs.</comment>This is a great class to take, whether you need it for your concentration, Gen Ed, or elective. You will learn a great deal from Professor Parzen, who is funny and engaging. In addition, the grading in this course is very fair.</comment>The course head and TFs definitely give you the necessary resources to be successful in this class, if you put in the work.</comment>It provides a good foundation for statistics. It is a good course because you gain the following three:
1. Applicable sets of statistical skills
2. Knowledge of STATA
3. The ability to read long questions and power through seemingly long psets.</comment>It's an interesting and pretty easy course.</comment>This is a very great course to get a pre-med requirement done.</comment>I loved this course. As long as you do your problem sets and attend lecture and section, you will be fine. I really enjoyed this course and my performance in the class.</comment>This is such a great course that I think should be necessary for everyone -- it's an interesting first look for those less technical how information can be misconstrued. It also, on the flipside, shows how powerful statistics can be in estimations and providing guesses of things you never thought you would be able to guess. The class is very well -- and humorously -- taught, and there are SO many resources in this class that it makes classes like CS50 seem like a barren wasteland.</comment>Its an enjoyable class and it gives you a sound introduction to statistics.</comment>Especially for an intro-level course, Stat 104 was tremendously well run. Lectures were interesting and fun, and the fact that they were taped was also an added bonus; sections were well run; and P-sets and Exams were fair and returned amazingly quickly. 

The only reservation I can note is that, if you took AP Stat in high school, upwards of 75% of it is essentially the exact same thing and just review (it goes a little bit more in depth with stuff and covers a lot more regressions, but that's about it for the differences). I took AP Stat before, so this course was quite easy and I unfortunately ended up taking away very little new knowledge from it. This isn't a fault of the course -- it is an intro class, after all -- but it is something to be aware of.

So, if you didn't take AP Stat, TAKE THIS COURSE. It's fun, it's interesting, it isn't too difficult, and it teaching important information. If you did take AP Stat, it's still a fun class to take, but only do so with the understanding that you probably won't take much away from it.</comment>Do not leave the problem sets until the last minute. Try to do at least three problems a day.</comment>It's a great course (mainly due to the awesome professor) and is an easy way to substitute for the Math requirement!</comment>This class is a very doable class that teaches the basics of statistics well. The workload is very manageable and the lecture are pretty funny but at the same time informative. Michael Parzen does a good job of explaining the concepts.</comment>make use of all the help available to you</comment>Very straightforward and well organized class. If you are interested in majoring in statistics, this is a very good introduction and you learn a lot of foundation to hypothesis testing.</comment>If you're an economics concentrator or otherwise want to go into finance or consulting, take this class. It will teach you exactly what you need to know about statistics for those fields and pretty much no other fields. Parzen's lectures are a blast, but they don't really help you understand the material. Working on p-sets was the most annoying thing. Each had 15+ questions, with a lot of the questions being basically clones of each other. For the first time in college, I felt like I was doing busy work.</comment>Great class! Very interesting and very helpful TFs</comment>Stay up to date with the psets and watch the lectures on 1.5x speed.</comment>You'll learn useful skills to use with Stata statistical software. The class will be especially practical for you if you're interested in doing finance work.</comment>Must take course for those with no stats background</comment>If you need help, go to section and office hours!</comment>This class is a good introduction to statistics. Prof. Parzen is very funny and tries to make entertaining lectures. The course is quite easy, but the problem sets are a lot of work and can get annoying.</comment>Great introductory stat course</comment>Good course, Parzen is probably one of the best teachers at harvard. I have some complaints though. First learning is seriously compromised not working in groups on the final project since we dont learn anything then. In a group you learn from everyone in your group, alone you just do what you already know... Second complaint: the homeworks take forever and dont need to be that brutally long.</comment></comment>This class is a great introduction to statistics. As long as you watch/attend the lectures and go to section, the class is very manageable and enjoyable.</comment>You cover a lot of statistical methods in a fast time but it's very manageable. It's not too difficult a class; the psets are long but very straightforward, and the midterms aren't awful. It's a good way to get your math requirement out of the way while learning relevant information.</comment>This course is a walk in the park as long as you attend lecture and take good notes. Beware the final regression project, however; it really needs to be done over the course of multiple days.</comment>This is a fair class. If you need it for a Stat requirement, I would take it. Going to section is incredibly helpful for the pset.</comment>Pretty chill course. I have never taken a stats course before, so everything was new to me. I thought Parzen was funny but he seemed to rush through the lectures. Until I found out that if I just read the slides and watched the lectures online (being able to pause and understand the concepts before he rushes on) I was able to get around full points for all my psets. Make sure you find out how you do well in the class early on in the semester.</comment>It's pretty painless</comment>know your regression</comment>It is a demanding course but very rewarding.</comment>Pay attention, put the necessary work in, and you'll have a blast</comment>Go to lecture!</comment>It is a pretty easy class. Plus, the skills that you learn are very applicable to the real world where analyzing data is very important. Also, it gives a pretty decent intro into stata which is a program used a lot in the finance industry.</comment>Prepare yourself for the second exam. Overall, a manageable and practical course.</comment>Best class I've taken at Harvard</comment>I thought this class was really interesting, especially the parts about probability. It helped me think about everyday things differently.</comment>Parzen is an awesome professor but the class is relatively difficult.</comment>Parzen is great, class is great, so many resources. I really ended up liking stat and will continue. I highly recommend it.</comment>pretty clutch</comment>This is a great intro course into statistics and provides quantitative skills necessary to do good research and to understand economics (or similar social science disciplines).</comment>I don't think there is a *great* intro to stats class at Harvard, so this may be your best bet. Parzen is an engaging lecturer and isn't evil in his expectations of you. Still, though, this wasn't an extremely pleasant way to spend my time (as someone with very little interest in stats but a concentration requirement to fulfill). I would recommend watching the lecture videos and reading over the notes at minimum; also, do your psets. I would say it is possible to do very well in this class with a moderate amount of effort, and passably with a very small amount.</comment>This class is very straightfoward and as long as you attend lecture (or watch them online) you should be fine. Do not underestimate the time it takes to do the final project though, and make use of the resources available--i.e. the plenty of TFs, Study Networks, and Parzen's Skype office hours.</comment>good class, moderate work load, helpful skills</comment>I would probably recommend this to someone who is looking for a manageable or easy class to fulfill a concentration requirement or gen ed.</comment>Watch the lectures, do the homework. Memorization is a good skill to have. Parzen is really funny so lecture is not boring even though the material can be really dry.</comment>Take Stat before. It's super interesting, but incredibly difficult if you don't have a mind that understands Statistics.</comment>I loved this class, you should definitely take it if you have any interest at all in statistics. I chose this over the other statistics class, and would choose it again just for Parzen's funny lectures and great sense of humor. He is also very helpful and accessible outside the classroom--even on Skype the night before exams!</comment>take it</comment>Stay on top of work!</comment>Not as easy as you've heard, especially if you haven't taken stats before.  Parzen is a bro</comment>Really hard, especially for students with no statistics background. The tests were significantly harder than the practice exams (past tests). Section is super helpful.</comment>If you're an Econ concentrator you need this or stat 100 and this one is more comprehensive and interesting (so Ive heard). Beyond having to take it as a concentration requirement, I really enjoyed this class and found it really interesting</comment>Do your work; go or watch EVERY lecture! It' imperative. Do the practice tests and you should be fine. It's a straightforward course.</comment>very easy</comment>It's a great introductory course! A little misleading because the class is much easier for those who have taken a statistics class in high school yet it is still doable.</comment>take if you must--you will be fine</comment>I would probably recommend this course because I learned a lot and the professor gave interesting lectures.</comment>Amazing class. Take it!!!</comment>Go see Professor Parzen! He's really cool and can help you a lot! Don't be intimidated!</comment>For students with no previous statistics background, this course provides a wide-sweeping introduction to statistics in an interesting and comprehensive way. Professor Parzen keeps the material exciting.</comment>Not too difficult, but also have to learn all material on your own.</comment>Good course, solid introduction to statistics. Not the most unique or fascinating course but the knowledge is good to have. Very much routes students into finance or consulting</comment>Take this class if you can follow lecture slides as another might follow a textbook.</comment>Psets are very manageable. Midterms were fair, but the final was definitely a lot harder than I expected. Parzen is hilarious, so I think he is worth actually going to lecture to listen to, but the online recordings are awesome for whenever you miss a class (just stay caught up!). Overall not too stressful of a course and not too much time committment.</comment>Go to office hours/study networks if you need help</comment>I learned a lot in this course but it is important to navigate the resources properly (i.e. finding the right section leader for you).</comment>Parzen's one of the nicest, funniest professors I've had. His lectures are entertaining, which is especially appreciated given the admittedly often dry material. While the material isn't difficult to understand, you can't underestimate it—not taking the homeworks and midterms (really the only two parts of the class you are obliged to focus on) seriously will come back to bite you, and badly.</comment>I really enjoyed Parzen's lectures, and the material is very straightforward. What's expected of you on assignments and exams is very clear, so it's clear how to do well in this course.</comment>Professor Parzen is the best! Take this course!</comment>n</comment>If you don't enjoy statistics, then don't take it or else you'll be bored out of your mind. Otherwise, it's a fine introduction to statistics.</comment>Take this class if you're a sophomore taking orgo and looking to take a dub to balance out that L in orgo</comment>Lectures and section were completely unnecessary. Honestly, I did this entire course by just looking over the lecture slides weekly to tell me how to do the homework. Parzen basically read off the lecture slides with some annotations (that you could find on the lecture recording anyway). And if you were ever unclear, you could just watch that small part of the lecture.</comment>That you really don't need to go to any classes. With the formulas on the cheatsheets that are allowed for each exam, you can just used the formulas.</comment>The class is a good amount of work and is a good introduction to stats for econ majors.  If you do your work in the class, and go to the lectures, you will get an OK grade.</comment>Go to lecture. Parzen is fun to listen to.</comment>This a great introduction to statistics. I have heard that there is a lot of overlap with high school statistics classes (especially AP Stat), but as someone who had never taken a stat class, I found it extremely useful. Professor Parzen is a great lecturer, who is really funny and always keeps things interesting, so you should really go to lecture (even though they are all online). Sections are optional, but I would definitely go, because I found them extremely useful. There are so many resources (use the Study Network!!) that this class really isn't that difficult, and I felt like I finished it, having learned a ton of new skills. I definitely recommend taking this class if you've never taken a statistics class before.</comment>it doesn't take much time. watch the lectures online in 2X speed and take notes. find a good section leader. those things make the difference- actually paying attention to the lecture and having a good TF</comment>This class is not the most exciting one you'll take, but is useful if you need to know stat.</comment>Professor Parzen is great. He's on the student's side when it comes to teaching us and preparing us for tests. He's clear about what he wants us to know, and he purposefully avoids "tricking" us. For example, he lets us bring in cheatsheets for the tests, and he says things like, I just want to know what you know. He is student-oriented in other ways, too - he's funny, well-organized, and the notes are clearly formatted to be as clear as possible. Everything in lecture was directly relevant to homework, tests, and career opportunities, and he even included real-world, fun applications of statistics.</comment>This course is an easy way to satisfy EMR and the stats requirements for Gov and Social Studies, especially if you have taken AP Statistics. If you're really into statistics, take a higher-level course. Parzen gives informative lectures (although some would say otherwise) and he always makes himself accessible to homework and test questions.</comment>If you think you'd like statistics, try it out. Simple enough.</comment>If statistics does not come naturally to you, get ready to put in a lot of work. Parzen presents the course as easy, and for some students it is. However, problem sets can takes 6-8 hours if you want a good grade on them, and the midterms were not easy. Final was pretty easy.</comment>Stat 104 has definitely gotten harder over the past few years.  I got a 5 on the AP and I can't really say that it helped me at all.  The psets in the beginning and end were reasonable, but some in the middle were ridiculous.  The midterms were not too difficult, but you were pretty pressed for time.  I'd say only take this class if you need to, otherwise you've just found yourself a bunch of busy work for the semester.</comment>Go to section. Give yourself enough time to study; the material really isn't that hard.</comment>Watch the lectures online, but actually watch them. The material is easy to keep up with if you watch the lectures, but its hard to teach yourself if you fall behind on the videos. Also, Parzen is a great lecturer so they aren't impossible to get through.</comment>This course really teaches you things you can actually use in life. Everyone should have some statistical knowledge, so if you haven´t done any course in statistics already, you should take it. Parzen is a great professor and I really recommend to go to his lecture. He is really funny and it is easy to listen to him. The problem sets are not that difficult but they are not very short and take some time. I really enjoyed this class!</comment>Stay on top of coursework!</comment>Work hard</comment>TAKE THIS CLASS. It is one of the few that is completely manageable and teaches you a lot about the subject, professor is amazing, material is easy to understand.</comment>This class was a great way to get a basic grasp of statistics, as well as flex my quantitative muscles a bit. It was exciting to acquire a skill set with which to parse data and interpret numbers. I also enjoyed the pace of the class-the p-sets were long but helpful and the exams were well-timed for the amounts we had learned.</comment>All lectures are videotaped. This is a good thing because, while Parzen is a good lecturer, he talks slowly and also get distracted. You can watch lectures on 1.5 speed and it is great. Psets are time consuming but doable.</comment>Great introduction to Stata! Do the homework, review the textbook, & you'll get a good grade.</comment>I highly recommend this course. It is not the easy, do nothing course that it once was. But with a little bit of effort I believe that everyone can do well and learn a lot.</comment>This is a great course if you've taken AP Statistics in high school and you want an easy course to balance out your schedule!!! Most of it was the same as AP stat, except for material after the second midterm, but it was really easy to understand nevertheless. Parzen is a character, he gives hilarious lectures, but still manages to be on-point with giving the information you need, along with lots of cool extra social/consumer/business facts/information. In addition, the class is very accommodating! Sections are optional and pretty unnecessary, as they just reiterate simple concepts from lecture. You don't even need to go to your assigned TF, you can go to any section or none at all. There's no textbook, all lecture slides and videos are available online, tons of previous exams for practice, and Parzen even has skype sessions if you have questions. It's a great class. Only, the end-of-year project was a bit of a time suck and kind of hard. So set some time away for that!</comment>You will love lectures because Parzen is hilarious, and it isn't really easy but you finish the semester feeling like you actually learned a lot</comment>do the psets and go to section</comment>It is definitely a good class to take if you have never taken a statistics class at all but it is harder than most people make it out to be and also if you do have some knowledge of statistics, it may be worth it to just take an upper level statistics class, particularly if an upper stat class is a part of your concentration requirements.</comment>Great into to stat. I was afraid to go into 110 without any clue about what stat was so I'm happy I took it. Not much work and taught by a super funny professor.</comment>TAKE THIS CLASS! This is a very engaging class. The real life applications make lecture interesting each day. 
PROS:
1. You can watch all lectures online (use 1.5x speed so they go faster)
2. Section is optional
3. Cheat sheets on tests
4. Parzen is a boss
5. Lenient curve
6. Essentially the only three times you need to go to class are the 3 test days

Cons
1. First Pset is a pest but they get easier afterwards
2. The final project is very tedious (but extremely interesting for some)</comment>A good class, but don't underestimate it. TAKE THIS CLASS INSTEAD OF ANY BIOLOGY STATISTICS SORT OF CLASS. Parzen is a great professor.</comment>The class is fun, Professor Parzen really cares about you, and section's are optional. I'd suggest you take it if you like Stat and Ec.</comment>It is the only class that I actually enjoyed going to lecture. Professor Parzen is incredible!</comment>Very good intro stat course.</comment>You know the drill. Easy class, but tedious problem sets. The second midterm this year was unexpectedly hard lol, but the curve MORE than made up for it.</comment>Surprisingly loved this class. Prof. Parzen is the homie. Yes, I actually went to lecture and enjoyed it. Stat is nice because it has more practical applications than other math classes.</comment>This class requires you go to class and do your problem sets. If you're diligent up front, the midterms and final will be a breeze. Nothing is too difficult conceptually, just requires you show up and listen.</comment>Psets are quite challenging.</comment>I really enjoyed Mr. Parzen's lectures. They were both hilarious and worth watching as they covered the material well. Even though I missed one or two lectures, I was able to catch up easily. The workload is completely manageable and you just need to be efficient with your time!</comment>It is a very easy class - Parzen really hands you any information you need to know in 10 different formats.</comment>Great course and very useful</comment>Do not treat this as an easy side-class. Put in effort and you will be fine. Go to lectures and buy the course pack, and you will almost definitely get a great grade.</comment>The professor is the best, actually go to/listen to lectures. Also if you fall behind on something just talk to someone because they really would rather you do well.</comment>Parzen is pretty funny, but it can be hard to learn the material necessary for psets/exams from lecture. Sections are super helpful if you find a good TF.</comment>Parzen is so worth it! He's really funny and he is great at explaining the concepts. Everyone is really accessible so there is always someone there when you need help. All of the lectures are video recorded making everything really convenient. Overall, I learned so much from this class and I really enjoyed it!</comment>It's a very good course</comment>Low workload, very manageable.</comment>Know the material very well. Over-prepare</comment>Parzen is great! Super interesting course, workload is very manageable!</comment></course>FOLKMYTH 114: Embodied Expression/Expressive Body: Dance in Cultural Context</title>TAKE IT. Not the class to take if you're trying to get an easy A. But so the class to take if you're trying to dedicate your time to working hard to engage with something super cool and fascinating. The class has many assignments, so you continue to be pushed to think carefully, critically, and creatively. Deborah Foster in general has a marvelous energy. There are dance workshops almost every week, and chocolate covered things that fostered a lovely environment. It could be a year long. There's so much amazing material to cover!! Also go to office hours!!! She's so cool and it's nice to get to chat close up.</comment>An amazing interdisciplinary course with one of the greatest teachers at Harvard.</comment>This class is so much fun, Deborah Foster is incredible, the discussions are great, you will interact with your classmates more than in most classes, and you will get to spend some of your week moving.</comment>This has been one of my favorite courses at Harvard! Dr. Foster and Mila are awesome, highly-knowledgeable instructors! We had wonderful class discussions that treated the intersection of dance and culture. The ethnographical project was such a rewarding process. The class workshops are incredible and an amazing opportunity. You should be aware, there is an application process because this class is so popular. This year, over 100 students wanted to take the class, and it is limited around 23.</comment>Intelligent discussions, very fun dance workshops, and Prof. Foster is a deeply intelligent scholar who also cares genuinely about your thoughts (and your lives!)</comment>This is a wonderful course. The workshops are a blast and Professor Foster is kind, thoughtful, and enthusiastic.

I think dance is an under-appreciated aspect of our culture (in academic settings, at least). The opportunity to study dance was enlightening because I have had so many experiences with dance but never studied it.</comment>It's really a fun class. Dance workshops are awesome! Mile is really cool too</comment>If you are even remotely interested in dance and are lucky enough to get a spot in this course, definitely take it!  Dr. Foster is an excellent lecture and classes were always enjoyable and interactive.</comment>This course is incredibly engaging! You will learn how to critically examine movement in many different aspects of your life and will develop a dialogue for discussing the ephemeral. This was my favorite course of the semester! It is a lot of fun to dance weekly and you will understand yourself differently!</comment>This is by far one of the best courses offered. It will change your life for the better and introduce you to both yourself and a group of fascinating, supportive people.</comment>Professor Foster is a caring, thoughtful, passionate teacher. This class could change your life. Incredible to come into contact with so much dance, to see how vastly different one form of dance can be from another, and to learn to look at movement and bodies with careful eyes.</comment>This is the best class that I've taken at Harvard thus far. It is physically active, intellectually stimulating, and all-around fantastic. Professor Foster has truly constructed a unique course with workshops and deep class discussions in an intimate yet diverse setting.</comment>This is an amazing class. If you get the chance to take it, definitely do it. You will learn more than you imagine you could while having a ton of fun doing it - take advantage of the resources of this class and take it seriously!</comment>If you have a genuine interest in the field of dance, take this course. Do not take this course if you want an easy Gen Ed. This course will NOT be easy and a light load for you if you do not really enjoy the subject matter. Luckily for me, I have a deep interest in dance for many reasons, and found this course inspiring and eye-opening. Dr. Foster is an amazing person, and I feel lucky to have found a professor who actually cares about her students at Harvard. She fosters a warm, friendly environment and understands that the varying backgrounds of students can actually greatly enrich the classroom experience.</comment>The class was so much fun.</comment>Fantastic course! Deborah Foster is an engaging professor, but more importantly a spectacular person who really takes the time to know the class. This is a pretty laid back course, but you'll only get a lot out of it if you put the thought into it!</comment>If you are interested in dance, this course makes you love it. The texts are very well chosen, the workshops (practice sessions) are a lot of fun and provide valuable kinesthetic experience that adds an important layer to the learning experience, and Professor Foster is a great instructor with a lot of enthusiasm for dance.</comment></course>ENG-SCI 289: Innovation and National Security</title>This was a very interesting class. The subject matter is unique, and the experience of collaborating with students from very different fields was enriching. I would recommend it to students with initiative and a willingness to step outside your comfort zone into a new reference frame. The assignments are done as large groups, so be willing to work hard, support your teammates, and think outside the box.</comment>my reservations being, don't expect it to be a course you "take"... this is one you "do." So... if you're looking for a course to sit back and listen, maybe write a paper or whatever, this one's not for you.</comment></course>SYSTBIO 212: Communication of Science</title>Take assignments seriously but don't take yourself too seriously. If you want to try a new presentation style, go ahead an try it out. There are very few times in your life where you will be giving presentations in such a supportive (and non-judgmental environment).</comment>It is an amazing opportunity not only to improve your communication skills and awareness of how to recognize and prepare effective communications strategies but also to get to know 3 amazing faculty member of the program and your classmates.</comment></course>HAA 273m: Drawing Operations from Fauvism to the Cut-Outs: Henri Matisse</title>The class focuses on Matisse's cut-outs, but by way of this central topic touches on a number of other issues central to modern European art. It can be taken by someone without prior study of Matisse. That said, you should be ready to learn a lot about Matisse and should have an interest in him.</comment>Very challenging, but equally rewarding. A wonderful experience if one work's hard throughout semester.</comment>Professor Gough is a gem professor. She is incredibly charismatic, intelligent, and more importantly, she cares deeply about her students. I was lucky to take this class with her. Learning about Matisse with her was truly once in a lifetime experience--it's obvious that she is passionate about Matisse, and it really comes through in the discussions. She did an amazing job guiding us through conversations, holding workshops, and setting up excursions. She also focuses a lot on how to write a good paper, which is one of the most important things about the concentration.</comment></course>MCB 80: Neurobiology of Behavior</title>I took this because I think neurobiology is interesting and it's required for mind/brain/behavior. Although I didn't have a negative experience with the class because it wasn't very much work, most of the lectures and materials aren't very engaging and I wouldn't take it unless required.</comment>This is a good course, but definitely not a walk in the park. I think the material is very interesting but the course often goes way too in depth and can be overwhelming. Take this course if you are willing to put the time into it (studying for weekly quizzes etc.).</comment>This is the worst class I've taken at Harvard. Couldn't take anything out of it. I wanted to be a neurobio concentrator, but this class, along with other factors, convinced me that I shouldn't. I enjoyed both LPSA and LS1b, but this was just horrible</comment>If you are taking this course as a concentration elective or general elective, recognize that this class is quite detail-oriented and catered toward pre-concentrators.</comment>If you're not a bio person, be prepared to catch up.</comment>Midterm and final is difficult, prepare yourself. But sections are nice. Lectures are interesting.</comment>I personally did not have any strong feelings for this course, but from a completely objective perspective, this course is one of the worst courses that I've taken at Harvard. 

First of all, the lectures do not generate much enthusiasm for the material. Neurobiology is a very interesting and relevant field today, but the fact that they can generate little enthusiasm about such interesting material really says something about the class. 

Secondly, the teaching staff is the least helpful teaching staff that I have encountered so far. I don't think I remember the lecturers ever opening up office hours once for students. My TF also didn't hold any office hours either, only skype/call sessions. I don't think there were many extra office hours/review sections that were held by the TF's to prepare for the midterm and final as well, or if there were, they were definitely not publicized well enough for people to know about. 

Additionally, sections were completely useless. The way it was structured is the TF just stood there, waiting for students to ask questions, and if there were no questions, then section was dismissed early. This way of structuring is not conducive at all to learning - a better way to have structured the section is to actually have material prepared, go over what was learned in lecture that week, and since this will help students remember concepts that they didn't remember well, then they'll be able to ask relevant questions that will help them clarify concepts. Section handouts with diagrams and explanations would also be very useful for elucidating concepts as well. Also, there were so many difficult concepts, like the higher visual system and occular dominance, that we simply did not go over in lecture at all. Rather than doing pointless labs that don't teach anything about the concepts, it'd be more useful to use that time to go over these additional concepts.

Also, assignments were almost completely useless. Both the two problem sets about reading research papers and also the term papers were completely useless. They should have instead given more problem sets that helped students understand some of the more difficult concepts in later lectures.

Also, the lecture notes online were not very well written and didn't explain concepts nearly as thoroughly as they could have. They should add extra annotations to the notes and actually describe what pictures/diagrams mean to clearly express and describe ideas, since the notes were oftentimes very unclear and vague.

The midterm was also poorly written, with questions that were oftentimes super vague. The problem sets and lectures did not sufficiently prepare us for the midterm as well.

The one plus side about this course is that it's very chill in terms of course load. The course needs to be a little more rigorous, however, if the students actually want to learn something from this class.</comment>This class covers some basic topics, as well as some interesting applications and implications for current and future work.  The material itself is very interesting if you pay attention, though assignments are not very inspiring.  Not a bad requirement for an introduction to neurobio, especially because the TFs are great and help pad some of the barer parts of the syllabus.</comment>The material is very interesting, low workload. Really recommend this class you'll be impressed with the way your brain works.</comment>solid</comment>This is a really interesting class but can be a bit disorganized at times.</comment>MCB80 was lifechanging. The material was awesome and I learned so much, but the lectures were kind of long and sometimes lost your interest. The midterm was really hard, but the final was fair. A great chance to get a lot out of a cool, cutting edge field-- if you paid attention during the semester.</comment>Be prepared to spend lots of time memorizing! No way around that given the type of material taught in this class</comment>One of the funnest classes I've taken her at Harvard. Material is interesting and professors were very enthousiastic about their own course.</comment>After each lecture, go through and read your notes and take down any questions you have so they can be addressed in section. Section is infinitely useful for clarifying ideas about lecture (if you have Jenelle, who is AMAZING). Also, going through the questions for each lecture and making sure that you can answer them is critical to doing well on the final.

Pick a group of smart and motivated people to do the midterm with. The midterm is mostly open questions and requires some thinking and debate to succeed on. 

In general this class was very interesting and made me realized that neurobiology can be applied on many different levels that are relevant not only to disease and psychology but also to art and perception.</comment>It's a laid back intro to neuroscience and you have to take it to take all the really interesting upper-level psych/neuro combo classes, so take it.</comment>Don't fall behind on the material.</comment>The material is fascinating, but lectures are slow paced. The workload is very manageable, and quizzes keep you up to speed with the material.</comment>I absolutely loved this course. They gave us a lot of information about cells, systems, and humanity in general, but it wasn't necessarily hard to memorize since it's all so relevant to our survival. The assignments were totally manageable, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested in the brain.</comment>This course is poorly designed, but you will learn a great deal about Neurobiology.</comment>MCB80 goes over fascinating material, so if you are at all interested in the brain then I recommend it. Although the way the course was run frustrated me a bit at times, I thought that the class was definitely worthwhile. In particular, the second half of the course is really cool because you start talking about things like language and individuality. Since it is a survey course, though, there is a ton of material and the final is very memorization-based, so be prepared for that.</comment>Take this class if you have any interest in neurobiology and want to dip your feet into the field during your time at Harvard. Although I am not a neurobiology concentrator, I wanted to have a baseline knowledge about key neuroscience concepts, and this class definitely delivered. However, do realize that the class can be a bit tedious at times, so don't expect an easy grade. It requires real work and real interest, otherwise you will not enjoy this class.</comment>You'll learn a lot about the foundations of neuroscience in this course! Lichtman and Sanes are great lecturers and great people in general.</comment>This class is very interesting. All the assignments are very different, so it does not get too boring. The midterm was very different from the final, but used all part of knowledge that was presented. The midterm was difficult as it required us to present things that we were never taught. Other than that, fine class.</comment>Difficult, in a weird way. Not much busy work, though. Really comes together in the end.</comment>A lot of interesting material covered. Would definitely recommend this course to people interested about the nervous system and what makes us human. Lichtman and Sanes are incredible professors and they try to make lecture as interesting as possible. Problem sets don't take much time, and the writing assignments will help you grow as a science writer.</comment>This course will teach you great material. It is interesting to know how your nervous system works and how we have come to know what we know in this area. The brain really is a very interesting thing and it is amazing how much we DON'T know about it. Take this class and you will soon be able to understand most of the research going on in neuroscience even though this is just an intro course. 

Because this is a survey course, beware of the boat-load of material you will be expected to memorize. I suggest setting up 2 hrs every week to go over lectures and discussion questions throughout the semester. I was lucky enough to have 4 days at the end to study for the final but most people don't have this luxury so you will have to keep up with the course. With that said, I really dislike the approach the class has towards memorizing. The midterm is take-home so you are actually dealing with the larger concepts/thinking critically as a scientist to design experiments and come up with explanations for observed phenomena. But the final is mostly about how much you can commit to memory. If the class wants to take the latter approach, then it should really have 3 quizzes throughout the semester so you are forced to keep up with the material. Or the final should be integrative like the midterm.

All that said, take this class before you graduate so that you know how your body works and somewhat of the brain, as well. You might get to know yourself better as is true with a lot of the Mind, Brain, and Behavior courses at Harvard.</comment>Moderately difficult but doable. It's a good idea to keep up with the material in the class (because it's not hard to understand it's just a lot). I loved the material but thought the class could have been better organized.</comment>I enjoyed MCB80, particularly some of the later lectures that got into more interesting topics like memory, mental illness, and language. There is a wide range of assignments, including a handful of psets at the beginning and two "term papers" (short review papers about an assigned article) later on. The midterm is take-home and you can work in groups, but it ended up being a lot harder (and more stressful) than expected. Many of the questions were worded confusingly and were heavily focused on just a few lectures. When I spoke with teaching staff after receiving my grade it was clear that there was no set rubric for grading the test--they basically curve the grades for each question based around the best answers that they get, so it's easy to lose a lot of points if you don't include every detail. That being said, I enjoyed the course and feel like it's a great introduction for anyone interested in neurobiology.</comment>Get a good TF.  If the TF doesn't bring anything extra to the lectures, switch immediately.  Also, study for the midterm.  It may seem odd to do so for a take home exam, but it will make the midterm go so much more quickly.  If you do the discussion questions with each lecture, it makes studying for the final so much more easier.</comment>This class is fantastic if you have an interest in neurobiology! The lecturers are a little dry sometimes but the information is fascinating.</comment>I took this course because the topic seemed fascinating and because it was a requirement. I had seen the q scores and heard mediocre things from people who had taken the course in previous years. This course has changed, and it is much better. The weekly quizzes are extremely helpful and ensure that you keep up with material. I highly recommend doing the discussion questions weekly, so that finals week isn't spent cramming all of them. The lecturers are fantastic, interesting, and notable people in the MCB department. Their stories, often with personal tinges, make this class so enlightening. The midterm isn't painless, but the other assessments make up for it, particularly the term papers. If you deeply engage with the material, such as through the term papers, this course will change your life and make you consider a career in neurobiology.</comment>It provides a fair amount of knowledge on general neuroscience, and is worth taking as introductory course.</comment>Only take this class if you need. The material is interesting, but the class is poorly organized.</comment>I would definitely not recommend this class. It is not worth taking out of interest. There is very little feedback, so it is incredibly hard to know how difficult the class will be for you until it is far, far too late.</comment>SO much interesting material!</comment>The professors are amazing lecturers. I found the content very interesting and all of the lectures engaging. Midterm is group and final is pure regurgitation. Psets are easy and term papers are very manageable. Overall, I would recommend just because the material is so fantastic and it's presented to you in a very nice way during lecture. Sections are more or less not helpful.</comment>This class can sometimes be boring but the material is really cool and the professors are really interesting people if you get a chance to talk to them separately. The workload is low but I would definitely recommend studying the lectures for the weekly quizzes and going to office hours for the first three problem sets to see exactly what they are looking for in the answer or else you will not get all the points. Papers are just reviews of literature but should be taken seriously because they are 1/5 of your grade and are graded pretty harshly. Take it if you love neuro because it makes me geek out</comment>If you think you might be interested in the brain, take this class!</comment>This class teaches a great deal about the human biology and behaviour. The amount of information might be overwhelming if you are not that interested about the topics.</comment>You really need to be prepared to learn everything you are given. Basically, the only things you do not need know are what they tell you is unnecessary or optional...</comment>This class is very interesting for me, but it is a neurobiology course so be prepared for that, not a psychology course.</comment>It's not the worst class ever offered, but it's very dry and is saved only by some excellent TFs and very interesting subject matter. Only take if you have to or if you're super interested in the material and won't be dissuaded by a very dry lecture series.</comment>Do not take this class unless you plan to concentrate in neurobiology</comment>Take this course, especially if you get Javier as a TF because you;ll definitely understand the material and get a lot out of the class.</comment>MCB 80 should not be taken for a Gen Ed requirement, but is a fine course for Neurobiology concentrators and other science concentrators looking for a jump into neuroscience. The material is fascinating. However, much of the class seems disorganized. Professor Sanes and Professor Lichtman are both brilliant, but fairly weak as lecturers. Problem sets did not assess material discussed in lecture, and left students chasing TFs via email and office hours trying to learn material that was never taught. The take-home group midterm exam was challenging and really extended students' minds to apply concepts to fairly abstract questions. The two term papers are great learning exercises, especially since they are likely students' first experience writing with scientific literature. Section component was strong, although quizzes given each week in section tested really minute details rather than major concepts. The final exam is in two days, and I'm not quite sure how to study except by memorizing every single fact I learned over the course of the semester.</comment>If you have a genuine interest in neurobiology, take this class. If not, I would strongly recommend selecting some other class. MCB 80 covers a ton of material, but always in a very shallow way that makes actual understanding difficult.

The first third of the class consists of complicated bioelectricity and biochemistry that is explained rather poorly and assumes an intermediate knowledge of biology, chemistry, and electromagnetism, including equations that you will never see again. This is followed by a lackluster section on neural development that just seems thrown in as a way to please all the pre-meds. After that, there is an interesting segment on mental health and neurodegenerative diseases that actually seemed fairly relevant, even if a number of important diseases (multiple sclerosis, autism) get skimmed over, if they are mentioned at all. Finally, there are about 3 lectures on "the neurobiology of behavior", or what the class claims it has been about all along. These include fascinating topics such as language development and learning.

If this class had focused on behavioral neurobiology, it would be getting a 5 from me. Instead, the professors decided that they wanted to suck in all the pre-meds, ruining this class for anyone actually interested in how the biology affects human behavior. Either change the name of this class to what it actually is (I suggest "MCB 80: Your Brain on a Pre-Med Track") and make an actual behavioral neurobiology class for everyone pursuing an MBB or psychology secondary, or just stick to what the course title is.</comment>This is a pretty solid class, and a good way to learn the basics of neurobiology. Do the discussion questions after each lecture - this makes the quizzes much easier and studying for the final much less stressful.</comment>A good and accessible survey of modern neurobiology.</comment>This class is awful. Very poorly taught and there was no enthusiasm for the subject matter. The lectures were painfully boring, and it was difficult to stay awake. You are probably taking this class because you have to, but it was a miserable experience. Take SLS 20 if you want the excitement of learning about the brain without the miserable lecture experience.</comment>Interesting material, but the class could be better structured</comment>non cis men, poc, beware microaggressions from nice, well-meaning profs. Otherwise great</comment>MCB80 is a fantastic course that everyone should take regardless of their concentration. This course not only teaches how the most integral part of a person's being works - the brain - but does a great job in describing the implications of this knowledge in society and the way people interact with each other. The workload is just right and the material is absolutely fascinating.</comment>Review lecture every few weeks, or you will not really learn the material the way you need to for the final.</comment>This class has really cool concepts but the presentation was poor. The take-home midterm is also given in way too short a time period, make sure you don't have anything else going on when it is assigned.</comment>Take this class if you're interested. It's not an amazing class, but it sets a great foundation for a psychology or neurobiology career.</comment>A great class that stays current and inspires with examples of exciting research that is happening now. You will learn the basics of neurobiology, build a solid foundation, and a get a glimpse into directions of current research and the incredible potential of the field.</comment>This class will be interesting to anyone who wants to know more about how the brain works. There is a good balance of technical information about neurobiology and fun material about developments in research. The workload is light, so it is up to you to make sure you review the material on your own each week.</comment>do not take it unless you need it for your concentration. material is interesting but the teaching staff makes it unbearable</comment>This class is not a painful one to take. It is difficult but rewarding. The information is interesting and lectures aren't too boring.</comment>This class is challenging, but largely because it presents you with so much interesting information that you are expected to learn.  If you have any interest in the brain and how it works, absolutely take this class.  Just keep in mind that if you want to be prepared for the exams you will need to go over the lectures each week in order to stay on top of all of the information.</comment>This course is (obviously) good for anyone considering Neurobiology as well as for those in Psychology considering the Life Sciences/Cognitive track or just stuck between the two concentrations. How much you enjoy this content and the style of learning may give you some insight of the general differences between the two, but remember there are good opportunities for crossover between the two tracks.</comment>You will learn a ton, and the brain is really interesting so it is great! The lecturers are pretty good and engaging, though sometimes I notice they just read off the slides...</comment>take it!</comment>Poorly managed course but the material is amazing!</comment>I wouldn't recommend this class unless it's for your concentration requirement, or if you're going to put in the work to learn the stuff on your own. It was interesting material, but poorly structured, and there is a lot of memorization of small details (e.g. scientist's names) that didn't seem to matter to me.</comment>This course can be interesting but it requires a lot of learning on your own outside of class.</comment>Great class, rough grading.</comment>Too much memorization</comment>The material in this course is fascinating and well taught. So far, it is the most interesting class I have taken at Harvard.</comment>The final exam was in my opinion very unfair. It tested very esoteric facts, so be prepared for that.</comment>Those weekly quizzes tho...</comment>A great introduction to neurobiology!</comment>ONLY take this if you have to. Not much enthusiam generated about the course even though the material is interesting. Not much insentive to keep up with it throughout the semester, but you really should so you're not cramming for the final which is pure memorization. The take-home midterm is ridiculously difficult and took my partner and I probably 15 hours within a 2-3 day period, and it is graded so unfairly considering there's no way to possibily know the correct answers to the questions they ask you. The problem sets are fine, I actually wish there were more of them so I could keep up with the class better.The essays are a useful skill I guess but also graded unfairly, you basically start with a 90 and then they just take off points for the smallest things. The worst part about the class is organizatin. It was completely unfair how different sections were and what materials each TF provided for their students; some students just had such an advantage, there needs to be more uniformity.</comment>I would encourage anyone to take this class if he/she is interested in the brain. Of course, there are many pre-med students in the class, and so the atmosphere can get quite intense, but the material is truly very interesting and generally well-taught. There is a good mix of "scientific" material (pathways, molecular-level material, terms) and more "holistic" material for those more inclined toward the humanities. It really is a very accessible class that is engaging and fair.</comment>This is a great class for anyone interested in neuroscience. You learn a LOT of information, and the information is taught in a wonderful way. Make sure to stay on top of the material, though, as you are exposed to a lot. I greatly enjoyed the class.</comment>You should take this course if you are interested in neuroscience and want to develop a basic foundation in the field. Even though the lecturers are sometimes not very enthusiastic about the particular topics in each lecture, this course greatly helps your understanding of the important experiments of neurobiology. You learn a wide range of neurobiology topics, ranging from the molecular basis of the action potential to the microscopic and macroscopic explanation of certain behaviors. Guest lectures helped put the information we learned into context!</comment>This class is a fantastic introduction to neurobiology for anyone who is at all interested in how the brain works. The work load is very manageable and the lectures are all really interesting.</comment>This course gives you a good foundation about many very interesting topics in neurobiology, and surprisingly doesn't have a high workload. As a neurobiology concentrator who is interested in brain processes on a very molecular level, I found this course fascinating. For those who are more psychology-oriented and don't like neuroscience at the molecular and cellular level, this course might not be as interesting. Moreover, this class is very much learning at the frontier, so there will be lots of times when the state of knowledge about a certain topic isn't comprehensive, so this opens up a lot of questions about how things might occur in the brain that the professors often their conjectures on. The midterm is quite difficult, but otherwise, everything in this course is very doable and interesting.</comment>It's a good course overall. Both professors are true experts in the field. The midterm is graded pretty harshly, but everything else is fair. The workload is light, but I still learned a good deal.</comment>This is a very good introduction into the field of neurobiology and current trends in academic research in the field. I think that the amount that you get out of the course depends largely upon the amount of effort put in.</comment>If you're interested in neurobiology it is a good intro course. Otherwise I would not recommend it</comment>It's a crap ton of information to memorize it. Basically only take it if it's a requirement. It can be painless if you keep up with the material on a regular basis. So do that. The information is interesting, but I found lectures pretty boring.</comment>It's a good intro course, and if you're like me, you probably have to take it so try to make the most out of it. You'll have to keep up with the assignments and weekly quizzes, which may seem like a lot at times, but the material is so interesting.</comment>MCB 80's material is fascinating. Which is why it's shocking that this course has the most boring lectures out of any other class I've ever taken so far at Harvard. Litchman and Sanes are absolute geniuses. My biggest complaint about this course is actually the slides posted on the website. For the life of me, I cannot figure out why there aren't detailed explanations under every slide presented. This is not a difficult thing to do, and could save very valuable time and unwanted frustration in trying to figure out what a slide is talking about without having to refer back to the video lectures and trying to catch the moment where the professor is talking about a specific figure in a specific slide when all you want to do is review the material or study it. If you are interested in neurobiology, you may want to take this, and chances are, you will enjoy most of the material presented. But be very aware that this class may not be as exciting as one might think.</comment>The content is fantastic, and the course has a wide scope, so some concepts will be rushed. The lecturers are average, but I highly recommend going to office hours.</comment>Just...go to lecture. Please!</comment>Be prepared for unreasonably hard exams, and always make sure to ask questions in section or office hours if you don't understand something. Students with biology/life science backgrounds are at a distinct advantage.</comment>course material is interesting and sometimes dense. but the material is worth it. if the instructors were a little more enthusiastic about the material it would be a better class.</comment>Only take this class if you have to fulfil a requirement</comment>The material is really fascinating, but the class was structured so poorly that it was often hard to appreciate the material.</comment>If you need to take this class as a requirement, you're going to have to bite the bullet. The content can be super interesting, but the biggest downfall that this class has is that this intriguing information is not taught well. 

Like a wine, one must relish and take time to savor the complexities of neuroscience, but this class seems to pour poorly organized information down your throat (and we all know how wine can burn if you drink it too quickly)

Be prepared to last minute study for the section quizzes and be prepared to have to learn information on your own.</comment>Although the beginning of the class (pre-midterm) is not as interesting as the second half of the class, to fully understand and grasp the concepts at the end you have to understand the fundamentals at the beginning.</comment>MCB80 is, frankly, just not a very good course. The professors aren't good at communicating what is important in the material and there are very few benchmarks to see if you understand the material. In addition, there are some strange course policies that don't seem to be in place for any reason. Up until the midterm, you work on several problem sets for which collaboration of any kind is forbidden, preventing students from discussing topics which may be confusing to them. Then, you take a group, take-home midterm which is unprecedented in structure and seemingly-arbitrarily graded. At no point do you take any tests similar to the questions seen on the final, and the only practice questions you see are assorted collections for which no answers are posted. If avoidable, I would avoid.</comment>Very interesting, light course load, the take home midterm was rough but overall a great course. Don't take as a gen-ed if you aren't interested in neuroscience.</comment>A lot of material.</comment>The course and interesting and provides a good introduction to the field of neurobiology.</comment>This course can get dry sometimes, but the material overall is very interesting. It also requires a greater amount of memorization of facts and details than other courses, and that could be a hassle for some people, but in general the class was enlightening and I'm more interested about the field of neuroscience because of it.</comment>its boring in lecture but interesting</comment>very interesting, a lot of topics but you have to memorize a lot</comment>This is a pretty good neuroscience course. The stuff towards the end is much more interesting than the stuff towards the beginning in my opinion.</comment>Pretty low work-load and great introduction to neurobiology.</comment>I loved this class because I just generally find neuro really interesting! If you're not already sold on neuro, I could see how you would find this class boring/frustrating.</comment>Neurobiology is actually pretty cool and the subject matter is really interesting. It's a hard class though</comment>Take this class to gauge your interest in neurobio, but be warned: it is still a big intro class, and not always representative of the field. Personally it strongly turned me away from neurobio, but it was still an experience I had to go through to make that decision. Lectures can be very dry even though the material is interesting.</comment>good stuff to know</comment>Take the midterm seriously</comment>While the course material is very interesting, the lectures are incredibly boring and it's difficult to know exactly what you need to know for assessments. That being said, the course is not anywhere as difficult as other MCB classes so it isn't too stressful.</comment>this is an extremely interesting class - the final is pretty chill, but it's important to stay on top of things throughout the year especially if you are not familiar with science. that said, the material is fun and once you understand the concepts, you will get a lot out of the class</comment>Make sure you have background in biology (which I didn't) to get as much as possible out of this course</comment>Do the practice problems accompanying the lecture notes</comment>Very interesting subject and engaging materials! However, wished the lectures could have been more engaging and had better explanation of the slides.</comment>Could be organized better but the material are spectacular.</comment>Its a good course, but do not take it with other hard courses</comment></course>PHYSICS 251a: Advanced Quantum Mechanics I</title>This class seems useless for any experimentalist. It focuses mostly on symmetries rather than actual applications.</comment>A solid upper level quantum mechanics course. Much of the same material as 143a/b but in greater depth and with significantly harder problems. To me, 143a/b often felt like plug-and-chug - this time around, you gain some real intuition and understanding. Vafa does some group theory, which is challenging if you haven't studied it in depth before but is very interesting. He's an excellent lecture, usually very clear and always open to questions. Problem sets help you learn the material and the take home final is quite fair.</comment>Ab inito treatment of QM, with emphasis on fundamentals (properties of and operations upon hilbert space, unitary operators, etc) and of the role of symmetry groups in solving problems. If you have not seen group theory (as I hadn't) prior to taking the course, expect that this part of the course will be pretty confusing (certainly at first). Problem sets are biweekly and pretty time consuming.</comment>Overlaps far too much with undergraduate quantum to be worth taking as a G1 unless you have to, as there's only a week or two of new material.</comment>Take this course if you have taken graduate level QM before. It is an insightful description and extension of what you already know. If you have not taken graduate level QM before, expect to teach yourself most of what you need to know and definitely supplement this with a textbook. The professor means well and seems to very much care about our understanding, but assumes you know a lot more than you might. He also goes too fast, and doesn't seem to realize that no one is going to ask him to slow down. Also take group theory and have a good mathematical background before the course.</comment>If the undergraduate program that you took included more than one semester in quantum mechanics, consider trying to waive this requirement, or take a placement examination.</comment>You will get more out of it by working with friends.</comment>The problem sets for this class provide a wonderful introduction to a variety of concepts in theoretical physics.</comment>The course is very good, but some might prefer to try to waive the requirement and take something else.</comment>A fun class! Thoroughly goes through ways of thinking about quantum mechanics.</comment>hardest part of the course is in the middle, with group theory.</comment>The lectures are very fast.</comment>A good review of some quantum concepts, but can be confusing. Seems largely geared to theorists.</comment>Pass out of it if you can. It is basically useless for experimentalists and just distracts from time that could be spent in lab.</comment></course>SOC-STD 98jl: Global Social Movements</title>I would tell them that this is great course if you know what you want to do with what you learn, but that in and of itself it needs a little work. However, if you're passionate about the subject, it does add things to the conversation that are helpful to know.</comment>There is a lot of work. A full load of reading plus response papers per week, but it is all well worth it!</comment></course>PERSIAN A: Elementary Persian</title>The class is great for those who want to quickly acquire reading knowledge--mostly grad students and a few undergrads</comment>Persian is the most beautiful language on the planet! Professor Boylston makes this difficult language accessible and fun to learn. His passion for the language is infectious.</comment></course>EXPOS 20.237: Woolf and Hemingway</title>This course was lovely and I was interested in the material, but as far as Expos classes go it was a lot of work and required a lot of reading, so I would recommend it only if you have a strong interest in the subject and are willing to dedicate substantial time to the work.</comment>If you have never read Hemingway or Woolf this class is a great way of getting to read and learn about both.</comment>The readings for this class, both primary and secondary sources, are excellent reads which makes doing the readings themselves as well as written work for the class really enjoyable. Professor Becker gives excellent feedback and the class provides a great forum for discussion with other freshmen.</comment>This class generates very interesting and engaging discussions. If you enjoy Woolf, Hemingway, or literature in general, then you are likely to enjoy this course. Take advantage of the preceptor's thorough and insightful feedback on your papers.</comment>All Expos classes are the same regardless of subject</comment>If you like Hemingway and Woolf, its for you!</comment>Make sure to stay ahead of the scheduled, and fully understand everything covered.</comment>Dr. Becker is really cool, really nice, and (most importantly) gives really great feedback on drafts, proposals, essays, etc.  DO NOT take this course if you don't like writing lit papers or if quality literary analysis does not come easily to you.  This was a HUGE struggle for me, and made the class way less enjoyable.  Otherwise, cool course.</comment>As far as expos go, I loved this class! Professor Becker is so lovely and made class go by quickly. She is very helpful over email and meetings if you have any questions about your essays. However, she likes "overhauls," so you will have to basically rewrite the whole paper after each rough draft, making it seem like you write 6 whole papers over the semester. You will be writing 13 short stories by Hemingway and Woolf and two novels (one by each), and will have to engage with them for each essay, so it definitely helps to be interested in at least one of the authors. The final research paper only requires you to use two external sources--and one can be one of the sources used in class discussion.</comment></course>HIST 1323: German Social Thought, Nietzsche to Habermas</title>Take this class if you are at all interested in this subject matter. It is the only opportunity at Harvard to learn about this material, and Professor Gordon is one of the best.</comment>Incredible course experience! One of the intellectually most stimulating and enriching experiences I have had at Harvard. Note, however, that this is a class on continental thinkers and much of the material is not presented in an analytically rigorous fashion. You will gain great insight and a solid overview over these important thinkers but you will not engage with arguments in an analytically (or logically) rigorous fashion. Nonetheless invaluable intellectual experience. Take it.</comment>This is one of the best classes at Harvard, bar none. Gordon is a wonderful lecturer, and really gives a sense of the historical milieu of the thinkers covered. That said, be prepared for the lectures to be a little less demanding at times than you'd like--there are a range of students taking the class with different preparation levels and that affects the course. If you're a social studies concentrator, don't hesitate and just take this class--even if you've read everyone already. Every week, every lecture is so rewarding I wish I could recommend beyond a 5!</comment>tough reading load</comment>You will learn a lot. The syllabus is really well-constructed, and P. Gordon offers very enjoyable lectures. Generally, I can't complain about this course. I suppose the only problem is that it feels like the whole time you're grasping to understand and just understanding the big picture, and not learning as much of the details. Still, if you're into social theory, it's 100% a must-take. Shout-out to TF Charles Clavey for kicking ass and taking names.</comment>Professor is a great lecturer, TF really knows his stuff</comment>Finally you are going to get WHAT it's all about!</comment>Make sure that you attend Professor Gordon's lectures - they're thought-provoking, informative, and he's brilliant. And try not to be overwhelmed and self-conscious in section: the reading is difficult and everyone has questions.</comment>Do some research on each of the theorists covered in the class. There aren't many, so if you find even two or three of them to be uninteresting, forget it.</comment>Great class. Highly recommended for anyone in the humanities - especially philosophy concentrators. For some reason, you can't learn Nietzsche, Weber, Adorno, Horkheimer, Benjamin, or Habermas in the philosophy department. But you can here.</comment>This class is by far one of the best classes I have attended. There wasn't one class where I didn't feel the need to think critically about the assumption in everyday life. Along with that, Professor Gordon is one of the most sincere Professor I have ever encountered. He really wants to sit down with his students and engage with them so that he may offer he knowledge and so that he may also learn from student.</comment>The reading list is absolutely unbeatable. Take this class. You'll have to prioritize the work on a weekly basis but it's so absolutely worth it. Lectures are consistently interesting and help to explain ideas you might not have gotten in the reading.</comment>Be careful--both the instructor, and his TF Charles, were very open and interested in helping out, but these writings are more than just difficult: if you're new to this style of writing, they are wholly inaccessible. They do not assign any secondary sources, which seems foolhardy to me. I got less insight out of the class than I was hoping for.</comment>This is a FOUNDATIONAL course for graduates studies in the social sciences!!! I was looking forward to every lecture! Prof. Gordon is a wonderful thinker, a great pedagogue and a captivating lecturer!</comment>Excellent lectures are the highlight, and excellent section with great feedback to your writing also makes it an outstanding course.</comment>Decent course, lecture can be a little formal and dry sometimes, definitely saved by section. Reading is philosophy, so be prepared to take some time with it. Gordon is an effective lecturer, not very relatable, but his lecture was useful. Social Studies 10b really helped with this class.</comment>I learned more in the class and enjoyed going to lecture and section more so than in any other course I have taken at Harvard. Professor Gordon make the material very accessible to those who have little background in philosophy, and the sections are run very effectively. Both Professor Gordon and Charles were incredibly kind and accessibly-- I was truly impressed and appreciative of how much time and attention they devoted to students.</comment>A masterfully constructed syllabus and a model for a stimulating lecture course. Excellent Prof.!</comment>One of the best courses I've taken at Harvard—and a course any humanities concentrator should take before graduating. This class entirely changed the way I viewed material in all of my other classes. The readings are life-changing, and Professor Gordon contextualizes, problematizes, and explains them brilliantly in lecture. The assignments are time-consuming, but they seem designed to make you think deeply about the issues at hand.</comment>This class is wonderful; it's one of the best I've taken at Harvard. The readings are immensely interesting and Prof Gordon has the exceptional ability of being able to elucidate these somewhat tricky texts. Even if you've taken SocStud10 and think you have this material down, you need to take this class with Prof. Gordon.</comment>Peter Gordon’s course was by far the most interesting and most well taught course I had this semester. Being exclusively exposed to analytical philosophy so far I was told over and over again that continental philosophy had to stay unclear and vague. This course proved the opposite. Peter Gordon’s ability to extract only small pieces from the author’s works but present that in a crystal clear way was amazing. I had never been able to follow somebody for 90 minutes straight without a single power point slide and without losing attention at all. 
The workload can be rather overwhelming but with the lectures you will manage to understand the sometimes quite difficult text at least to an extent that the main points will become clear. However, going through the material the evening before probably won’t work out too well. It is quite a lot!
Having Charles as a TF was super helpful. In section he could point you to the important passages immediately but he would also let the course discussion develop freely without getting out of hands. The amount of feedback essay preparation, the essays themselves and in reading responses (although sometimes his handwriting makes it hard to really appreciate the feedback :) was more than enough. Overall I can highly recommend the course especially if Charles is TFing again.</comment>This course covers a lot of the standard texts of German social theory and should be, for that reason alone, a class to audit for anyone with an interest in social/political theory or intellectual history. Professor Gordon is a compelling lecturer, and the narrative arc that he sketches for the course is helpful (to a point) in structuring the study of the subject. That being said, the focus of the course is much less on the intellectual history of social theory than it is on the exploration of the philosophical disputes at the core of social thought. Be aware that readings can (and will!) creep up on you (incidentally, this is a class in which it is well worth doing every reading, possibly before lecture)--there are a few weeks of Heidegger around the midpoint of the course that will seriously derail you if you don't stay on top of it. 

Go to office hours. Talk in section. Think deeply. Have fun.</comment>this class is a great introduction to continental thought (i imagine the sequel, french social thought to be no less amazing than this was). the college doesn't really have many classes like this, except social studies 10. i've always wanted to read much of the texts included in this syllabus but felt that i wouldn't be able to do it on my own, and this course really offered a great opportunity for me to dive into these dense texts that are at the same time very rewarding to (try to) understand! unlike a typical philosophy class, this has a truly historical emphasis that makes it side more with intellectual history, something that i think is crucial to reading these texts. overall, fantastic course and i've really learned so much! take it if you are at all interested in knowing about these german thinkers and their thoughts!</comment>Without a doubt one of the best courses I've taken at Harvard. If you have any interest in intellectual history i.e. in what the smartest people over the last 100 years have thought about society, culture, and reality itself, you HAVE to take it. Peter Gordon is a beyond gifted lecturer, one who can take the most slippery and knotted material, and spin it into lucid gold--all without sacrificing the intricacy in those knots. I often felt during lecture that I was transcending my narrow experience and that my daily, banal life fit into/was given meaning by massive networks of interpretation/theory/systems that have been swirling around people for decades. It was both one of the most abstract and most grounded courses I've ever taken because these theories and discussion ARE the structure of our everyday life. So go to lecture, do the reading, and struggle through the difficult moments in both. I often thought of them as really difficult workouts: requiring great focus and rigor to stick with, but providing an unparalleled (endorphin/ecstatic) burst at the end.</comment>Best and most difficult course I've taken at Harvard. I invite you to regard these two properties as necessarily related. I have never had my capacity for understanding more tested, nor have I ever improved that capacity so significantly.</comment>This is a hard course, with a lot of hard reading and hard thinking to do. You will come out of it having seriously grappled with a lot of those thinkers you always hear your artsy / Advocate / Comp-Lit/Philosophy friends talking about. You will feel accomplished.</comment></course>MUSIC 189rs: Chamber Music Performance</title>As always, a fun way to learn chamber music on campus</comment>This has been one of my favorite courses at Harvard and I strongly recommend this to any musicians. It's not a high time commitment but you can get very helpful coachings, and the coaches are all great.</comment>The Parker Quartet breathes fresh air into this course, providing a ton of rehearsal and performance insights while being great chamber coaches.</comment>Choose a group of people you like.</comment>Be sure that if you come with a pre-formed group, you actually mesh and get along well together, and are of similar levels. Otherwise, it may not seem worth your time.</comment></course>PSY 1852: Clinical Psychology in Everyday Life</title>be prepared to talk in class</comment>Probably my favorite class that I have taken at H! Professor Santucci is such a great lecturer. She is very enthusiastic about the material and makes you excited as well- it is very organized course as well, and the workload is very manageable! The opportunity to have class discussions is also great = you learn to love small group learning.</comment>Lauren is enthusiastic and approachable. I learned so much and loved every second of it!</comment>This course was awesome!!! I learned so much in this class. As I'm interested in going into mental health/clinical psych, it was great to learn how to apply clinical principles to everyday experiences. Lauren is a fantastic person and I loved getting to know her. Please take this class, you won't regret it!!</comment>Lauren is the best!</comment>Professor Santucci is such a kind and knowledgable professor. She is passionate about clinical treatments in psychology and that showed each week. The course load is completely manageable and the small class provides a comfortable atmosphere to discuss and share ideas.</comment>Take this class! Professor Santucci is absolutely amazing - she makes a two hour class seem too short, she facilitates great conversations, and the interactive examples of treatments really make them stand out. The content is great, and creating your own intervention at the end of the class is a highlight!</comment></course>ECON 985p: Research in Finance, Behavioral, and Experimental Economics</title>Stas is great! He is well-acquainted with the process of writing a thesis. He was very helpful throughout the semester.</comment>If you want to write a thesis, take this course!</comment>Make sure you have an idea of what you would like to write about and make sure you're really excited about your thesis topic.</comment>I learned a lot in a short amount of time. The Stata problem sets are horrible and you might as well just go to office hours rather than spend lots of hours spinning your wheels. Eventually you will come to appreciate stata but only after working through it yourself on your own thesis towards a goal. Also, definitely try to have a topic ready before the semester begins, it would make the process a lot easier.</comment></course>CULTR&BLF 38: Apocalypse Then! Forging the Culture of Medieval Rus'</title>This was a great class and I really enjoyed it! It is good for people interested in church architecture and iconography because that is the majority of the material covered in the course.</comment>Do the readings! It might not make a difference for how you do in the class grade-wise, but you will get a lot more out of it and they are really interesting!</comment>Don't be put off by the eclectic course title. You learn some wacky stuff about the semiotics of Russian icons, church architecture, and hagiographies (all of which are actually very cool once you learn their language, so to speak). The history is fun too. Class heavy on cultural semiotics = fun; especially good for those with an interest in Christian history / theology Also, taking a small GenEd like this makes for a much less faceless & degrading experience overall. We got to go on a great icon museum field trip, and by the end of the course we were all friends <3</comment>This is a such an awesome class!! I walked into the class with no other expectation than to fulfill my Culture & Belief gen ed requirement, and walked out with a newfound appreciation for the rich culture of medieval Rus. We not only had the chance to see many many images of Orthodox icons (and discuss the content, the background stories, the context, and more), but also study the intricate and magnificent architectural components featured in the numerous cathedrals and churches in Russia, along with viewing clips of ballets and operas. It was truly a privilege to be able to work with Professor Flier, who is able to provide a fascinating and extensive--yet completely understandable--overview of the history and culture of medieval Rus'. I loved this class so much, and am so so glad I chose to take it! Highly recommend!</comment>One of the few classes with a truly interdisciplinary approach, put to its best use. It's easy to scatter 'all over the place' with coursework in an interdisciplinary classroom, but in this class interdisciplinary approach worked well and helped consolidate understanding rather than undo structure. After Prof. Flier's entertaining lectures and carefully selected class readings - which included historical overviews, abstracts of literary texts from the period, cultural analysis via closer look at iconographic and architectural style and symbolisms - i came out of the class having gained much more holistic understanding and appreciation of the cultural and historical context of Rus' from approx 10th century through mid-17th, in its evolution. This class has broadened my outlook on the evolution and multidimensionality of Russian historical identity, as well as provided me with new tools/lenses for looking at the world.</comment></course>HBTM 235: Principles of Human Disease: Physiology and Pathology</title>Interesting to learn about different diseases by experts in the field.</comment>Absolutely. This course was a wonderful way to not only learn about basic science applications to human health. It also gave us the opportunity to not just learn about these concepts, but actually interact with the field.</comment>A ton of work, didn't get much useful information out of it.</comment>You're probably required to take this - so buckle up and try to enjoy the ride.</comment>Lots of great lecturers, interesting discussion topics.</comment>Take this class if you are interested in research about developing disease therapeutics.</comment>This course is a great mechanisms for PhD students to get a sample platter of physiology and disease.</comment>This class is really interesting but takes up a good amount of time.</comment></course>GOV 94py: Revolution and Politics in Contemporary Iran</title>This is a demanding class, but it is an incredibly rewarding one. You learn an impressive amount about the inner workings of the Iranian regime from one of the few professors who has personal experience and stories about the government and its senior leadership. The work is not trivial, but the payoff is more than worth it.</comment>A problem that usually plagues Gov seminars or courses is the broadness of the scope of the class -- this course is the absolute antithesis of that trend, for which I am extremely thankful. The granularity with which you learn about Iranian society and politics is one that other courses in the Gov department should seek to replicate. If you're at all interested in American-Iranian affairs or the domestic politics within Iran -- hint: it's fascinating -- take this course.</comment>Take it! This is the type of course for which you come to Harvard. Grades are secondary and learning is the priority. Some of the discussions will leave you in awe.</comment>If you want to learn anything substantive about Iran, this is the course to take.</comment>This class is not for the faint of heart, but what you get out of it is so worth it that I would tell most people who are interested in Government and specifically the Middle East to take it</comment></course>PSY 1901: Methods of Behavioral Research</title>If you're doing a psych thesis, then this course is necessary and does a great job of preparing you for the basics. Even for non-thesis students, I would recommend it if you want more of a foundation in conducting research.</comment>The course is a great way to get the lab requirement for psychology and the teachers are extremely helpful an instrumental in the class learning process</comment>This course is an easy way to get the research methods requirement out of the way. Extremely little workload. Just do your research experiment and go to class and you will be golden. If Evan is offering it again, take it with him. He was great!</comment>Evan and Steven are both really nice and willing to help outside of class. The class isn't hard but it also doesn't teach you a whole lot more than what you already know.</comment>Stay consistent with your project and you will be fine!</comment>Professor Kleinman is a phenomenal professor. He has great enjoyment in teaching, and he has a lot of experience in clinical psychology so he was definitely a great mentor to me, and a great professor for all of us!</comment>Get started early on developing your experiment so it can be as interesting and exciting as possible!</comment>This course helps out with a lot of technical details with regard to psychological literature and methods</comment>I would not recommend this as a replacement for a lab course (you will learn a lot more in lab and get a much better sense of what this field is about) but if you are a prospective thesis writer and have no other choice, don't panic. While you probably won't exit this class as a much better researcher than when you entered, you'll learn a few interesting things (like how the peer review process actually works) and experience running a simple study. The assignments are straightforward and the grading is reasonable. Fairly painless as requirements go.</comment>Not a bad class at all. Evan is great and so is Steven. Minimal workload. You get a head start on the final paper, which is actually kind of fun. The midterm is so straightforward that everyone does well.</comment>This class is far too basic if you are looking to really delve into different kinds of methods of psychological research.</comment>There was a lot of overlap in the material with Psych 975 for me (sophomore tutorial) in terms of how the research and publication process works, analyzing articles, etc.  But it did make the class pretty easy and the work very manageable.  The class is good for exposing you to psychology and science beyond the undergraduate level in terms of how it works on an academic level.  You also get good advice for all disciplines/future classes on things like writing good papers or giving presentations.</comment>This course is a train wreck that teaches you nothing, but hey, it's a requirement. Don't worry about the work load. All of it, including the test and the project, is really more annoying than difficult.</comment>This class is definitely recommended for anyone who wants to learn more about the process for conducting research. You get to cover everything from creating the experiment format to running the study to analysis. You don't get to conduct any ground-breaking research, but this class has definitely given me new perspective into what goes into a study. The lectures can be a little boring at times, but Professor Kleiman and Steven are super nice and always available to help.</comment>The final project (getting to run your own study) was super enjoyable, and the assignments we had leading up to the project were good, but everything else seemed like filler almost. Dr. Kleiman is great, and works really hard to try to get to know every student, but the course itself definitely had some issues. I work in a lab for credit, but I don't get to run/design experiments on my own, so I did appreciate having the chance to do those things in this class, and for that, I'd say it was a pretty valuable experience. But if you're working in a lab and having a good experience, then taking this class might not be the best use of your time.</comment>It was a boring class but you have to take it...</comment></course>HAA 224k: Islamic Art Historiography: Concepts and Controversies</title>If you are interested in Islamic art, definitely consider taking this course!</comment>The course materials and discussions were a great resource for people in the field, and good preparation for general exams.</comment></course>ENG-SCI 222: Advanced Cellular Engineering</title>This class give you a nice opportunity to read up on papers that are more oriented towards designing biological systems than solely trying to understand the ones that already exit. If you have already taken molecular and cell biology the material isn't really challenging, but it's interesting. The final project is fun and allow you to put some of the idea presented in lecture towards your own desired application. There were no exams, which was a plus.</comment>This is a good class to take if you are interested in pursuing any field in bioengineering because you will learn fundamentals of cellular behavior that will help with most fields (tissue eng, biomaterials, drug delivery).</comment>interesting class, cutting edge-content, moderate workload, and Joshi is a reasonable person and good teacher; would have been nice to focus more on genome editing or to incorporate that into the lab</comment>It course may not be suitable for beginner in cellular engineering as the professor assumes a solid background for all enrollee.</comment>Learned a lot from writing the problem sets by doing research on your own.</comment>Take this class if you have ever had an interest in cellular engineering.</comment>Good overview of topics related to cellular engineering. Helps you formulate a research direction for your PhD</comment></course>ECON 2395: Health and Social Justice: Reshaping the Delivery of Health</title>This class is the reason you come to Harvard. I highly recommend this class for all concentrations.</comment>A fascinating class but very little sense of what it is students are meant to learn or what they should be capable of doing as a result of completing the class. Material probably too basic for students with graduate or professional experience in global health or health equity, but may be a useful introduction for undergraduates and those new to the topic.</comment>You will not find more knowledgeable or renown professors. Dr Farmer and Dr Sen were thoroughly great to listen to. An experience you won't get anywhere else. The course itself can either be a lot of work or very little, depending on how much you put into the readings. Start earlier than you think you should on the paper.</comment>It's great in terms of getting to know Dr. Farmer and Dr. Sen. Other than that, I really don't feel as though I learned a ton from the course other than what I taught myself in writing the final paper.</comment>The clear strength of this course was the quality of discussion between two remarkable people with fairly similar views but very different approaches to inquiry.</comment>The class is an amazing opportunity to learn from extremely accomplished professors who care about humanity and bettering our collective world.</comment>I took this as an undergraduate. Undergraduate section was one of the most academically engaging and just fun times for discussion I've had at college. Lecture was pretty bad. There were occasional gem moments and the professors were very nice and funny, but it was unclear what points they wanted us to take away or why they were interesting. It was also often two hours of lecture without visuals, and without a pathway. It would bop from topic to topic more like watching Sen and Farmer chat-- fun, but hard to takeaway main points to play with yourself. Section helped fix this and we talked much more about how to evaluate and develop the best possible health policies globally.</comment>If you have the chance to take this class (if it's offered again), you should. This was an amazing opportunity — simply being in the presence of these two giants in their respective fields filled me with a sense of awe every time I sat in lecture. It's one of those classes that you will only have the opportunity to experience here at Harvard. 
The course was pretty lax, although the single 25-page paper at the very end was quite daunting — I think I would have gotten more out of it had there been shorter response papers (<1pg) every week and a shorter paper at the end. However, I appreciate the idea of researching a topic in-depth and having to write an extensive amount — it was my first 25 page paper, and something I think all students would graduate from college having done.</comment>Fascinating course but previous experience in discipline highly recommended.</comment>This class is new, so I hesitate to complain too heartily, but it was really, really poorly organized. The professors are such hot shots and I really, really wanted to hear what they had to say, but it ended up just being story time once a week rather than a real class. There was too much reading and not enough flow during lectures to actually pay attention to the nitty gritty details. I was quite disappointed in this class, but I can only hope that they can get their acts together and bring a really amazing class to the table next year with some time invested in organization, more assignments, and the like. Also, they announced that there would be section (with only two days of choices) during the second or third week of class, so beware if you have a tight schedule.</comment>I'd tell students to take the course and do the readings before class. The Professors are fantastic, but having context changes the way the class is viewed. I'd also tell them only if they are passionate about health or social justice: this is not for the uninterested.</comment></course>HISTSCI 167v: To Boldly Go: Science, Exploration, and Culture</title>I would say staying on top of the readings is important to be able to adequately discuss the material, but this course is really a fun introduction into talking about exploration over time and offers some really interesting trends to study over time. Dr. Shindell is awesome, and he really makes you think about the material in different contexts than you might be used to.</comment>Matt was a really excellent discussion leader, and I enjoyed the reading material for the class. Exploration isn't something that many of us think about too much, but it was really interesting to be able to examine exploration from Columbus to astronauts. Overall, great and fun class!</comment>This class was a very enjoyable seminar. Reading is interesting, and the course work wasn't too demanding.</comment>I would recommend this seminar to students both inside and outside the History and Science concentration as an elective. The course material is clever and thought-provoking without being esoteric, and the papers allow students to combine discussion themes with students' personal book and movie interests in a fun way.</comment>This class allows you to look in depth at topics that interest you within the broader topic of exploration. There is quite a bit of reading to prepare for each week, but the only assignments (a book review, a movie review, and a final paper) are pretty open ended when it comes to what you choose to write about. Overall this is a pretty relaxed course, but you get to read and discuss a variety of topics, some of which will probably be more interesting to you than others.</comment></course>AFRAMER 11: Introduction to African Studies</title>If you're interested in understanding mainstream african thought, this is the class to take</comment>Really take time to read the assigned readings and participate in class discussions. This way you will learn a lot about the culture and history of different African nations and the continent as a whole.</comment>Be prepared to be opened to a whole new way of seeing Africa</comment>This class is really fun. There are a wide range of readings which are interesting and the professor is a really engaging lecturer. I learnt a lot in class discussions and sections. The only drawback about the course is that there is not enough in-depth engagement with topics so it could seem really surface at times and I think this is because the course is trying to cover so much in so little time.</comment>This may not be an appropriate course for those who are not motivated enough to pursue a bit of independent study. I learned a lot in this course because I really took the time to research for my final paper. If a student is not willing to do the same, it could be very easy to come out of this course without learning a whole lot.</comment>It's a great class that has some really cool and interesting lectures.  But, make sure you do all of the readings because you will be tested on them.  Besides, they are actually really interesting!</comment>If you want to learn about Africa and need a fairly easy gen ed Soc World credit then take this course. However, if taking a Gen Ed is the only thing driving you, then this is not the course to take as the readings make the class worth it and are hard to attempt even if you have interest in the material.</comment>A good course! Each week is  different topic relating to Africa which is interesting.  Both the final and the midterm are take home papers which works well for a lot of schedules.</comment>Wonder course. Come with an open mind.</comment>It is a great class but be wary because it seems to focus so much on west africa. so it might not give you a holistic overview of AFrica. However, the professor is passionate about the class and he is fun to listen to.</comment>Prepared to have fun while you learn! And bring an open mind!</comment>You will get the most out of the course if you do the readings</comment>Lectures are very boring and didn't learn anything in them, but are only once a week. There is no work for this class except 2 short midterm papers and a final paper on anything in Africa.</comment>Great class if you are interested and dedicate yourself. You will get what you need out of it</comment>The TFs in this course are amazing and give great perspective into African studies.  I thoroughly enjoyed our discussions in sections.</comment>Its a great class. You learn a lot about Africa and African issues in general and you get a chance to have meaningful debate with people who are interested in the same topic.</comment>It is a really cool course if you want to have some introduction to Africa from a very knowledgable source.</comment>Deji is amazing.</comment>If you need to round out a difficult fall semester, take this.  Especially if you have orgo or something else that's notoriously difficult.</comment>The course content is pretty interesting if you have any interest in African affairs at all. The workload is also very manageable.</comment>its solid. more interesting for those taking it for concentration and secondary requirements</comment>This course is a mixed bag. Cons: Lectures are often dry, hard to follow, and don't tie in enough to readings. Readings are often boring, and hard to follow. Pros: Exceptional teaching staff who care about you and about the material, are very helpful and knowledgable. Sometimes readings are very fascinating. Class is very easy because not much is required. However, if you do do the readings and pay attention in lecture you will learn much more (obviously). Deji and Kimberley (TFs) are both fantastic, and to get the most out of the class you should spend as much time with them. The reason I took the class is because the shopping week class was conducted by Deji. Professor Olupona is not bad, and clearly cares about the material, but I'm not sure if he's the best fit for an introductory class. I do appreciate how he works to make lecture more of a dialogue. I often felt lost in class because I came in with very little knowledge of African history, readings were often too theoretical, and lecture didn't always seem to relate. That being said, very little is required, good way to do C&B, and you'll get to work with amazing TFs.</comment>Interesting and perfect work balance</comment>This class is really chill, and you learn a lot. Don't do all the readings, but if you pay attention in class, it will be a great learning experience with no stress!</comment>Very little work until midterm, final, and in class presentation.  Difficult to understand the professor, but overall interesting.  Easy gen-ed if looking for a gem class with little work.</comment>Professor Olupona is incredibly fascinating when he talks about African religions or Yoruba traditions, but otherwise seemed unequipped to teach the rest of this course. Lectures were given in broad generalities, with a clear ideological bent and remarkably little factual information. If you are coming into the course with zero knowledge about Africa, then maybe consider taking it. But if you have a bit of background knowledge, I'd suggest avoiding it. The discussions in lecture are particularly excruciating - most people haven't done the readings (which are generally unexciting), and the way to 'win' those discussions is to say that we need to move beyond the western perspective, without explaining what that means. The best thing about this course is the TF Ayodeji, who was enthusiastic and incredibly knowledgeable, and often had to clarify Professor Olupona's arguments in section. There are better courses on Africa out there, and I would recommend those instead.</comment>Very solid survey and very nice teaching staff! Reasonable workload</comment>This is an interesting class that fulfills a general education requirement with not that much work.</comment>It is very easy, but do all the readings</comment>As a whole, I did enjoy this class.  The lectures are not as structured as I would have liked, but the topics are still very interesting.  I knew very little about Africa answering the class, and I ended the semester feeling as though I understood many of the continent's complexities.  What made this class great was the teaching staff.  The two TFs were absolutely amazing.  My specific TF was Kimberly and she is the single best TF I have had at Harvard.  She made section engaging and was able to make everyone participate without section being intimidating.  She made sure we learned a lot about present-day Africa.  As a whole, the class is pretty easy, but you will learn a lot.  The papers give you a ton of freedom, and allow you to explore any topic you are interested in.</comment>Finally, a satisfying thing to take as a gen ed! If you are looking either for some basic knowledge of Africa due to having a White Guy Centric history education or are looking for a fun way to fill your Societies of the World, this is a GREAT class for you. Workload is **extremely** manageable, teaching staff is enthusiastic, and brings out great new perspectives for everyone involved in discussions. The one flaw is that if you are interested in specifics of African countries this is probably not the class for you (colonial and postcolonial history are discussed well though)</comment>This is fun and relatively laid back. I highly recommend it if you're interested in learning about Africa as a whole or specific parts.</comment>very easy</comment>I really enjoyed this class! Professor Olupona is a great lecturer and the whole subject of African studies is very interesting. Deji is the best TF!!! You'll have great discussions in section and good laughs too! He's very understanding if you need extensions on deadlines, just communicate with him. Also, if you don't have time to read everything, just learn how to skim well if you want to contribute to discussions. Seriously, take this class!!!</comment></course>AESTH&INTP 24: First Nights: Five Performance Premieres</title>it's lots of preparation for the listening tests</comment>I highly recommend taking this course. It really does do a great job catering to both people who are very musical, or not musical at all. Also, prof. Kelly is one of the best lecturers I've seen at Harvard. He really does a great job making the material interesting, and clearly loves it himself.</comment>This is a great way to fulfill the A&I requirement whether or not you have prior experience with music. Professor Kelly is a great lecturer and makes learning about each of the pieces really enjoyable. The way the course is set up, it gives you an overview of the last 400 years of music history through snapshots of different musical premiers. In addition, this class isn't super time consuming, even though it is helpful to listen to the pieces consistently throughout the semester to avoid cramming for the listening portions of the midterm and final. The bottom line is that this is a really enjoyable and rewarding class without being a massive time commitment.</comment>This class is a very different course. In very few courses are you going to be asked to spend time critically listening to great, sometimes lengthy, pieces of classical music that stand out as some of the most brilliant pieces of classical music ever written. In addition, this course requires you to not only study and listen to the music, but learn and explore the history behind it. This exploration of the history surrounding the premieres of these pieces can be slightly un-interesting at times, but it does help you understand the piece all the more. The exams do require you to know numerous terms (pulled from the history of the pieces), and having to remember all of them is a bit frustrating, and seemingly unnecessary.</comment>This class is fascinating and is a great way to become acquainted with classical music.</comment>This class is great to fulfill either Aesthetic and Interpretive or Culture and Belief. There are various things that one can focus on (history, music, culture) that can keep many people interested, but that may sacrifice some cohesiveness to the course. Take it if you want take a course with a moderate courseload and are interested in any way in music.</comment>!Great class that I really enjoyed and had a manageable workload, but although music background is not required, it really helps with the class.</comment>The required materials for this course are a waste of money. Don't buy them.</comment>This class is one that you will not regret.</comment>This class is an amazing opportunity to take advantage of the unique courses at Harvard, the brilliant Professors, and the chance to study something you would never have considered before.</comment>This is an excellent course! Take this because you can learn about classic works in both a historical and musical sense, and they actually give you a grade to learn something you might never have a chance to study quite like this outside someplace like college.</comment>Although Professor Kelly is very animated and makes lecture enjoyable, the class is unclear in its expectations of students. There are a lot of seemingly random facts given about the premieres and a lot of the information that we were expected to memorize did not seem very important (eg. that one of the composers fell in love with someone who wore pink boots early in his life). While there is interesting musical analysis, the class is unnecessarily stressful because you have to memorize a lot of music that you don't discuss in class which leads to many hours spent repeating melodies instead of really engaging with the music.</comment>Take this class if you have any love or interest in music.  Seriously, Prof Kelly is the best.  He is engaging, humorous, and knowledgable.  When you pick up the course book, you tend to read it in his slight Southern accented voice.  The book is a pleasurable read that I continue to peruse outside of the course.  I loved going to lecture, it was one of my favorite parts to the day!.</comment>Its a pretty interesting class and the coursework is not too intense.</comment>You'll enjoy the work!</comment>You should definitely take this class! Not only will you learn a lot but you will also leave lecture every day relaxed and happy simply by listening to Professor Kelly speak passionately on music.</comment>you should have a bit of a background in music and be able to identify and independently study specific pieces of music</comment>If you like music, fun lectures, and don't have a ton of free time to dedicate to a Gen Ed class, this is a great class for you.</comment>This class was just really chill and an amazing experience as well! Professor Kelly is such a nice, engaging professor, and the design of the course and the material presented is fantastic. I will say that some of the listening analysis would be harder for those with less of a musical background, though that shouldn't deter you from taking the course.</comment>The description is a lie, hope you like music theory!</comment>Definitely take this class if you have the time in your schedule. It's a great class to simply enjoy what you're learning about and can definitely balance out a difficult schedule. Professor Kelly's lectures are basically like performances - none of my other classes clap when every lecture is finished.</comment>I think if you have any interest in classical music, or even music in general (as most people do), it's a great class whether you need to fill an elective or a gen ed credit. Professor Kelly is an amazing lecturer and a great person overall, as are all of the TF's.</comment>I loved this course and didn't miss a single lecture because it felt like such a privilege to be enrolled in it. I definitely encourage people interested in classical music to take it, even if you have no previous exposure to music. My older brother who really doesn't like classical music also liked it because the professor is very dynamic and makes the material accessible to everyone.</comment>This is a course on classical music. Is that something you would devote a semester's worth of time to study?</comment>First Nights is a fun class to take that doesn't require too much work. Professor Kelly is a fantastic lecturer and the teaching staff this year was amazing.</comment>This course made me question my most fundamental beliefs about my cultural preferences. By the end of the semester, I had fallen in love with four pieces I came in ready to hate (and not because I'm an uncultured heathen, but because I had pretentious but woefully uninformed "opinions" about Renaissance music, Romantic art, etc). The listening is definitely a challenge, but such a pleasure. Monica and Michael are both terrific section leaders. Highly recommend.</comment>If you are willing to put in the time to listen to the music, I think you will enjoy this course. Homework assignments can be a bit sporadic. Everything is sent online or by email, so make sure you stay on top of checking that.</comment>This class is so fun! Professor Kelly is an awesome lecturer and is such a talented musician. It is really interesting to get to know the pieces. The listening parts of the tests can be hard, but overall I would definitely recommend this course.</comment>This class is a great way to fill the AI Gen Ed. In learning about music, it provided a nice break from other classes and an opportunity to study something different. Professor Kelly in incredibly enthusiastic and one of the best lecturers I have found here. I would have taken this class as an elective if I hadn't needed to fill AI.</comment>First Nights is great. Thomas Kelly is great. If Western classical music is completely alien to you, it might be a bit difficult at first, but the pacing is easy enough that most people should be fine.</comment>Take First Nights!  It has a very easy workload and interesting material.  Professor Kelly is an animated and charismatic lecturer, and the TFs facilitate discussion well.  Recommend 100%!  (Little known fact:  First Nights also completes Culture + Belief.)</comment>This class is a fun way to satisfy a Gen Ed, particularly if you enjoy classical music. Professor Kelly is a very engaging lecturer, and not very much work is required. Weekly section assignments are very manageable, as are the two papers (one of which has a creative aspect). Tests are reasonable, but it definitely helps to familiarize yourself with the music (listening) throughout the semester.</comment>This class will change your relationship with music in the most fantastic way.  Listen to the pieces a lot and approach section with enthusiasm, and you will get so much out of this class and do well. I want to keep this simple because the class is so wonderful- it should be considered a standard of Harvard college.</comment>Really interesting material and lectures- a class that you look forward to going to every week.  A musical background may not be necessary but will definitely lessen the workload.</comment>This course is an incredibly fun way to learn about music. Thomas Kelly is an incredibly engaging lecturer, and the multimedia format of the class makes it feel truly immersive. No matter where you stand right now, I believe that this course will make you love listening to music.</comment>This is a fantastic course. It helps to have a musical background, but is definitely not needed. This course focuses on the premieres of five pieces of music, and studies the players and places involved as much as the music itself. Prof Kelly is an incredible and dynamic lecturer, and the live performances we have in class makes the course material come alive. The capstone of this course is the world premiere of a new piece of music - it is an experience that few courses can and will ever provide. I highly recommend this course if you are interested not only learning about music, but also if you want to be able to better appreciate music.</comment>This is a great course to take if you are taking other very difficult classes and would like to lighten the workload.</comment>Fantastic course, lectures are amazing and the music is superb!</comment>This is a fantastic course. Professor Kelly is a very engaging lecturer and you really learn a lot over the course of the semester. Section is valuable, as well. It is certainly not necessary but probably helpful to have some kind of musical background for this class</comment>Good course, Prof Kelly is really good, but make sure you are actually willing to put some time in listening to the pieces and keeping up with a bit of the reading. Hurts the experience to totally blow it off for most of the semester until the midterm/final.</comment>This course does a good job of combining history and musical analysis.  The structure is a little disorganized, but the courses teaches a significant amount of analysis of classical music while putting each piece of music in historical context.  The hardest part of the course is identifying clips from the pieces on the exams.  For someone who has not had much previous exposure to classical music, it can be very difficult to distinguish between, for example, different excerpts from "Rite of Spring".</comment>This is a fantastic class. Professor Kelly is a great professor and I actually enjoyed going to Sanders to hear him talk every lecture. The midterms and finals are no joke, however, so be prepared to fully immerse yourself in the 5 pieces taught.</comment>It is not a lot of work except around times of big assignments and it can be difficult with no musical experience, but otherwise it is a fantastic class in which I learned a lot and lectures are so much fun to go to.</comment>Very interesting, but listening portion can be tough! You'll gain a lot of music appreciation out of this course though!</comment>Great class, if you like and want to learn more about music! Prof Kelly's lectures are a lot of fun, and the live performances are an awesome way to spend an hour during an otherwise stressful week. Know that you will have to learn to identify and analyze music just from hearing a passage two or three times (but the class does a pretty good job of teaching you how). Having a musical background was very helpful for me, but the class is doable without one as well.</comment>I loved this class beyond all reason! It wasn't a topic I thought I had any interest in, but the lectures were amazing, section was incredible, and I discovered a very real passion for a new course of study.</comment>This course will teach you how to appreciate and understand music. It will develop your ability to listen to and play music.</comment>I really enjoyed this course- Michael is a wonderful TF and Professor Kelly is incredibly engaging.  Lectures were very enjoyable. You definitely get more out of the class if you have a musical background  but it's still easy to do well in it regardless if you go to lecture and section.  You definitely get out what you put in.</comment>If you want any professor at Harvard, it is Professor Kelly. He is so knowledgable, so passionate, and so friendly. This class is in Sanders AND taught by an incredible professor and teaching staff AND about something so incredibly interesting!! STRONGLY RECOMMEND!!!</comment>Only take if you are extremely passionate about classical music. If you come into it without previous musical experience or past knowledge of classical music, you will start off behind a lot of the class. Not a lot of work, but exams are brutal... stay on top of listening and form study groups.</comment>This class is really incredible in some ways, yet has its faults. It provides a great look into five very interesting pieces, all of which are situated in a specific moment of time and composed by very interesting people. All of this is discussed in length, but this course is hard to appreciate if you don't already have some sort of appreciation or respect for classical/non-modern music. Professor Kelly is incredible, as is Michael, the TF. Assignments sometimes seem like busy work and there is a TON of music that needs to be basically memorized, but aside from that, I really enjoyed this course.</comment>Take this course! It's such a wonderful class. There's no better way to begin your day than a live performance in the morning, or an engaging lecture from Professor Kelly. The music is perfect, and he gives you the right tools to be able to listen to it effectively.</comment>This is a fun class. Every day I sat in First Nights lectures I thought, "Wow, this is why I love college. This is the amazing stuff we come here to learn about."</comment>Professor Kelly is the teacher you want at Harvard; quixotic, hilarious, and engaging. He appeals to everyone and makes his class immensely enjoyable. If you have even the smallest inkling to take this class, do so--you won't regret it.</comment>This class is absolutely fantastic.</comment>It is a very interesting class. I loved every piece we learned about, and was inspired by professor Kelly's idea that music is something that happens once at a particular time and space and disappear forever. However, I feel sometimes it is more of a show/speech rather than a practical and informative  class. For instance, the music knowledge we learned is not very systematic, because Professor Kelly often just brought up a technique when it appears in a work, and what we got were mainly separate pieces of information not linked together.</comment></course>HIST 1010: History of the Prison</title>do the reading and get engaged!</comment>This course has lots of potential, definitely shop it. It will most likely have been drastically improved since this '14 Q score and Professor Hinton is a professor you very much should meet and engage with at Harvard</comment>This class has the potential to be so interesting and the topic is so timely and relevant. However, was a total mess. We wasted so much time in lecture having "group discussions" that we hardly ever covered content. The readings for each week would totally change topics... it was very unclear to follow. Section was a TOTAL waste of time since we "did discussion" and group activities all the time in lecture...   It was not the most fun class to sit through.. but if they change a lot of things about the strcuture it could become interesting.</comment>Hinton is great! Giver her tenure, please.</comment>You think it's going to be good. And this course really could be amazing. But the structure of the lectures and section and the never quite clear focus of the course really make it unpleasant. The reading list by itself would have taught you everything.</comment>This course helps to provide a good overview of historical modes of punishment and penal regimes. A large thematic focus of the class is on Foucault's Discipline and Punish. Topics covered include penal colonies, convict leasing in the US, the rise of mass incarceration and the role of race in penal systems. Although this was the first time the class was offered and there were some difficulties with getting things started, the course has a lot of potential. Professor Hinton is also very enthusiastic and lectures include a lot of student participation.</comment>Be weary of this class. There is far too much reading and the direction of the class is sometimes unclear. It ended up being more of a class about race and inequality than about the prison system and prison theory.  Also, the section component of this class is lacking. In order to learn, you have to go to lecture.</comment>This is a class that will be interesting if you are interested in the subject. It doesn't count for Gen-Ed. You can take out of it what you want and find out a lot of interesting information about prison systems and penal regimes around the world that will help inform the structure of our prison system today. It can be tedious however and the course won't be pleasant if you don't want to learn about the subject matter.</comment>DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU WANT TO LEARN EFFECTIVELY OR HAVE A SEMESTER FULL OF PAIN</comment>This course had a lot of potential. Interesting subject that's not talked about enough. The Professor is nice but the TFs made it a bad experience. The TFs were very disorganized and seemed to never know what was going on. Take this course with caution. Midterm grade threw everyone off with the grading on essay being arbitrary. Weekly discussion posts you do not receive full credit even if you've done all the readings if the TF doesn't like you. Currently only know 20% of my grade right now after all the coursework is over so it's a little worrying.......</comment>very necessary course to take- prison is an embodiment and cause of many of America's most serious issues. It is a ponderous topic that deserves attention.</comment>Not much work. Section is not too helpful so does not really summarize readings. Powerpoints tell you what will be on exam but don't give detail. For instance a slide will say Transportation Act so that will be an ID but you have to go to class or look it up to get the answer.</comment>This class surrounds a very interesting topic that is especially important today. It also is relatively easy given that you don't have very many assignments, just a weekly post, a midterm, one 6 page paper and a final exam. However, I felt that I could have done without some of the readings which you didn't really need to read, and section is basically all discussion rather than going over content, which could be good or bad depending on how talkative the people in your section are. But overall, I felt that I learned a lot and that the material is useful, if not for anything else but being a better more informed citizen.</comment>This is a good class with a manageable work load and minimal commitments.</comment>Not hard but participation is a large component</comment>Be ready for many dense weekly readings. Professor Hinton seemed to have read off of a script in front of her for every single lecture.</comment>The section component of this class was pretty average, and the course seemed to lack any sort of theme(s).  Also, grading on the midterm seemed to be especially harsh.</comment>Very unorganized class. Often times felt in the dark about what was going on in the course.</comment>Fingers crossed that future iterations of this course will be vastly improved. The course could be really amazing, it's just not. It has so much potential, but this year, it wasn't structured or organized well enough to reach that potential. The lectures were more like section, and sections were boring and unenthusiastic. Some of the readings are pretty good, but others seem almost entirely irrelevant.</comment>This class has a lot of potential but is hindered by the lack of focus in section and lack of a larger structure.  I would not recommend this class unless there was a clear revamp of the structure of lecture and especially section.</comment>Lectures were not cohesive and it was oftentimes confusing where material and events fit in thematically, particularly in the second half of the course. Professor Hinton relied on student activities, presentations, and discussion to fill time. While this could have been productive, students sometimes would not attend on these days, and the quality of the in class assignments were not rigorous or stimulating. Discussions were usually "feeling" based, did not pertain to course material, and a small selection of students dominated discussion. Exam preparation was especially weak, which the teaching staff essentially admitted to in making the final exam drastically easier than the midterm. This was in part due to the TF's, who seemed to not have a firm grasp on the material and relied on students to run the review sessions. At the midterm review session, the handout we were given had instructions such as "eat breakfast" and "make flashcards," but nothing pertaining to course material. The teaching staff felt inapproachable and oftentimes unfriendly, which was likely a response to poor attendance, but the teaching style kept with the theme of the course-- punitive.</comment>Worst class I've taken at Harvard.  The course should be renamed "The History of Racism" because everything we discussed was taught through a discriminatory lens.  The class was clearly taught with an agenda to twist everything about the structure and personnel of prisons and law enforcement into racially charged motives.  Sections were not helpful, lectures were read from a script.  It was poorly organized and overall a really bad class.</comment>Prof Hinton is a gen. The course had a couple hiccups (section wasn't very useful, and the periodic in-class primary source assignments were a little tedious) but Prof Hinton is brilliant and kind and will certainly improve. The readings were engaging and especially timely given the events in Ferguson. Would highly recommend this course.</comment>There is a lot of reading, but it is all worth reading in entirety and not skimming. Go to lecture and section. Professor Hinton is very knowledgable and helpful.</comment>This class is great. Prof. Hinton really engages students in class and facilitates discussion even though it's a lecture format.</comment>Do not take unless you are history concentrator or if they improve drastically the structure of the course.  Also make sure that she doesn't let students ramble on about aimlessness during class like she enabled a few to do this year</comment>I think that this was a "learning experience" for the course because it was its first year. I'm so glad that Professor Hinton offered it because the class provides a great background into the historical development of punishment and the prison system and its impact on modern mass incarceration. Her use of a variety of multimedia materials and primary sources made classes more dynamic. The size of the course was a downside; it would have been better as a seminar. Do go to office hours with Hinton and do the readings!</comment>The material is really interesting, and the readings are good. However, I have two main complaints about the class. One: prof. Hinton broke us up into groups and had us present, in lecture, way too many times. This was really annoying because I felt as if I wasn't learning anything from lectures; I think I would've learned more had she assigned us the readings she made us present in class. And second: she read off of her notes during lecture. It was very hard to keep up with what she was saying, and take notes. This class can be a great class next year, if she changes these two things. The material is extremely interesting and I learned a lot from it; I think this class definitely changed my view about the penal system, and what needs to be done in order to change it for the better. I do not believe I would've held these views, had I not taken this class.</comment>I don't recommend this class. It's an interesting subject but not well taught which makes it very boring and not useful. Does not encourage broad thinking.</comment>This class was disorganized and uninteresting. Lectures felt rushed and weren't very informative, but the readings were good. The class is worth it for the readings if you are interested in learning about the development prisons and the modern prison system.</comment>-This is a new course with great potential.  The subject matter itself is absolutely fascinating, and Professor Hinton really knows her stuff when it comes to mass incarceration.  That being said, it needs a few years to get the right TFs and work out some problems with its exam and assignment structure.</comment></course>US-WORLD 33: Religion and Social Change</title>This course is an excellent way to learn more about African-American history and in particular African-American religion.</comment>This class will teach you a lot. It will be interesting. It will also be intimidating and scary to try to talk in class if you have as many graduate students as we did. Sometimes the course felt more like a graduate seminar than an undergraduate gen ed course. There will be far too much reading for you to do per week, but if you skim most of the readings, you will be okay. Not your typical gen ed.</comment>The content of this class was incredibly interesting and important. However, there was an almost ridiculous amount of reading for a Gen Ed. Also, this semester, the class was made up of about 50% divinity school grad students. So if you're an undergrad looking to try something new with this class, beware: your fellow students will actively try to make you feel dumb.</comment>The class is a little disorganized, and the grad students can be irritating, but Professor Frederick is wonderful and the material is really interesting. I knew nothing about the material before I took the course, and I'm really glad that I took it.</comment>Be prepared to work hard and read a lot!</comment>this course was really engaging and interesting</comment>Amazing class, amazing teaching staff, there's simply a lot of readings</comment>I learned SO MUCH about the history of our country regarding really important radicalized events and issues, and I really liked it for that aspect. However, it is half graduate students from the Div school who eat undergrads alive daily, so if you don't want to feel constantly shamed by their death glares you better be extremely assertive and read every book 6 times.</comment></course>ETH-REASON 18: Classical Chinese Ethical and Political Theory</title>It's a great course. I enjoyed it a lot, and my view of myself and others has changed as a result. Puett will promise that if you take the class seriously, it will change your life, and I can say that he was absolutely correct.</comment>This class is fun, you get to learn about the views and teachings of a lot of pivotal Chinese philosophers, beyond Confucius who many of us know a bit about. You don't need to go to lecture and there is minimal prep needed for section, you should do the readings at some point though because they are fun and can be applied to your own life!</comment>If you really need the ER Gen-Ed and don't want to work a whole lot, then you should take this class. I think there are better ways to fulfill this Gen-Ed, however. The content of this class has interesting parts, but it's hard to take the material seriously when very few people show up to lectures or really try to engage with the material. It won't change your life as a class, like Prof. Puett claims it will, but it also won't be the worst class you take at Harvard. It's one of those classes that will pass in and out of your life with little staying power. If you need ER credit, but don't just want to take an easy class, I would recommend something with a little more substance. If you just need an easier, lighter workload ER Gen-Ed, then this is probably the right one for you.</comment>This is definitely the most easiest and fun way to fulfill the ER requirement. I don't think anyone would regret taking this course, and if you really take the lessons to heart - it can definitely change the way you view the world.</comment>Great lectures with very interesting and captivating material. Puett was always engaging and enthusiastic, if a little bit redundant at times. Papers allowed a way to creatively engage with the thinkers. Wish sections were a little bit smaller.</comment>It's really chill and the reading amount is perfect. The TFs are really good. Many times lecture is a bit repetitive, but I would definitely recommend if you are dreading fulfilling the ER requirement.</comment>While a lot of people take it just to satisfy the Gen Ed requirement, I think most of then end up really liking it. The professor really cares about the material, and being interested in interesting ideas in contagious.</comment>Good class. Minimal work but still get a lot of out of it.</comment>If the topic does not interest you genuinely, it's not worth taking it.</comment>Excellent class. Even though it doesn't require much work, you should put in some effort so you can learn the material.</comment>It's a graet course with great readings. Sections can be frustrating however. Gives one time to think about how to grow as a human being - something often missed in the college curriculum.</comment>Puett is great, and the readings are interesting. Definitely the best ER class I've heard of.</comment>Easy class with low workload, and decently interesting material. Professor Puett is a fantastic lecturer.</comment>If you need to take an Ethical Reasoning class, this is it! The readings are interesting and you get to talk about them more deeply in section. You don't have to go to lectures, but you should since it's the best part of the class! Professor Puett's lectures are interesting and fun and actually really help you understand the readings. Also, go to your TF's office hours and meet with them to talk about your papers, since they're in charge of so much of your grade.</comment>I was sceptical going in, but I actually found this course to be pretty interesting and a very manageable workload.</comment>This is an interesting class that will make you think about important philosophical questions, but isn't too abstract like other philosophy classes tend to be.</comment>This is an excellent course! The philosophers are incredibly interesting, and there is not too much work required. But you should read the texts because they are super interesting</comment>This is one of the best courses I have taken during my time at Harvard. This course is a gem but it doesn't mean it's an easy A, I know a lot of people who didn't put time in and didn't do well on the essays (45% of the grade). If you put in the time not only will you do well, but you will also get a lot out of this class. The readings are short but extremely interesting and the lectures are incredible. You truly will learn a lot about life by taking this course. It has changed my thinking dramatically and I was skeptic about this "it'll change your life" talk early on. The one condition is that you are open to new ideas and you put in the time. Great course, great instructors, great lectures, great material.</comment>Before I took the course, it was heavily advertised to be life-changing and a must-take course. I don't know if that's the case and I do feel the course is somewhat overhyped for how easy it is and how interesting it is. That said, I would still encourage you to take this course if you want a good Gen Ed to fulfill ER and if you're interested in Chinese philosophy. This course is a great introduction to the ideas of some of the greatest philosophers of China before the Han dynasty, and the material is definitely intriguing--it makes you really think about your life at times (especially with the Confucian philosophers and the Daoists). Sections are interesting (if not exactly the intellectual sections you imagined) and Professor Puett is an incredible charm to have. This is a great course and I'd definitely recommend it (just don't believe too much about the hype).</comment>Better than most gen eds.</comment>Pretty interesting class, and the workload is as low as you'v heard. You will learn some basic chinese philosophy, and Puett is a great professor. Solid GenEd overall</comment>subjective grading- if you're looking for a course that doesn't take much time, this is it, but if you're looking for an easy A, be prepared to roll the dice</comment>Make sure you read throughout the semester!</comment>This course is what you make of it. It's an easy way to fulfill your GenEd, but it also lives up to the promise Professor Puett makes on day one: This course could change your life.</comment>Trust me, you have to take this class. And I hate classes.</comment>This is a great class to take if you're looking to balance out a difficult schedule.  The grading on the essays is pretty variable and depends on your TF.  But the final is easy and the work load is low, so I would highly recommend.</comment>Take it! The more you put in the more you get out but it can be as little a time commitment as you want. The material is really interesting and it's only two papers and a final.</comment>The information is familiar, but you think about it and learn about it in unfamiliar ways.</comment>This class teaches you skills to become a better person.</comment>This class was a great way to fulfill the ER General Education requirement. The texts and discussions are very interesting, Professor Puett is great, and the assignments are enjoyable.</comment>This class will expose you to a new way of thinking about the world.</comment>Incredible class, truly life changing in the way that you can grow to think about your interactions with others</comment>People take this class because it is supposed to be extremely easy.  While the workload is low, the grading is not as easy as you would think.  When they tell you to be creative in the essay, they actually mean it--writing anything even reminiscent of lecture will not get you the grade you are going for.  The material is fairly interesting, though, and the texts you read can be pretty cool.</comment>This is really easy.</comment>Great class, you learn a lot with minimal effort!</comment>Depending on your TF, this could be a great class or a difficult one.</comment>very light workload, grading can be arbitrary</comment>The content itself is straightforward and the assignments allow you to think about them better. You end up learning quite a bit and at little cost.</comment>This is a great way to fulfill the ER requirement; great lectures, helpful staff, and interesting subject matter</comment>Super easy class in that it is not a lot of work each week and really interesting at the same time. However, grading is very subject to your T.F. so it isn't necessarily an easy A.</comment>if you're sick of western philosophy or want a different viewpoint then take this class</comment>Readings aren't too bad, essays are fairly straightforward and doable.</comment>If you can get Neelam Khoja as a TF, do it.</comment>This course has a great lecturer, great and manageable readings, engaging and exciting sections, and great content. Whether taken as a requirement or an elective, I would highly recommend this course.</comment>It's wonderful and you learn a lot</comment>This course is a must!</comment>This is a good way to fulfill the Ethical Reasoning requirement. It is not very difficult, but it gives you the time to spend close reading the texts. Overall, it provides a good exposure to texts of classic Chinese philosophers.</comment>Fun class, smallish workload. Professor Puett is great and you should go to his office hours.  His lectures are very entertaining and he makes the material seem relevant to today.</comment>this is one of the best general education classes offered at Harvard. it contains a fair workload with interesting readings.</comment>Class that doesn't require much work. Great fulfilment of ER requirement. Puett is great!</comment>If you are looking for an easy yet thought-provoking GenEd, then look no further! This class is enlightening and generally very easy, with no more than two papers throughout the semester and a fairly easy final exam.</comment>ER 18 introduces you to the foundational texts of modern Chinese thought. The readings are very manageable (about 50 pages per week) and section, for me at least, was an interesting discussion and review of the material. There are two essays both are which of fairly open ended and allow you to select texts you are interested in, and the final is totally fair. It's not a stressful class, you will learn something, and you will take out as much as you invest in.</comment>Great class. Michael Puett is extremely passionate about the subject and its worth the new perspectives. Very little work and a good class to balance out others.</comment>This is a good way to fulfill ER. Not a lot of work, lecture largely optional. I feel like you can learn just as much by reading Wikipedia articles though.</comment>Is the best I have taken thus far at Harvard</comment>Super easy - the reading is less than 50 pages a week - you can do it an hour and a half before section. And the material is pretty cool - give it a chance and you might find yourself thinking in a whole new way.</comment>Take this ER! Lectures are engaging, the readings aren't too bad, and there's only 2 papers and a final. You actually learn the material because there's little pressure and stress.</comment>It's an interesting class that doesn't demand too much of your time - a relatively painless way to fulfill the ethical reasoning requirement.</comment>Make sure to complete readings each week and begin assignments early to give yourself enough time to revise. Essays may not seem long, but they require you to carefully think through ideas and construct a strong argument (which can be a difficult process if you're feeling rushed).</comment>Such a great class - easy and enjoyable.</comment>This was a fine course. You get out of it what you put in.</comment>Interesting lectures and reading, but don't expect to get an easy A. The essay grading is pretty arbitrary.</comment>I loved this course!!! It was so interesting, and honestly I learned more from this course than I have from many other courses I have taken. The workload was reasonable, and it was clear that the instructors were passionate about what they were teaching.</comment>This is the best way to fulfill the Ethical Reasoning requirement! I had never taken a philosophy class/ hadn't read much of any culture's philosophy, and this was an amazing foray into the field. there is very minimal work, and the lectures are enjoyable. They are recorded, but I would suggest going to lecture anyways--Puett is a great lecturer.</comment>Look if you need an easy Gen Ed then definitely take it. But this is not one of these Harvard classes you will look back at and say - wow. It's fine, readings and ideas are interesting just because they're so different from our ingrained cultural ideas of philosophy, which come from western thinkers. The class however is at a very superficial, almost high school, level. You will not get a lot of historic and cultural background and you will not be digging deeper into ideas as sections include juvenile role playing exercises.</comment>Great class, interesting readings. Lectures aren't really necessary, you'll find that they get repetitive after a while. Nonetheless, Puett is a nice guy and is passionate about what he does. Do the readings.</comment>Take it. Awesome. Easy. You learn a lot.</comment>If you are looking for a good class to fulfill your ER requirement, then take this class! It's not too much of a weekly commitment and the papers are rather open-ended, so they're not too bad.</comment>This is a must take at Harvard. If you take this class seriously, it will change your life in a very positive way. Go for it.</comment>-very very interesting course taught by one of the best professors at Harvard.</comment>Do the readings before the final. It's easy to slack in this class, but reading the material is really beneficial.</comment>Take this class! Many students do not take this class seriously and go for the easy A, but you truly get out what you put into this class. If you closely read the texts, do background research, and really try to comprehend the words of the philosophers, you will slowly be able to internalize their philosophies, and perhaps be "enlightened". Of course, this process is very difficult, so don't expect this "enlightenment" to happen quickly. However, even if it doesn't happen at this stage in your life, you may find that a lot of the teachings of these philosophers will resound later in life.</comment>Good class for ER.  Material is different but can be interesting.  Have to distinguish between philosophers which can be difficult.  Minimal workload, depends on TF.</comment>Very minor time commitment with a very rewarding ROI as long as you do the readings</comment>This course has easily been the biggest academic regret I have made. The material is completely irrelevant towards everything. There is no consistency in grading. There is no consistency in sections. There is little feedback on work. You get arbitrarily grades with no feedback. 

There is only one situation where you should take this class: you are a senior with a secured job, you don’t care about grades, you don’t care about learning anything transformative, and you are willing to put up with the final.</comment>A solid Gen Ed that works well for rounding out an otherwise heavy schedule. It's also very enjoyable--I found myself actually looking forward to 10 AM lectures. Writing good papers can take a lot of thought, but if you keep up with the readings (which is, again, easy to do) you should have plenty of material to work with.</comment>This class changed my life. Read everything and go to office hours. Don't worry about the essay grading--just talk with your TF early on and you'll be fine.</comment>Great liberal arts class for sciency majors.</comment>What everyone else says: you get what you put in.</comment>Do not take this class if you can't deal with or don't like philosophical abstraction! Read the following quote from Wikipedia about Daoism: "the absolute principle underlying the universe, combining within itself the principles of yin and yang and signifying the way, or code of behavior, that is in harmony with the natural order". Yes, you only read like 50 pages a week, but like the above quote.</comment>Fun class! The instructor is incredibly fun to listen to and you learn quite a bit! The readings don't take a lot of time, and sections/lecture will help you understand anything you don't get from the texts.</comment>this is a very good class with a lot of discussion and debate. very fun</comment>ER 18 is definitely a gem, where you can get a pretty good grade for not much work, but like any class, you get out what you put in. I found the readings really interesting. I didn't feel that Puett's lectures did them justice, honestly. The most important part of this class is to do the readings and discuss them with other people - in section, through studying with friends... I found that studying for the final with someone who was equally as interested in the material was the greatest help with this class. The essays are pretty open-ended so that you can write about whatever interests you, but make sure to get your TF to look over your outline/thesis.</comment>Great class, everything everyone says it is: pretty interesting, not that much work.</comment>take it. the material is veery engaging but not burdensome.</comment>This class will significantly change your view on the environment and people around you.</comment>Very interesting class with the course organization to support its own mission.</comment>I didn't have the slightest interest in Chinese Philosophy before taking this course. Professor Puett is so enthusiastic about it though you can't help but to get into it. The reading are easy and short, which is good because depending on your TF you actually have to do them. The essays are also graded harder than other classes here, you won't get an A just for a well-written paper if your argument is iffy. The final was easy, especially if you've done the readings throughout the course and keep a chart going of each of the philosophers ideas on ~6 main concepts.</comment>not too much work, but also not terribly interesting</comment>Everyone takes this class because they hear it's easy. However, a low-workload class and an easy-A class are two different things. This class has an incredibly low workload, but getting an A is very subjective and depends entirely on your TF and your ability to write essays.</comment>You can get away with very little work or put in some work and get a lot out; either way, this one is a gem.</comment>This is a very enjoyable way to meet your ER requirement. Professor Puett is fantastic and the class really gives you a great understanding of Chinese philosophy (and a bit of history), though it's certainly one of these classes that you get out what you put into the course. Workload is light- two papers and an exam, and the readings are extremely manageable (50-100 pages/ week) and enjoyable. Highly recommend the class!</comment>This is a very enjoyble class that lets you explore various Chinese philosophers and then reflect on how their philosophies are still present today. I found myself implementing a lot of the teachings into my own life. The essays are not too bad and actually allow us the chance to reflect into certain philosophers. It's also very helpful to talk to TFs about your ideas for the essay. Puett is a great professor and such a nice human being--take the opportunity to have a conversation with him.</comment>It's a great class!</comment>The lectures are repetitive at times but the class on the whole is enjoyable. My section was great as it had a great deal of discussion and interesting activities.</comment>Easy but still educational class. Worth your time!</comment>Good ethical reasoning requirement</comment>The readings are manageable, the final exam is a little bit trickier than you might expect. How you do on the papers could depend entirely on your TF.</comment>This class is really easy and quite eye-opening. Puett is a great professor although some of his lectures can be a little repetitive. It is definitely worth taking if you are looking for an ER requirement. TFs grade the papers harshly (there are only two), so be sure to consult with them about both.</comment>Invest in the material, its interesting!</comment>This is a relatively low workload class, but my belief is that you can take much more interesting classes that can fulfill your ethical reasoning requirement. If I were given a choice now, I would probably not take it. Not a bad course, but I think it's somewhat overrated.</comment>Great fun class that allows you to explore some of the most influential thinkers of ancient China. Well organized and engaging lectures.</comment>This is actually an excellent gen ed that is very intellectually satisfying as long as you are willing to put the work into it. It would open up your cultural knowledge in so many ways that truly change how you perceive the world.</comment>This class is fun, but don't be scared to commit a lot of time into it. Catching up with readings and starting essays beforehand really make a difference in your experience in the class.</comment>Great course. Highlights:
-Professor Puett's Lectures were exciting and enthusiastic. They got me excited for the material and he did a good job stringing the philosophers together and putting them in conversation.
-The texts themselves. They were awesome and I loved that we read no secondary material.
-Section (Yanping's) did a good job engaging students and challenging us to apply ourselves.</comment>You should definitely do the reading throughout the course and try to go to as many lectures as possible. It's not a lot of work and it really pays off when you study for the final.</comment>I thought it was going to be easier. I am sad.</comment>It is one of the best classes I ever took.</comment>Great course! not too difficult but you learn a lot and it's very interesting.</comment>Professor Puett gives beautiful lectures and the course is very interesting. The reading is not difficult and section can actually be enjoyable. This is a great way to fulfill the ER requirement and think about deep questions. It's a reprieve from some more intense courses.</comment>Do the readings! You can do well in this course without doing it, however you have the opportunity for a lifechanging experience if you do.</comment>Material is very interesting, if you want to learn a lot of it you can, or you can succeed without doing any readings.</comment>Professor Puett is a good lecturer and the section leaders are very knowledgeable.</comment>This class is not a huge time commitment. The readings are very reasonable, and the two essays are pretty painless. The course material is surprisingly interesting. I had a very good experience in this course even though it is way out of my comfort zone.</comment>You learn genuinely interesting things you wouldn't normally end up learning, and the assignments are spread out and not a lot of work. Take it.</comment>Incredible class that will change your thinking.</comment>Solid way to meat ER requirement</comment>easy if you read</comment>It is a really easy class, if you like writing. It is also really abstract and talks a lot about how everything in the world is connected.</comment>ER18 is great, do the readings to do well on the papers, meet with your TF. First paper is graded harshly, but it only gets better from there. Final was very fair, and comprehensive</comment>An amazing class to balance out a hellish workload, and it is a lot of fun as well. A gem for overloaded students who need a 4th class.</comment>Low work load, interesting and engaging lecturer, not as easy to get an A as you may think seeing as there are 700 students competing and TFs basically decide the entire component of your grade with section and essays</comment>This is an excellent class, and everything I could have asked out of a gen ed class. You get what you put into it. The material is interesting and the sections are nice if you've done the reading. Overall, not too much work and you end up learning a lot by the end of the semester.</comment>It is a wonderful class to learn about an interesting subject material! Definitely take it!</comment>A great gen ed class. Always fun to come to in the morning! If you do the readings and take it seriously you really can glean a lot of insight into how you operate as a human.</comment></comment>TAKE THIS CLASS</comment>This class is easy and you learn some cool stuff.</comment>Make sure you do the readings so you aren't stuck during finals. Make sure to highlight any important passages you find might turn up again, and attend section.</comment>Do the readings</comment>I definitely recommend this class for its great exposure to beautiful, inspiring texts and for the opportunity to engage deeply with them. This class is one in which you get out what you put in. This can mean you use it as an easy class to balance your schedule or that you take it as a chance to reflect on your life and the world and how to be thinking about it and approaching it.
Lectures are usually interesting, section is fine, nothing special, and office hours is amazing. Talk to Puett, he's really sweet and he helps you develop your own ideas without ever being overbearing.</comment>Please do the readings for the sections.</comment>It's easy and painless</comment>You will get out of this class what you put in - you don't have to put in a huge amount of effort to get a lot from this class so it is worth it to do the reading and go to lecture. Lectures are interesting and if you pay attention you will get a better understanding of the reading. I would highly recommend this course.</comment>This is a great class to take at Harvard whether for Gen Ed or elective.</comment>Do the reading! It's really not a lot, and it will be really really helpful. It is the kind of thing you can make up easily but you need to actually make sure you do that.</comment>This course provides an excellent and thorough overview of significant Chinese philosophers.  Please be sure to stay up-to-date on your weekly readings, as you will receive the most benefit from the lectures and section that way.</comment>Take this class! It is an easy and enjoyable way to fulfill the gen ed requirement, and if you take it seriously you will learn a lot about yourself.</comment>This course is an interesting and not too hard way to fulfill the ER gen ed. Readings are sometimes confusing and section doesn't really help in that regard, and lectures sometimes get repetitive... But taken as a whole, the class teaches you some pretty interesting ideas.</comment>I thought that the readings were pretty interesting, but I could definitely feel the level of motivation pushing down on the overall atmosphere of the course. The workload of the class is pretty minimal, but if you truly want to get a lot out of the course, put some time into it!!
Also, I found the final to be reasonable but a bit disappointing. It wasn't as grand as Puett was saying, but maybe I'm just complaining too much.</comment>This class teaches you interesting thoughts about Chinese philosophy. Definitely take it if you are interested in learning about the Chinese culture and politics.</comment>It is way harder than what people "say". Do not trust people, it is not that easy and if you are really not interested it will be a bad course.</comment>Easy and manageable class that fulfills ER requirement.</comment>It can go great or okay, depending on how tough your TF is.</comment>Great class for ER</comment>Do the readings</comment>This class takes very little time; readings are crucial to succeed in final and papers</comment>It's the only Gen Ed I've taken that is really that. I learned something entirely new that I would never have been exposed to in my concentration while never feeling burdened by it's novelty. The class is inviting with a manageable workload that encourages careful study of fascinating texts.</comment>Very easy course, and I doubt anything could satisfy the ER requirement less painfully. Required very little reading that hardly anyone does, and bulk of grade is two papers. Can be mildly interesting if you do the reading and attend lecture, but content is very basic and wishy-washy so it was a struggle to make myself have any interest whatsoever.</comment>Absolutely take this, great way to fulfill ER</comment>While the workload may not be that high, the grading is rather arbitrary and quite harsh at times. Also, be aware that the course TF and professors know that ER18 is sometimes seen as a "gem" so they are actively trying to make the course harder, both grading/work-wise. It was quite apparent this year in particular in assignment descriptions. Otherwise, if you're very interested in the topic, it could still be a good class.</comment>This is a relatively easy way to fulfill the ethical reasoning gen ed requirement. However, it is also a really interesting class with ideas that will make you question and rethink some aspects of your own life. There is a very manageable workload, and the professor and TFs are all really nice and supportive.</comment>This course gives a great overview with regard to the great Chinese thinkers.</comment>Great class and great way to fill ER.  Relatively painless, with two essays and a final.  The final is not bad at all and the essays, as long as you meet with your TF, will work out fine.</comment>The class is relaxed but still engaging-- the workload is very reasonable, the readings are interesting and accessible, and Prof. Puett's lectures are fantastic at providing useful context and highlighting the key themes of the text.</comment>Do not be swayed by comments that this is an easy class, and therefore worth taking. I assure you that it is a total waste of your time, and the pain caused by having to drag yourself through what requirements there are will totally outweigh what difficulty you might encounter in a slightly harder class. Incidentally if you want the same kind of depth that this class provides in this area of human learning, try Wikipedia. I'm not even sure the professor has done the readings.</comment>By reading the texts carefully, going to lecture/section, and paying attention, this course really will change your life.</comment>Meet with your TFs about your paper so that you know exactly what they want.</comment>This is a class that will teach you so much about Chinese philosophy. The professor never fails to grab your attention during lecture. This class is very easy to manage because the coursework is not at all rigorous.</comment>You learn a lot in the class yet it is fairly low key. Very good way to get ER out of the way!</comment>Chinese philosophy will differ from any other courses you've taken. The topics are very interesting and thought-provoking. Great way to learn about some history of China, as well as the culture, structure and people of China through the words of these philosophers.</comment>I absolutely loved this course and would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in fulfilling the ethical-reasoning gen ed. Although the readings are not long, if you takes the time to really process and think through what the philosophers are saying the class can help you become a better individual.</comment>It was a great introduction to philosophy.</comment>This class is interesting and most of the work outside of class is just reading apart from the two midterm papers</comment>Take advantage of this class! It really does provide you with a new way of thinking about the world, and I wish I'd kept up with it far better. Go to all the lectures because they really give you a lot of helpful background--I found it difficult to listen to the lectures online afterwards because I let them pile up.</comment>Worst decision. The grading is so arbitrary there seems to be no grade moderation between sections. TF that graded super hard on the first essay  then graded super easy on the second and vice versa. This lack of control over your grade makes it very difficult to enjoy the class.</comment>Keeping up with the readings (and taking good review notes during section and lecture) will make studying for the final way easier.</comment>I have found that your enjoyment of this class will vary quite heavily depending on your TF.  I loved loved loved my TF and she honestly is the only reason I so highly recommend this class.  It's an easy way to fulfill ER, and the material is actually pretty interesting if you take the time to read the philosophers and make all the connections between them.  Puett is intelligent and lectures are just an hour of him rambling on the stage (without notes or anything), but lectures were where big picture concepts were tied together.  Overall highly recommend, very fair/easy final and two pretty straightforward papers.</comment>A good Gen-Ed that doesn't require copious amounts of work. The readings are interesting if you choose to engage with them and on a whole I would say the class is thought provoking.</comment>awesome class, terrific prof and texts.</comment>This course is a pretty easy way to satisfy your Ethical Reasoning requirement. It's known for being the easiest class at Harvard, given it only has two papers and a fairly easy final. The final has quote identifications (none of which were very hard, and certainly easier than the review questions they gave us in section to prepare--plus, you get to pick ten you know out of the fourteen given), and a small, fairly easy essay (you get to pick one from four prompts). Section was great! I've never heard someone complain about their TF. You can get away with either reading (or skimming) or going to lecture--you probably don't need to do both (I knew people who did neither and were fine). I learned the most in section by far! Material-wise, you do learn a lot about early Chinese philosophers. As a physics and math double major, it wasn't the most interesting to me, but definitely a lot more interesting than I thought it would be! You learn about a lot of Chinese philosophers--maybe not very in depth, but it's pretty good for a survey course!</comment>This class is what you make of it. With very little reading and fairly short writing assignments, this class will undoubtedly become your "fourth course." Lectures are high level, repetitive, and oftentimes quite boring. Section varies depending on your TF. If you engage with the readings, the class can be pretty interesting and instructive. Unfortunately, it's easy to get away with not doing the readings.</comment>great way to fill an ER requirement</comment>It depends on what you're looking to get out of this—if you want a relatively pain-free way to get down your ER gen ed, and don't mind having your eyes opened to a totally different, intriguing philosophical tradition, this is your course. But if you are looking for a hardcore response to a Western great books course, you will be a little disappointed.</comment>It's relatively painless and mildly engaging</comment>Loved this course!!!</comment>It's a good way to fulfill ER. It's not hard, only 2 essays, which is good. Good to balance out a hard schedule.</comment>Ask lots of questions when you don't understand the thinkers....be specific as you ask...this will help so much later! (for the essays/exam)</comment>Super nerdy prof.  Don't go to lecture</comment>This class is the quintessential gen-ed. Easy class, but still to be taken seriously. If you're engaged in the material you will do well. Sections are fun and the discussions are always interesting. It's not that often that you get to engage in fun conversations and be rewarded for it.</comment>This class is not dense in readings, but it offers you a chance to reflect on each reading and think about the ideas of each philosopher. This class helps you to better understand philosophies of old as well as ideas in the modern day.</comment>great course</comment>This is a very interesting and easy course.</comment>This may be my favorite class.  Your perspective can and will be changed dramatically, in a positive way, if you dive in head first!</comment>It's a great, light course to take -- you still learn a lot though. But, definitely what you get out of it depends on how much you put into it.</comment>Do the readings!</comment>Super light-work class but not an easy A. Do all the readings, its only 50 pages a week and then you'll get a good section grade because you'll actually be able to participate instead of sitting there awkwardly. Essay topics are not that hard, but discuss your ideas/outline with your TF first as this will make your grade wayyy better. Final was easy, just some quote identifications (why you should do the readings) and a final essay. Also Professor Puett is really cute and so enthusiastic, he walked around all the different rooms during the final and just smiled down at everyone because he genuinely enjoys students thinking through his ideas.</comment>I think this is a good class to balance out your schedule. It does a good job at exposing you to Chinese philosophy, without making it a burden on your schedule if you're planning on taking harder classes. Overall, a good class.</comment>Super interesting material that, if taken with an open mind and application to the self, will be life changing. I still study the stuff today and the semester's over... Readings aren't too long, professor is awesome, section isn't too bad. Lovely</comment>Interesting class and a very easy way to knock of Ethical Reasoning. Hard to get above an A- though.</comment>An easy courses, granted, but an incredibly valuable learning experience that will expose you to new ways of thinking. It will disrupt your existing thought patterns</comment>Take this class and make an effort to get to know Professor Puett!! :D</comment>Just keep up with the readings, and be present at lectures and section and you'll be just fine. :)</comment>I really enjoyed this class. A lot of people think it's just an easy gen ed that tons of people take, and it can be like that if that's how you approach it. However, I think there's a lot of potential for learning about a wide range of philosophical views of the world. I highly recommend going to Professor Puett's office hours to talk about ancient Chinese philosophers or any aspect of life as he is extremely friendly, approachable, and easy-going in person. I hope to come back and read many of the texts in the future.</comment>The lectures start off very interesting but get a bit dry and repetitive towards the end of the semester. Puett is an entertaining and very excited lecturer, though, even when the material is pretty dull. The assignments aren't super hard; definitely go to your TF's office hours before each paper to make sure you're on the right track. Not too much reading per week. Section is the worst part of the course so be prepared for a dull hour each week. However, the readings and material are very interesting and can genuinely change the way you view yourself and how you interact with the world.</comment>If you are looking to fulfill your ER requirement take this class. Get off CS50 courses. Close your macbook. And relax because you have found your match. This class is interesting and easy. Reading are manageable and the lectures are bearable. You won't find a better ER.</comment>This is a must take. The readings are very interesting and the class can change your life.</comment>This is a pretty laid-back gen ed, but really makes you think about how you live your day-to-day life</comment>One of my favorite courses I've taken at Harvard! Really thought-provoking reading, and even though it's easy to get away with doing little, the course is really so much more meaningful when taken seriously.</comment>This class has interesting readings and painless lectures. Minimal assignments. However, the grading penalties assessed for things like (1) not defining terms, (2) unoriginal arguments, (3) too lengthy expositions, (4) not writing for a familiar or unfamiliar audience, were not explicitly stated in the first prompt, and so writing the first assignment felt like a shot in the dark. Section was often vague and more confusing than helpful. Easy way to get the GenEd, but a pain to sit through.</comment>Overall the course was interesting and good introduction into the Early Chinese philosophers.  The workload wasn't burdensome, however the papers are also not the easiest.  Overall it helps to go to Section and be prepared.</comment>This is a truly no-nonsense class -- just keep up with the readings, participate in discussion sections, and write two essays. The class gives you plenty of room to think about the texts on your terms and do your own analysis. Definitely stop by Professor Puett's office hours if you have any questions.</comment>Great class, outstanding readings, interesting lectures. If you engage with the readings, it's powerful stuff</comment>A nice, low-stress way to fulfill the ethical reasoning requirement!</comment>It's a gen-ed that's actually relevant to your life without even seeming like it's totally relevant to your life. For that reason alone I would say take this class. Of course, the philosophers themselves are also really cool, and learning about Chinese thought is very refreshing in a classroom setting when you yourself come very much from a Western way of thinking.</comment>This course is not much work, but papers are graded harshly.</comment>This is a great, painless way to fulfill an ER requirement. It was interesting and very light work load. The two papers were not hard and the final was not either. Section is actually interesting!</comment>The lectures in this class are very good. Puett remains fascinated by the topics he discusses and tries to convey this enthusiasm to his students. The culture of having such a large class, however, seems to make people not want to show up to lecture or do the readings. That makes it much less fulfilling than it could be. The papers can be graded tough, as they might have strict guidelines given the size of the class.</comment>I hate to be that kid who unreservedly and unashamedly praises a course as God's gift to Harvard. But that's exactly what this course is.</comment>This is a pretty painless course to take to fulfill your ethical reasoning requirement and the readings really are worthwhile. It gives you several unique lenses to think about the world and also makes for great discussions with your friends (since the class is so big, you'll probably know several people taking it.</comment>A great class to take with a group of friends. Awesome class taught by an awesome professor. Really do the readings and talk about them with friends.</comment>This class is easy and fulfills your gen ed for ethical reasoning, which is really hard to fulfill. Other than that, I didn't get much out of it. Puett said this class would change my life, but that was an over exaggeration. He also said the final was the moment that the all of the work in the course comes together, but that also was an exaggeration. The final had no room for creativity to discuss how these thinkers related to issues in the world today or personal experiences, which was extremely disappointing. Take this only to lighten your semester course load and fulfill a gen ed.</comment>This is probably the most accessible ER course you will find. I didn't like the culture of the course very much (very few people do the readings or go to lecture), but the content is really interesting.</comment>Get Neelam Khoja as your TF. She is amazing and her sections are relaxed but effective - you learn without feeling like the knowledge was forced on you.</comment>This class is everything a gen-ed should be. Full of interesting, useful information with a good structure and great professor. It won't kill you either.</comment>Take this class with friends.</comment>If you think you'd want to learn about chinese philosophy, this class is pretty interesting- experience though is of course highly dependent on teaching fellow.</comment>take this class if you are genuinely interested in philosophy. Though I found it interesting, after a few weeks of different thinkers I realized I actually don't like philosophy enough to take a class that focuses exclusively on it. That being said, I learned a lot of interesting things that I wouldn't have known if I had taken another course!</comment>Class is very interesting and truly enlightening, blew my expectations away.</comment>ON THE CONTRARY...this is a great class. Puett is a legend. He gets kids riled up about a subject that not many Harvard students would be talking about otherwise. I think all Harvard students should try to take this while they are here. The readings are phenomenal and offer a different perspective on philosophy than classical Western ideas. Things do get trippy at times (Zhuangzi), but that's what makes the course fun.</comment>Great way to fulfill your ER requirement!</comment>Very easy course, but did not learn too much</comment>The course reveals very intriguing ideas on the morality of people and society</comment>Always consult with your TF before starting your essay!</comment>This class is quite easy and required minimal work. Section was a good way to make sure you get the main points about each thinker. The final was annoying to study for.</comment>I would recommend this class to fulfill one's ER requirement, or if one were interested in Chinese philosophy. Lectures are wonderful, the class is not too hard, and you get a lot out of it.</comment>If you are looking for a class with meaningful work that will not take up too much of your time, ER-18 is the class for you.</comment>This course is a really great way to fulfill the ethical reasoning General Education requirement. Professor Puett is a wonderful lecturer and if you choose to do the readings, you really can take a lot out of this course, with a fairly light workload. Would recommend!</comment>Great way to be introduced to Chinese philosophy!</comment>great, painless, and interesting way of getting your ER requirement</comment>This a extremely interesting class.</comment>The class isn't hard and you don't HAVE to do the reading / go to lecture to do well, but it's like 50 pages a week of very readable material and I promise Prof. Puett's personality is enough to make the lectures worth it.</comment>I highly recommend taking this class to fulfill the ER requirement. Lectures are interesting, but not necessary. I would be prepared to do the readings to do well on the papers. Also, be careful about section leader because some of them grade unusually hard.</comment>Really take advantage of it! Work hard, and you will definitely be rewarded. Such interesting material and great teaching approach.</comment>This is a great overall examination of Chinese philosophy. It also gives great insight on Chinese culture.</comment>This is an interesting course, and quite a unique academic experience. Some of the administrative details are messy though.</comment>This is a perfect class for getting your feet wet in philosophy.</comment>ER18 is an interesting class yet it resembles more a history than a philosophy class. The lectures are very engaging and the two papers written throughout the term help bring the material together. The final is also very well structured and helps tie in all the different philosophers together.</comment>This class does a great job introducing you to various schools of Chinese philosophy, ranging from Confucianism (Confucius, Mencius, Xunzi) to Mohism (Mozi) to Daoism (Daodejing, Inward Training, Zhuangzi) to Legalism (HanFeizi, Lord Shang). The texts you read are all the English translations of well-known, ancient texts and it's interesting to compare them to Western philosophical texts -- they definitely have a different flavor and approach. I loved this class and would highly recommend it to anyone who's mildly interested in Chinese philosophy or satisfying the ER requirement -- it's a light workload (~50 pages of reading a week focusing on one philosopher) coupled with fun lectures and sections, and you come out feeling like you can speak to each philosopher's ideas. I learned so much from this class, and it wasn't a painful process at all.</comment>Puett is a captivating lecturer. I wish I went to lecture more regularly although I found listening to the videos on 2x speed as useful for studying for the final. This is a great class, though. I highly recommend it to fulfill the ER requirement. I feel like it has given me a much more open-minded view on improving life on an every day level.</comment>Don't just take this class because it's easy - I learned a lot of extremely interesting material in a very structured, digestible manner. It was a new and great way of learning and thinking.</comment>The reading load is relatively short, so I really advise doing all of them. It's only 50 pages or less per week. Also, there are only two papers and a final. This isn't bad at all. I do wish I had gone to lecture more though.</comment>good way to fulfill er</comment>This class is as easy as everyone says it is. While the subject matter is moderately interesting, the teaching staff (with the exception of Professor Puett) does not take it seriously enough to make students feel they should take it seriously either.</comment>Not a lot of work. Interesting material and readings, but very repetitive lecture.</comment>DO THE READINGS. I wish I did that earlier instead of cramming one philosopher each day of reading period. The class is great overall! It gives a good survey of the early Chinese philosophers and their main ideas and beliefs. It's also nice that this class's workload is FAR less than other gen ed classes.</comment>This class exceeded its reputation. Yes, it was low workload. Yes, the grading was not especially harsh. However, there still were two papers and a final, all three allowing for reflection on the readings. Plus, the readings were really interesting anyway, so anyone who didn't do them just missed out on a really cool educational opportunity!</comment>Very chill class. Puett's a fun lecturer.. for at least the first couple... he's enthusiastic but also extremely repetitive, so there's that.. All in all, very good class.</comment>This is an easy and painless way to fulfill your ER requirement, yet a rewarding class if you invest the time in it. Puett is an engaging lecturer who gives a clear intellectual progression from thinker to thinker. I thought the textbooks were fantastic, some of the best text translations I've seen. Section tends to be the usual unstructured waste of time it is in most classes: contests ensue between the kids who are really eager for their class participation credit, while others are drowned about by the loud few.</comment>I was told going into this class that it would change my life. I wasn't told this by professors or TFs, but rather by my peers. I was very skeptical of that - I cannot recall ever taking a class that even left a lasting impression on me (excluding math and science courses, that is). I wouldn't go as far as to say this class changed my life, but it definitely did change the way I think about right vs. wrong, morality, and many other ethical questions. It is a wonderful class.</comment>This class is great! The material is very interesting and presented in an easy to understand manner. Puett is very enthusiastic. This class is also great to take if you need a lighter but interesting course to balance out your schedule!</comment>I see you, Harvard student looking for an easy course to take
DO IT!</comment>This class is awesome.  Low courseload makes you really enjoy and appreciate the interesting material.</comment>If you're looking for an easy ER class but consider yourself to be relatively smart, this class is a waste of your time. You'll get easily frustrated by the basic-ness/stupidity of your classmates and honestly, there are other more interesting ER gen eds out there more worth your time than this one</comment>You can get by with minimal reading, but you should do them if you want to get the most out of the class</comment>You need to really be on top of your close analysis paper writing skills!</comment>A great, low workload class with an emphasis on primary literature. Experience is probably highly dependent on TF.</comment>Do the readings!!!</comment>You might take it because it's easy. That's true, but you shouldn't take it just for that. You should take it because it's outstanding.</comment>Attend lecture every week to stay on top of the philosophers.</comment>cool class but make sure you get a cool TF too</comment>Not difficult and thought-provoking. If you approach the readings with genuine interest you can get a lot personally out of them.</comment>This course is sometime advertised as being a 'gem.' Do not be deceived! It requires work, which if engaged with can truly change your college experience and wider life.</comment>You need an ER. Just save yourself some regret and take this.</comment>Fantastic for what it is. You can definitely get by with not doing much form this class, but the material is actually really cool and Puett is so enthusiastic you can't help but become interested. Put the time in and you will learn some cool stuff and not have to commit a huge amount of time doing it</comment>Very non-stressful way to gain a new perspective on the world.</comment>If you are looking for an easy ER class, this is it. You can get however much out of it that you want to, but you can get a good grade without much work.</comment>This is a very interesting class and, in my view, the best way to fulfill the ER requirement. The professor is always engaging in lectures and provides a good way to start off the day. Overall it's a moderately easy course, but be prepared to do a lot of close reading and you should also have some fondness for Chinese culture or ideas.</comment>This course is great if you are interested in Chinese philosophy. A lot of students choose not to go to lecture, but Professor Puett provides great analysis of the philosophers's arguments. It is true that the reading is only around 50 pages of reading a week. However, the reading will take a significant amount of time if you truly try to understand the arguments of the philosophers.</comment>- Great course! Actually go to lecture to get the most form this course! It is one of the best gen ends I have taken.</comment>I enjoyed this class. I took a more active approach in this class. For example, I'd definitely recommend going to office hours if you want more discussion of the philosophers.
For the class itself, the weekly assignments are the readings. They are about 60 pages long each, and if you really want to engage and try to understand them, it would probably take two or three hours each week. There are also two papers and a final.
Michael Puett is pretty cool, but sometimes I feel that he could make it more clear how his interpretations are based on the text, and gave us more guidance in learning how to approach the texts for ourselves.</comment>An easy way to get the ethical reasoning requirement that is both interesting and applicable to real life.  Definitely take this course.</comment>Easy Gen ED, especially the final. But make sure you did well on the essays that is where most people have difficulties.</comment>If you're looking for a light course load, take this class. It's barely any work. However, that doesn't mean it's easy. Your experience in terms of grading will be completely determined by the TF you get. Some TF's grade MUCH harder than others. If you want to take a class where you actually learn substantial knowledge, don't take this class. If you want a class with no work, take this class. Loads of people in the class take it because it is easy, not because they're interested in Chinese Phil.</comment>This class is enjoyable and not time consuming, the final is possibly the only final I will ever enjoy taking!</comment>This class can be very rewarding if you stay on top of the material.</comment>This is a good way to fulfill the ER category.  Professor Puett is a strong lecturer and sections are pretty good.  Papers are fair.</comment>This is a really interesting class!</comment>This class is great - interesting, fun, not a ton of work. Go to the lectures. They will help you understand the material and if you go to over 80% of them the final will be a breeze.</comment>Great class for exposure to Eastern traditions</comment>It's cheesy to say, but if you come in with an open mind this course will change your life!</comment>It is a class that is extremely interesting and can truly change your perspective on how you live your life.</comment>This course is extremely interesting and the content taught is very valuable.</comment>Easy class that you get as much out of as you put in, but I think you do learn and see the world a little differently. Puett is wonderful, and it is a great course to balance heavier math/scientific courses.</comment>This is an excellent way to fulfill the Ethical Reasoning requirement. It's a wonderful approach to philosophy from a less-explored angle. Professor Puett makes the subject matter extremely interesting, and it is a well-structured course. You will be asked to engage with the material in a meaningful matter, however. Simply summarizing what was said in lecture and section will not be enough to get a good grade on your papers (a creative, argumentative thesis will be required). You won't really have to worry about dates, and other more difficult material, however. Overall an excellent course, don't be scared away by the size of it.</comment>This class will give you a global but not an in depth introduction to Chinese philosophy</comment>Take this class before you graduate. It is the ultimate Harvard class - interesting, applicable, and as much work as you want it to be. You won't regret it.</comment>It's not hard. The papers are clear and straightforward and easy to engage with the material being covered. Section is iffy; I had friends who loved the class simply because their sections were dope, but others, myself included, didn't feel so fondly for the class because our sections were poorly done. The final requires a lot of prep but is fair.</comment>Interesting, the assignments and the work don't get in the way of learning the material. Nothing superfluous.</comment>Should definitely read</comment>Ended up never going to lectures. Total hit or miss with TF's. I did not like mine at all and she was ridiculously tough on grading our papers, while I heard other TF's gave A's to everyone. Regret taking the class.</comment>This class is definitely not a lot of work - but they are hard graders. They grade you more then they teach you. (depending on your TF).</comment>The professor is great, gives exciting lectures. The class component is enjoyable; however,having a bad TF easily ruins this class. The essays are graded arbitrarily. The papers are harder than they appear.</comment>Easy class and great way to fulfill ethical reasoning. Do the readings, understand the material, and you'll be fine.</comment>I think this class is a great way to fulfill Ethical Reasoning. It's very interesting, and it's enriching to both your academics and your personal life. The readings each week are very interesting and very manageable. Similarly, the assignments are two short papers and one final exam. It's a great class--take it!</comment>This class is an easy way to fulfill the ER requirement. You get out of it what you put into it, so it can potentially be really interesting and thought-provoking. The class has a very low workload. It's very easy to get an A-, but getting an A may require a bit more effort.</comment>Fun class to take, you learn about as much as you want to based on how much time you put in.</comment>Not too hard if you do the reading.</comment>This is a great class to fulfill the ER requirement. The professor is amazing, the TFs are really nice and helpful and the work load is light.</comment>If you do the readings, go to lecture, and participate in section, you will get a lot more out of this class than you would otherwise! The texts are really interesting, but are more enlightening after you've talked about them a bit</comment>Very interesting class that you would enjoy taking.</comment>I took this class because it seemed like the most painless way to satisfy ER, but you should only take it if you are at least mildly interested in the readings. Still, a very manageable class.</comment>Great course. If you are thinking about taking it, take it.</comment>This is a good class that requires minimal workload and commitment, but will honestly provide you with interesting material if you decide to invest in it</comment>If you do the readings and are engaged in section, you'll get s lot out of the class.</comment>This is a low workload class that opens your eyes to the realm of Chinese philosophy and may help you view the world in a whole new way.</comment>Might as well spend a little time on readings, will help on final and papers.</comment>It is pretty easy. You dont need to go to lecture at all.  Just do the readings and pay attention in section and you will be fine.</comment>ER 18 did not disappoint as a manageable and easy Gen-Ed. The readings weren't too long, and it's very easy to get by the class without doing the readings and just going to lecture. Prof. Puett is very repetitive so it's easy to get the gist of the lectures, and section is also not overly difficult. The final isn't too bad except for the passage IDs, so do the readings to be able to manage those. Overall a good and easy Gen-Ed with interesting curriculum.</comment>don't take it</comment>Work on those essays.</comment>Make sure to do the readings because you can learn a lot from them.</comment>This class was very manageable and was able to keep things interesting the whole semester.</comment>It's a lot of fun, Professor Puett is amazing, and it's not that much work but the material is pretty interesting no matter what your interests are.</comment>This class will live up to the professor's promise at the beginning that it will profoundly change the way you think about the world. I'm so glad to have taken it.</comment>If you need an ER and are not overly familiar with the material already, take this class. Those with a strong grounding in Eastern philosophy might find it overly basic. However, the awesomeness of Michael Puett might still be enough to put this in your list of classes to consider - particularly as Puett's lectures on the texts are nuanced and accessible, and may enrich even those who are well-familiar with the concepts.</comment>great class</comment>This class incorporates some of the philosophy it teaches into the way the class is taught, which is really cool. It is also different from other classes at Harvard in that it is not very much work on a week-to-week basis, so that you are actually able to do all the reading without skimming and really engage with it in a deep and meaningful way. Michael Puett is an amazing lecturer and makes the material really accessible and relevant and encourages you to apply it to change the way you live your daily life. I think Chinese philosophy is fascinating anyway, but even if you're not super into it, you can still take away a lot from this class.</comment>This class is indeed an easy course in terms of workload, yet the philosophers and their ideas are by no means simple and easy. It takes time to do the readings and fully understand their implications. At first I was tricked by Professor Puett's lectures because they were REALLY interesting. However, at some point in the semester I feel like he stopped making good logical progressions between ideas and I got lost in lecture.</comment>Class is very straightforward in terms of the philosophies discussed. A lot of ideas are abstract so it's important to reach out to your TF to discuss them. Manageable reading and the papers were open-ended. Best ER you'll get around these parts.</comment>If you're not interested in the course material this course doesn't do a great job of engaging you or making it interesting. It's not a lot of work but it's worth it to take a more interesting class</comment>Read these texts, really read them with an open mind.</comment>This is a great class to take.</comment>As a STEM concentrator, it was so freaking refreshing to take a class that I felt I could succeed in. This class was so easy and so enjoyable. Thank you, Puett, for exposing me to a new sector of academia, one that I think I would have truly enjoyed more than engineering.</comment>This class is definitely worth your time. Although it is not extremely rigorous, it covers the material in an in-depth fashion.  It broadened my perspective.</comment>This class was a great first philosophy course, and Professor Puett's enthusiasm for the subject is contagious. He is also genuinely interested in talking to his students 1:1, which you should definitely take advantage of. I loved having the opportunity to engage with a heretofore completely unfamiliar subject, and now I feel like I have a great understanding of the philosophers we covered.</comment>really well organized - you will actually leave with an understanding of chinese philosophy.</comment>Don't worry so much about the grade as trying to get some useful insights about life out of the course.</comment>A ton of fun, very useful, and a very reasonable time commitment.</comment>I would recommend this course, but realize that you are taking a course with individuals who might not be as interested in the subject matter as you are.</comment>Everything I read about this class told me it would be 'life-changing.'  In the end, I came to the disheartening conclusion that this is Harvard-speak for "easy to completely blow off lecture and still do decently well by fudging your way through section."  Professor Puett is really passionate about the material, but sometimes his lectures end up being extremely circular and repetitious of material already covered.  I did not have a great section experience in this class; although Yanping was very nice, my section experience was disorganized and confused, which intensified the feeling that I did not really glean anything from the texts covered in this class.  Admittedly I had high expectations for a class branded as being 'life-changing.'  However, it is not an exaggeration to say that I was disappointed on even a basic level.  In the end, this ended up being 'just another annoying gen ed.'  A disheartening experience to say the least.</comment>Puett keeps lectures interesting and very easy to follow. Go to lectures, they will help you understand the general themes of the readings and the philosophers' general attitudes towards topics. Trying to understand them on your own is kind of a struggle. If you get a good TF, sections will be immensely helpful as well.</comment></course>ANTHRO 1095: Urban Revolutions: Archaeology and the Investigation of Early States</title>If you're looking for an interesting but easy course, this is the one for you. Lectures and readings can often be dry and boring, but the work load is very minimal and there are only a couple of essays. If you're interested in archaeology, this is a pretty cool course where you learn how different civilizations developed form an archaeological perspective.</comment>Lots of learning about a different society</comment>If you are looking for a very interesting class without a heavy workload, then this is the class for you.</comment>This class was a gem. the material can be a bit repetitive sometimes (making it easier to skip class occasionally), but it's really cool to learn about how human beings developed the complex, stratified societies we see today. Cool conversation topic. The TF is an awesome dude who is more than willing to help on the *two* assignments we had all year. We also only had two section meetings. This class is awesome.</comment>This is a great switch up from your concentration if you're not an anthropology major.</comment>Take it! Take home midterm and finals, good explanations of what they are looking for.</comment>Great class gema</comment>A good class. Take it if you need a class with a low workload.</comment>This class is a cool way to learn some basic anthro/archaeology. I knew nothing going in and had no problems.</comment>This class was very interesting and the readings, though they were long, were beneficial to the assignments.</comment>Take course if interested in history as this class will be much more for you</comment>This course was a fantastic overview of the study of ancient civilizations. Professor Lamberg-Karlovsky is not only a leading authority in the field, but he was an incredibly engaging professor who brought colorful personal insight into his lectures. Having no prior interest in the subject, I was surprised by how much I learned and how interested I was in the course material. As TF, Yitzchak did a phenomenal job facilitating the course and giving us feedback on our essays.</comment>Take this class! It was easy/fun.  No downside.</comment>very easy A</comment>It's a good class with limited work.</comment>This is a great class! Professor Lamberg-Karlovsky is ridiculously qualified. He has had so much experience in archeology and has traveled to so many places. He's very articulate while being down-to-earth when he needs to be. The TF was also very supportive and helpful along the way!</comment>Very little work and difficulty comes from this class. Extremely enjoyable and unstressful.</comment></course>SOC-WORLD 12: China</title>Excellent course. The professors are really smart and engaging. One of my favorite courses at Harvard. The case studies are also fun, though they are lacking a bit in terms of mirroring a real case study.</comment>This is a great class but be prepared to spend a lot of time on it!</comment>The perfect introduction to China, a good fit whether or not you have prior experience.</comment>This is a good class with good, interesting professors, but be willing to put in work for the modules and readings.</comment>Don't take it just to get the SW gen ed done. Take it because you want to learn about China. If you just want to get your gen ed done, you won't appreciate this course, but if you ARE interested in China, you'll like this course quite a bit.</comment>It's definitely a course on China's history, from ancient until now, so if you're only interested in certain periods, probably isn't the best class for that. Also, there was a pretty heavy emphasis on business cases towards the end (i.e. modern Chinese history) since that was Prof. Kirby's half, but I think it took away from me learning about historically relevant China facts from about Mao era on.</comment>Do the work for YOURSELF more than anyone else.  Even if discussions in class go astray, you will learn a bunch from the material itself as well!</comment>Professor Bol and Professor Kirby are both fantastic and extremely knowledgable. The lecture video method used to teach this class is effective to some degree, but the amount of time you will need to put in to this class should be noted. Though this is a gen-ed, the lecture videos take a significant chunk of time to watch, and there are quizzes interspersed between these videos to make sure you're retaining the content. All that being said, I feel much more knowledgeable about modern China and China's history after taking this course.</comment>Do not take a class that has online EdX parts.</comment>The online quizzes don't test your understanding and the answers are very confusing.</comment>This is a course that allows you to engage with professors on a very close basis, and it's discussion based as well!</comment>Don't take this class if you're looking to learn about Chinese history without any prior knowledge. This class is strongly catered towards those who are already familiar with Chinese history.</comment>This course is a great introduction into Chinese history - it provides you with a strong overview of a complicated topic as well as some of the best professors on the planet in this field. I would not describe it as light in workload, but it is definitely manageable and if you are enthusiastic about the topic it shouldn't be a problem.</comment>If you are at all interested in China or want to know more about it, this course is a must take.  Alternatively, having taken many gen eds, this is in my opinion the best societies of the world class out there and should be taken by anyone looking to fulfill that requirement and add value to themselves.</comment></course>SANSKRIT 101a: Elementary Sanskrit</title>My guess is that Sanskrit probably attracts a niche group of students, but for those who are interested I can absolutely recommend this class, especially if Tyler teaches it!</comment>Scheduling a regular time to drill paradigms and vocabulary at the beginning of the term, and keeping to that time, will help immensely.</comment>Sanskrit can be daunting - but Tyler makes this class amazingly approachable and digestable. It's been very rewarding to see a seemingly-impenetrable language slowly but surely come alive!</comment>This course requires a lot effort (especially memorization), but it is certainly worth the effort.</comment></course>PSY 1008: Impediments to Excelling: Social Threat, Ostracism, Anxiety, and Choking</title>If you're interested in the topic and sports, it be a good class. Prof Seitchik is nice.</comment>Prof. Seitchik is an awesome, down to earth professor. Her expectations are reasonable and class flies by.</comment>Best class I have taken</comment>Take this class! First, the concepts we discuss and learn about are fully applicable to most situations of every day. Second, Prof. Seitchik does a phenomenal job of facilitating great discussions. Third, the readings are manageable and informative enough to build good discussion. Fourth, leading class discussion is actually not bad and great practice for further presentation of research. Lastly, Prof. Seitchik provides excellent feedback on comments and questions, and especially on your preparation of the final paper.</comment>this course was really great. It answered practical questions about how one can tweak his or her habits to succeed in certain evaluative scenarios and posed questions about how interventions can be applied more broadly (i.e. to standardized testing etc.). I really enjoyed this class.</comment>Amazing class.  Favorite course this semester by far.  The class is super relevant to what we all go through and each week is a different topic so I felt like I learned a ton.  Also it isnt a ton of work so you really get to focus on getting into the material and discussing it.</comment>I highly, highly recommend this class. Dr. Seitchik is incredibly knowledgable and great at fostering good discussions. The material is very interesting and applicable to a variety of different situations. I learned a lot from the class and got really good practice in reading articles and coming up with critiques and ideas for new studies from the articles. Overall, it was a pretty minimal course load- there weren't any time-wasting assignments and those that we did have actually really helped me to understand the material better. Take this class if you can!</comment>This class is great. Prof. Seitchik is amazing, and she really knows her stuff.  I do think that instead of being a seminar, this course should've been lecture based because it got a little boring towards the end (mainly because I knew how the class was going to go).</comment></course>HEB 1434: Primate Behavior Lab</title>This is one of the best course you can take in Harvard. First, you get a free membership in the Franklin Park Zoo, and you get to go there a multiple times to collect observational data. If you don't have much research background or experience, this is the great course to make your own hypothesis of interest, actually go to the zoo to collect behavioral data, use statistical analysis to test your hypothesis, and write a research paper and make a poster as well.</comment></course>EXPOS 20.142: Jane Austen, Then and Now</title>This class is a lot of work. I enjoyed it overall, but sometimes had to spend quite a lot of time on assignments. I really liked reading Austen books and watching movies based on the novels! Some of the expos required aspects of the course were somewhat boring (especially the hours spent studying citations), but these aspects are required in all expos classes. Overall, I recommend this class!</comment>You will not be graded easily but as long as you like Jane Austen writing your papers and doing your research will actually be very enjoyable. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend this course.</comment>Unless you are extremely passionate and familiar with Jane Austen, this class can be difficult and frustrating. This class requires a considerable amount of time and is definitely not one of the easier Expos classes. Being a literature Expos, I would also not recommend it for those who are interested in studying the sciences or other fields outside of literature.</comment>Really work with your teacher on discussing your essays and strategies. They are more than willing to help and give great advice one-on-one.</comment>You have to take it, and it's also helpful for learning how to write at Harvard.</comment>To make sure that they actually have an interest in Jane Austen, and to be prepared for lots of writing assignments.</comment>I couldn't imagine a better writing teacher than Tess. She's truly an inspiration to me every day.</comment>If you enjoy Austen, it's an excellent class to explore her works while learning how to write analytically.</comment>To enjoy this course you need to love the study of Jane Austen, merely enjoying her books was not enough for me. The teacher expects you to work a lot for this class and you should expect deadlines that are not on days when the class meets, this includes weekend deadlines. I would only recommend this course to someone who is considering concentrating in English or Literature as it has very little material that will be useful in other disciplines. This class is also not discussion based. If you take this course use office hours and tell Tess exactly what you need help with, she will help you and I think sees this as a priority.</comment></course>CELLBIO 306qc: Teaching 100: The Theory and Science of Teaching</title>Great material and an important topic - really eye opening about how teaching is, can, and should be done. Course is somewhat meandering and assignments aren't always clearly explicated.</comment>Good content, but less organized than it should be (especially given that teaching is all about time management.)</comment>If you expect to teach in any capacity in your career, a course like this should be mandatory.</comment>As someone with no background in education whatsoever I found this course to be particularly interesting as an introduction to ideas related to course curriculum design.</comment></course>AFRAMER 90r.a: Amharic</title>The class is relaxed, Gashe Mulugeta is a wonderful teacher who cares about his students!</comment>You can learn a lot about the Ethiopian culture.</comment>Take this class. Great way to learn an amazing language</comment></course>ENG-SCI 220: Fluid Dynamics</title>This is a good introduction to many concepts in fluid dynamics, but I honestly don't think it will end up helping much with my future endeavors. I would only recommend it if you have a very strong math background and strong interest in the topics.</comment>Important to be self-disciplined because no graded psets! Good to find a study group or partner to go over pset answers. Topics sometimes seem scattered and it takes awhile for it to come together. The exams tend to be a fair bit more straightforward</comment>You get as much out of the class as you put in. If you don't do the readings or the homework you are likely to walk away without much understanding, but if you put in the time you can learn a lot.</comment>Great selection of topics, imho. Prof Rice has a wonderful personality, which makes the course casual and enjoyable.</comment>It is applicable to other areas of physics, but hard to find another class like this where it is all in one place.</comment>Need to put a lot of time reading book and solving problems for each week's problem discussion.</comment></course>E-PSCI 52: Introduction to Global Geophysics</title>Jerry is not only a very knowledgable instructor, but also a very entertaining one. The lectures were very informative and leave you excited for the next class. Even if this course will not fill as a requirement, I would recommend it with enthusiasm!</comment>Take this class. It's literally the best EPS class I've ever taken.</comment>This is a fantastic course that you should definitely take. First of all, Jerry is literally the best professor I have had at Harvard. He becomes personally invested in each student and always is available to talk about class or anything that strikes your fancy. Also, Harriet is the nicest TF on Harvard's campus; she is super helpful with the psets and review materials.  The workload in this class is totally bearable. You get 4 problem sets due two weeks apart and one midterm and a final project. It is not very work intensive, but you do end up learning a lot without the stress of constant work.   Even if you think you might not be interested in geophysics or solid earth dynamics, you will find yourself thoroughly engaged and interested during each lecture. I found a whole new appreciation for earth science and geophysics in particular after this course, and plan to study the topic further while at Harvard.</comment>This class is absolutely incredible, probably the best class that I've ever taken at Harvard. The teaching staff really cares about its students; by that I mean that they're really excited about the material, and do their best to provide support to the students. You cover a broad range of geophysical topics, and while you learn the derivations of a lot of concepts, you're testing on the general understanding of each phenomena. I took the class in conjunction with EPS 21 (several other students did this) and found that each complemented the other very well. Do not take the geology or physics requirements to be intimidating.</comment>In this course you will learn lots of great stuff about many processes that keep the earth working.</comment>Amazing class.  Not a huge workload, but you still learn a ton.  Rare class where you're not slammed with work but still learn a ton just by sitting in lecture.  Definitely take this class, has been my favorite at Harvard.</comment>Jerry is an amazing professor. The material is really fascinating and he knows an incredible amount about the field of earth science as a whole. It's tough material but really worthwhile.</comment>This isn't an easy course by any means, but Jerry and Harriett are more than happy to help you understand the material outside of class.</comment>Jerry is a great lecturer and the topics are well-explained. The problem sets are very relevant to what is taught in class but can be difficult at times. However, both Jerry and Harriet put a lot of effort into their class and into making themselves available to help.</comment>Jerry and Harriet are excellent teachers. The class is very relaxed and enjoyable, but you learn a lot if you pay attention.</comment>It's well-taught. You will leave with a good understanding of introductory geophysics concepts. Simple mathematical laws are derived and used, but, overall, don't expect to leave with a deep understanding of the material in the course. Professor Mitrovica and Harriet are both very charismatic people who want you to do well and will help you if you are struggling in any area of the course.</comment></course>ETH-REASON 15: "If There is No God, All is Permitted:" Theism and Moral Reasoning</title>I feel like I've learned a lot, though its hard to tell with this type of class. Ultimately its extremely thought provoking and a great impetus for discussion. However, its not just an easy gen ed, only take it if you really want to read the thinkers and learn.</comment>This course is a great in-depth introduction to moral philosophy. There are a lot of readings, but you'll be enriched by every one of them.</comment>Taking this class is a great way to get a feel for the schools of thought relating to morality and God. The class is also not dominated by a single religion or view on God, which makes for some very interesting discussions, and no one feeling singled out. Excellent course.</comment>Questions of religion and spirituality affect so many peoples' lives and a course like this really prepares you to interact with people from a variety of backgrounds. This is an amazing course with a fantastic reading list that will teach you how to reason through questions of moral agency and decision-making. The TF, Michael, is absolutely amazing at helping you see the crux of these philosophers' arguments and giving you the tools to come to your own conclusions. Awesome experience, highly recommended.</comment>This is one of those courses that draws in people who have an incredibly overinflated opinion of themselves. The discussion is dominated by two or three people who believe that they know more than thousands of years of thinking. It becomes incredibly tedious after a while.</comment>This is an interesting course, but be prepared to engage with some heavy reading.</comment>Do the readings. DO THEM.</comment>Jay Harris is a great lecturer and the course material is interesting, definitely more so than most ethical reasoning Gen-Eds. It's really not that difficult (you can get by without doing most of the readings), but you can get a lot out of it if you actually read. Good Ethical Reasoning gen ed, don't expect this course to figure your life out for you.</comment>This course is not an "easy" gen-ed. It definitely required a lot of thought and there is a lot of reading. However, it is a really interesting course and I recommend taking it if you are at all interested in religion or philosophy. It gives you a good survey of some important thinkers that everyone should probably read.</comment>Michael is an awesome TF, and the class makes you have to think and focus in ways I did not have to before. There's a lot to read, but discussions are worthwhile and there aren't many assignments.</comment>This class can feel poorly organized at times, though you will certainly learn a considerable amount.</comment>This course is to be taken seriously. Michael is a very helpful TF, and unlike most, really does read every word of what you write (or at least gives you the illusion). Fascinating discussions; lectures were more like lively arguments between Prof. Harris playing a number of roles (as Hume, Kant, Nietzsche, etc) and us students.</comment>I'm guessing this is one of the better ER courses that are available. Prof. Harris is absolutely wonderful — a really engaging professor. I've never really enjoyed lectures more. He's also done this enough that the course is a well-oiled machine, at least in terms of topics and material. It's definitely harder than the other ERs, but it's also more satisfying, since it's not just someone standing up lecturing about how important justice is. I really really enjoyed it.</comment>Take this class. Professor Harris and Michael are both amazing people who care deeply about the material and about their students. If you spend much of your free time discussing theology, morality, or the questions of religion with your friends anyways, take this class.</comment>This class is not your everyday Gen Ed, although to his credit Prof. Harris is vocal about this and lets folks know what he expects from the get go. He expects the best work out of you and you have to do the readings AND really understand them to do well in the course.</comment>An amazing opportunity to push yourself and your ethical thinking out of your comfort zone and into a much stronger more reflective territory.</comment>It's more work than I expected, but I'm really glad I read the works we did as part of my general education background in life.</comment>This class is an excellent Gen-Ed. It may require more reading than most other ER Gen-Eds, but all the works you read are worth reading, and besides the reading, there is not much work (two papers and a final). Prof. Harris really cares about the students' feedback and wishes for the class, and Michael was awesome; he really cared about his students and their personal journeys of wrestling with the questions of God and morality.</comment>Definitely take it. It's often a lot of work, but certainly worth the time and effort.</comment>This is certainly not a light gen ed. If you want to get away with taking an easy course, this isn't the one for you. But if you are at all interested in philosophy, this is really a great course! Yes, it is pretty difficult, there are lots of readings and the readings are challenging, but the class discussions are very interesting and section is incredible. Only 2 papers and a final, and the papers are very flexible. You will have to put in more work than other gen eds but the course is rewarding and, at the end of the semester, looking back at the stack of books you read, you will certainly feel smarter for it.</comment>This is one of the most intellectual classes on campus. Professor Harris is one of the best around, and if you feel concerned about taking an Ethical Reasoning class, you should definitely take one that he teaches. There is a lot of reading and you will often be confused, but realize that everyone else is and there is no "right" answer.</comment>The syllabus is great, and if it were just the posted lectures, it would be amazing! But there's something about the class and the material that brings out every single section kid you can think of who will pause when he is called on to speak and go on some rant that ends with, "..and I find this philosopher deeply unsatisfactory." Furthermore, the sections usually end in discussion from the same few voices who seem very agitated.</comment></course>CLASPHIL 225: Pindar</title>Helpful to have research projects and ideas already in progress on Pindar or Greek literature which one can bring to the class as a kind of workshop and improve upon.</comment>This course boasts a very broad approach, and the professor is very willing to engage with a wide range of cultural products and scholarly methodologies.</comment></course>MATH 152: Discrete Mathematics</title>Fantastic way to fill Applied Math requirement</comment>This class is an extremely good introduction to higher-level math topics. It gives a very good overview of group theory (as well as many other important topics). It is taught seminar-style, with students presenting topics at the board during class, so be prepared to not sit and be lectured, for better or worse. The class is small and moves at whatever speed is appropriate for the students. Paul will often include or exclude topics depending on what the class wants. Midterms and final are very fair, and problem sets are very reasonable. If you've only taken Math 21 (or not even that), have no proof experience, and are considering higher-level math courses or a Math/AM concentration, this class is perfect.</comment>Take this course! Paul is an endlessly interesting professor. You will come out of this course having learnt a variety of topics in surprising depth. Not very challenging, but very interesting nonetheless. Good second or third math class. Covers very important mathematical concepts.</comment>This class is great. If you're a little hesitant about taking a math class and what that's all about this is the class for you. The pace is set by the students but that doesn't mean the class isn't demanding and rewarding. It is challenging but accessible. Classes are engaging and instructive. One of my favorite classes at harvard so far.</comment>Very enjoyable, fun, and easy math course. Great way to be exposed to multiple areas of abstract math while learning how to present math. If you did well in 23+ maybe consider 122 though for a more serious introduction to group theory.</comment>This is a great chance to learn in a small, seminar style environment some interesting, new, but not overwhelmingly difficult, material in abstract/discrete math. Also you get practice presenting on the whiteboard.</comment>Some busy work but you learn some really interesting math that underlies a lot of the stuff you already know. If you like math and just think it's cool to think about you'll love this class</comment></course>NEUROBIO 101hff: Seeing Time in the Brain</title>Its a good class that has a minimal workload and laid back atmosphere. Just make sure you read and participate in discussions every week.</comment>This tutorial demands a little more time and effort than other neuro tutorials (weekly questions aren't easy), and the grading is certainly tougher. However, the subject matter is interesting and Patrick is great guy. This has been my favorite class and I'd highly recommend it.</comment>A really interesting and unique topic in neuroscience. Really makes me think about how I think about time in general and how it is encoded in my brain, as well as how much more there is to be discovered about time in the brain.</comment>If you want to take an interesting neuroscience course, or need to take a neuroscience tutorial, think strongly about taking this course!! P. Mayo is very dedicated to the course, and the material is very interesting -- how does the brain encode time?</comment>Highly engaging class, personal attention, enjoyable class discussions</comment>I could not recommend this class more strongly! Patrick is awesome and the material is really interesting.</comment></course>COMPSCI 182: Intelligent Machines: Reasoning, Actions, and Plans</title>Interesting material and Prof Grosz is such a passionate teacher. :-) It's also not so difficult for a CS course.</comment>Decent class. The professor and the TFs care a lot and are pretty available.   The lectures are difficult to stay present for the entire time.   The midterms are pretty time-crunched.</comment>If you thought CS 124 gave you a lot of computational "tools" to add to your computational "toolbox," you should definitely see CS 182 as a course that will help you do the same! As an Applied Math - CS person, this was kind of a part 2 of CS 124 for me; a lot of algorithms that in 124 you see run in exponential time, you will explore better ways of improving those algorithms and tackling those problems in this class. The class was a bit of a reach for me in terms of difficulty, but if you're confident you can find a partner who will help you get through those bumps, you will grow a lot in this class!!</comment>The first part of this class is what I had hoped CS124 to be. They take you through different algorithms like BFS, DFS, A*, UCS, IDS, IDA* and make sure you can implement them. Then you get to learn some of the newer algorithms used in AI. These were explained pretty well and if not, material was available to us to learn them. The lectures were a bit too dry and theoretical in my opinion. The high point of lectures was when we actually got a chance to apply what we were learning and do practice problems in class. Prof. Grosz then walked us through the solution. I think more CS classes should try this out as this is what actually helps students learn more than lecturing. Fair warning about the class: after the first half, the class becomes pretty abstract and it is hard to see where the applications are. If you are looking to get into research, this would be a great class to take.</comment>The material is fairly interesting, but be aware that it's somewhat of a hodgepodge/overview of the field. I'd recommend it to freshman and sophomores who want an overview of AI before taking more specific courses like CS181, CS187 etc. Don't be scared by the prerequisites, you don't need them in my view.</comment>This is the most applicable CS class I took - I could really see how it relates to real world problems. It made for a fun and meaningful project as well. The course staff is so supporting and Prof. Grosz really cares about her students! Take it!</comment>This is a great introduction to AI. The professor is a great lecturer. Sections are pretty helpful but not mandatory. Assignments are pretty fun.</comment>definitely not a grueling cs course, and you learn some interesting basic AI concepts. a lot of course materials are borrowed from the berkeley curriculum, which is pretty solid.</comment>This was an amazing class--take it!</comment>This class is a great intro to AI. It delves into several different areas, with interesting discussions about the current state of AI. Coursework is very manageable, and assignments are actually fun to do.</comment>You get to program Pacman!</comment>CS 182 is great class! I learned a lot about the theory and practice of AI, and enjoyed my experience the course. I think it is accessible to students with a wide range of backgrounds and comfort with CS.</comment>Reasonable workload, fun project. Don't expect to learn a ton of interesting theory though.</comment>This is a terrific class! You learn a lot and you get to work on a great project! Professor Grosz made the class very interactive and tried hard to foster a sense of community. The class has a reasonable workload, and it is what you make of it in terms of how much you can learn. Great introduction to AI!</comment>This course is pretty easy and not that challenging. The hardest part is dragging yourself to classes which move pretty slowly and don't let you use your laptop or do anything to break the monotony. That being said, Grosz is fantastically nice and the course staff genuinely care about the material.</comment>This course is based on really interesting subject material and can be extended in a lot of interesting and cool ways. Being comfortable with Python will be helpful but not necessary when you are coming into the class.</comment>Have a strong CS background because a lot of previous knowledge is assumed.</comment>While the ideas in this course are engaging and fascinating, especially for those interested in Artificial Intelligence, I found myself disappointed by the consistent lack of support and disorganization in this course. The problem sets were perhaps my favorite aspect of the course, and many of them were slight modifications of assignments from another intro to AI course. While the iSites had a page for assignment solutions, none were ever posted. Lectures and lecture notes were quite helpful in summarizing and as an overview of the material, but were never particularly engaging or exciting. Students were generally left to fill in the details through the readings, which was perfectly reasonable, but again quite dry. I would suggest that those who choose to take this course be certain they are interested enough in the material to engage themselves.</comment>CS182 provides a great overview about Artificial Intelligence.  The teaching staff is great and the content is good.  On the other hand, the pacing of the course is a bit awkward and I do not agree with some of the course policies  (e.g. no laptops in class) but the teaching staff is receptive to ideas and I believe the course will improve overtime.</comment>I don't understand why so many people told me this class was "meh" or "bad". I loved this class! If you think beyond what you're being told in lecture, the material can be applied to a huge variety of problems. For example, if you can turn your problem into a graph problem, you'll have a toolbox of algorithms to apply. If you figure out a function that tells you how "good" a given solution to your problem is, you'll have a bunch of algorithms for finding an optimal solution.  I directly used some material from this class on interviews I had for software positions as well.

The only part that was difficult to apply was First Order Logic, but most of the other material was very useful. I'd definitely recommend this class for anyone interested in efficient and applicable problem solving techniques. If you're looking for lots of theory and proofs of algorithms, however, then this isn't the class for you.

The guest lectures are great.

Also, I'm pretty sure you don't need CS 121 (I didn't take it, and many others didn't when we had a class survey). I don't recall having to prove anything by induction in this class. The only CS 121 material we really used was logic (I think that's covered in CS 121 or CS 20?), but it's not too difficult to pick up if you go to office hours or spend some time self-studying it. The CS 20 textbook (it's free, just look at CS 20's website) covers the basics pretty well.

The final project is fun. Just give your group time to finish it and DO NOT try to do it all in a couple of days. The writeup matters as much as if not more than your implementation. Make sure you spend time on it and read it over so it makes perfect sense.</comment>Not sure why this class has historically gotten mediocre Q-reviews. It is organized, not crazy in terms of workload, and the material is very interesting and relevant. Would especially recommend taking this as one of the CS electives. Also, Ofra is an awesome TF!</comment>Very interesting course with a great lecturer (Gosz) and a very helpful and engaged teaching staff. The course is not too difficult but some of the assignments can take a long time to finish. In any case, a great course that include many important and interesting topics from introductory artificial intelligence.</comment>I decided to take this course because AI seems like a really interesting topic. When you complete the course you'll probably find AI to be fairly tedious and realize that most of the solutions we have so far aren't particularly good. The course is taught pretty well, but the material just isn't that interesting, so I can't recommend this class highly.</comment></course>ITAL 40: Advanced Oral Expression and Performance</title>It's a great way to practice your Italian if you're shy about your Italian speaking skills. Professoressa Di Fabio is amazing, and I would highly recommend the class.</comment>Italian 40 might seem intimidating because it requires performing or presenting in front of other people in a language that is not one's own. Still, definitely take it if Professoressa DiFabio is teaching it. This course has been one of the more transformative for me personally because it put me outside of my comfort zone but enabled me to grow from that experience, and isn't that what education is really about?</comment>Italian 40 is great! Prof. DiFabio is so engaging and thoughtful, and she structures the class to focus on improvement with the freedom to take risks rather than anything too intimidating. If you're not interested in performing short pieces of literature, you might not love this class, but Prof. DiFabio helps you to learn a lot while you bring these pieces to life. There's an unfortunate handful of reading comprehension assignments on linguistics (in Italian), but overall, the course is fun, the professor is helpful, and it's worthwhile to learn about pronunciation, oral performance, and great Italian literature all in one.</comment>Be prepared for some frustration at first when your pronunciation is nit-picked, often in front of your fellow students. You'll get used to it soon enough, and before long you'll find that your recitation has improved significantly.</comment></course>ENG-SCI 190: Introduction to Materials Science and Engineering</title>Worst class I've taken.</comment>The iteration of this class with Prof. Spaepen was really hard--much harder than in previous years. However, it was also really rewarding. The book of lecture slides is what we were tested on on the final, so it's really helpful to know everything in it.</comment>If Spaepen is teaching this class DO NOT TAKE IT. Create a scheduling conflict and try to take it at MIT. This is literally the worst class I have ever taken at Harvard.</comment>This is definitely the most difficult class I've taken at Harvard, and I've taken a number of difficult ones. It's difficult both in terms of conceptual understanding and workload. Imagine surveying the whole field of chemistry and the whole field of physics in one course. Not just intro chemistry and intro physics. The whole field; both fields. That's ES190. There is very little guidance on how to psets because lecture doesn't actually cover any examples. Everyone is thrown into the deep end on this one. Don't take this course. To put my recommendation in perspective: I've now taken 28 courses, and I would recommend against only 3 total. This is one of them. Don't take this. You've been warned.</comment>Only took this course as it was a requirement. The pace was unreasonable for undergrads. Spaepen definitely knows the material, but he needs to do a much better job in decreasing the speed in which he goes through the notes.  The handwriting in the notes is also not that easy to decipher. The TFs weren't too helpful at first, but improved later on. Spaepen can be extremely condescending, especially during office hours or even during class when you ask him a question that he believes you should know as a "mechanical engineer" student. Psets were brutal since we never had been given an example problems to use for the concepts that he covered in class. He also believes a lot in having students memorize derivations, and I don't think that that is practical for the real world when you can look up most of these formulas.</comment>I want to be nice because Spaepen tries, he really tries.  But he was so disconnected from reality that learning anything was a challenge. He seems shocked whenever we don't know something about materials science, teaching everything in the class as though we already know it.  The basic strategy of teaching where you develop a strong foundation in the basics before moving onto advanced concepts seems to be totally lost.  The class notes are unreadable and as hard to follow as the lectures.  I was not taught materials science.  I taught myself.  This class can in no way take credit for my learning.  I learned in spite of it.</comment>This is the hardest class I have ever taken (and I've already survived a lot of engineering classes). The course moved so fast, and we basically covered 3 MIT courses worth of material. I wish I had secretary experience, because maybe then I would have been able to read the messy cursive handwriting of the professor that filled 300+ pages of a handwritten "book." That thing gave me a headache. Take this class if you want to spend 30 hours a week drowning in the darkness of ignorance and enduring repeated emotional and mental despair. Also, if I had a penny for every time the professor said, "You already know this, so I'll skip it," then I would be a millionaire. Unfortunately, I didn't know any of the things he skipped, and I never learned them either.</comment>Overall, this class was a very negative experience, which felt like drinking through a fire hose. The material is difficult, and little effort were made to actually explain concepts clearly. Students were not given that much support on homework and class materials in general. Do not take if it is not required of you to take.</comment>The material is very difficult to understand, but the actual workload is quite reasonable.  The more time you spend reading over the notes and working through the concepts until you could explain them yourself, the better you will do on the tests.  Your percentage grades will be low, but difficult problems create great learning opportunities.</comment></course>ENG-SCI 276: Introduction to MicroElectroMechanical System</title>This is a great class! A lot of what I learned will be applicable to my research.</comment></course>GOV 1243: Russian Politics in Transition</title>This course is suitable for beginners and people already familiar with Russia alike. People of all experience levels are likely to get something positive out of the course.</comment>The subject matter is really interesting, and Prof. Colton has a lot of cool stories to share. He's seen/met a lot of the things/people discussed in the class. The readings are manageable (never exceeded ~100 pp a week), and are well selected. Lectures can sort of drag on, but it's worth it.</comment>This is a great course if you are interested in Russia. You are given a lot of information in lecture and readings and it is very enjoyable if you want to learn about the various aspects of Russian politics and society!</comment>If you are even slightly interested in Russia take this course. If you are even slightly interested in government take this course. If you are even remotely curious about geopolitics today take this course. I have thoroughly enjoyed my experience in this course, and am walking away with a completely new understanding of the modern Russian Federation and its politics.</comment>A must if you're interested in global affairs and/or Russia. Colton is great.</comment>Speaking Russian helps, but not mandatory</comment></course>SYSTBIO 204: Biomolecular Engineering and Synthetic Biology</title>A great overview of synthetic biology. There is a definite focus on DNA nanotechnology but it is overall a good class.</comment>Excellent Course! Provided such insightful breakthroughs of current state of DNA nanotechnology and synthetic biology (genome engineering).</comment>Best course of my life...outstanding coverage of advanced and cutting edge topics that is flourishing in this academic community.</comment>Too much DNA nanotechnology, but still a solid course.</comment>It is a nice setting for getting to know the current state of the art of many diverse field in synthetic biology.</comment>Fun.</comment>Good class but you get out of it what you put in. If you're not too excited / interested, maybe shy away.</comment>Extremely interesting, engaging, close look at synthetic biology mostly as it's done at the Wyss. Fantastic opportunity to learn directly from instructors who are conducting the cutting-edge science you're learning about, have guest lectures from leaders in their various fields, work with developers of the software you're using, etc. etc. That said, very low stress and low time commitment. At times the lack of expectations makes it feel less like a class and more like a cool lecture series. You get out of it what you put into it. Would be great for first-year grad students interested in seeing some of the really neat research happening around Harvard and MIT.</comment>This class is really what makes Harvard great. Nothing beats learning about cutting edge breakthroughs in synthetic biology directly from the researchers doing it. The lectures are captivating and informative, and the instructors actually really care about our learning the material. Fresh coffee and pastries every class doesn't hurt either :)</comment>Take it to get inspired and explore a new field. Don't expect a traditional classroom experience or any feedback on your work. This is more of a seminar course.</comment>Amazing way to explore creative applications of biology, and invent some ideas of your own</comment>Amazing class. Definitely one of the best I have taken at Harvard.</comment></course>LING 200: Second Language Acquisition</title>The intentions behind this course are noble but in practice it's just not as helpful as it's meant to be. Steven is a great and knowledgeable professor and structured a really rich and stimulating course, and yet, most of us felt that it overwhelmed us more than it actually helped us, as these evaluations will surely corroborate. The number of assignments, while meant to replace a midterm and final, ended up being far too excessive given that most of us were teaching for the first time and preparing for our general exams. But what good will this advice do since you'll just be forced to take this unhelpful class anyway? I will say that Steven's insistence on defending cognitive linguistics/outdated pedagogical practices was a bit off-putting and got a little annoying after a while. We understand that it's his field but most if not all of us came in hoping to learn the most cutting-edge theories and approaches and were ultimately disappointed. That said, Steven's focus on professionalization was welcome and insightful. Hopefully your experience will be more helpful and less disappointing than it was for this year's LING 200 cohort...</comment>Very good introduction to linguistics and pedagogy.</comment></course>MODGRK 100: Advanced Modern Greek: Introduction to Modern Greek Literature</title>This is a great class. You will learn a great deal about Seferis and Prof. Rapti will be a great resource in the process. I highly recommend taking this class.</comment>Vassiliki and her staff are great. I always felt that I got proper support in this class, and I did end up learning a lot about both George Seferis and Greek history. It can be a bit difficult for a student not fully fluent in Greek, but the teaching staff will be certain to help you out.</comment></course>EASTD 98b: Junior Tutorial--Japan and the World</title>If you are interested in Japan, contemplating writing a thesis on Japan, or just want to learn more about contemporary Japanese issues, definitely take this course! Professor Pharr is amazingly knowledgeable and very approachable--her points on the various themes are very cool to listen to! Also, she gives great advice on all sorts of things related to Japan, work, school-- beyond just material in the tutorial--which is also amazing.   The themes covered are definitely some of the major contemporary issues that Japan faces now, from the history problem (textbooks, Yasukuni shrine, comfort women) to issues of immigrants and women in the workforce. Lots of great topics and themes are covered, so give it a shot!</comment>This course is run in an unusual manner: you have a lecture from Professor Pharr, an amazing individual and scholar of Japan, for an hour before transitioning to section. If it was just lecture, I would give the course a 5, or if Professor Pharr taught section it would be a 5. Unfortunately, section pulled it down a lot, though the section leader probably changes year to year, so I would still recommend the course.   Pluses: -fascinating range of topics and issues examined (really—I could talk for years about all the interesting problems that Japan faces that the course introduces you to) -Professor Pharr is incredibly knowledgeable and encouraging -Lots of support and help while writing the research paper -Thoughtful feedback on writing  To improve the course, I would cut out the section component and allow Professor Pharr to teach the entire course. It is a bit jarring to weekly have to switch instructors in the middle of each class meeting, especially when they have very different styles. Professor Pharr is frankly more knowledgeable about the subjects than a teaching fellow could be, and I would love to see future classes be taught entirely by her.  Section, as I said, was unfortunately a letdown. Though I felt we had some good discussions, there was little direction and I felt like we often rambled. Additionally, there was not much enthusiasm put into the section and I felt like the energy came more from the students than from the instructor. The students were great and very interested in the material, which made it bearable most of the time.  Overall though, it's a good course, but it was frustrating that its incredible potential was brought down by section.  I learned about many of the societal, historical, and political issues that modern Japan faces. These will inform me as I continue my study of East Asia and have definitely shaped the way I approach the region.   I also worked on my social science writing, with which I did not have much prior experience. I am grateful for the feedback I received, which was thoughtful and helpful.</comment>The TF will truly dictate how a student's experience will be. Prof. Pharr is a guaranteed 5</comment>Professor Pharr is a fantastic teacher, and this course is an excellent overview of very current issues in the social scientific study of Japan!</comment>This is definitely a course for anyone who wants to learn more about Japanese issues. It's definitely a lot of reading but each one is relevant to the topic. You also connect all the readings through short papers throughout the semester. But this class will take a lot of time if you really want to do well and participate.</comment>Even if you are only moderately interested in East Asia or Japan, take this course, because Professor Pharr is an effective lecturer and an amazing professor get to know personally. You will definitely have fun learning so much (breadth and depth) about a single nation.</comment></course>SOC-STD 98eo: Culture and Society</title>The readings are great, and the discussions have a ton of potential. Adatto is also so kind and excited to help you.</comment>Though the course materials cover a diverse range of topics, they're often covered only on a surface level. The course load is also quite large, considering the weekly response papers and good deal of reading required. Overall good, but not as amazing as its Q score might suggest</comment>Even though this class is a lot of work, it is totally worth it. All of the readings and viewings were so incredibly useful/interesting.</comment>At first I thought this course would be really interesting but by the third week, it was fairly boring. The readings were okay, definitely things I wouldn't have known otherwise, but Adatto and the discussion were pretty weak. I think the course needs to focus more on certain ideas, it's a bit too much breadth.</comment>this class has a lot of breadth, but not a lot of depth. if you are coming out of Social Studies 10 looking for a junior tutorial that challenges your convictions and views as much as Social Studies 10, then this is not that class. No philosophy to be found here... but in terms of a class that gives you an interesting perspective and cross-section on the components of culture, it's pretty good</comment>This is a great tutorial. Kiku is very enthusiastic and knowledgable about the subject matter, and gives great feedback and flexibility for research paper ideas, so if your topic of interest relates at all to culture & society you should take this. The weekly response papers were difficult and graded strictly (though you get a chance to rewrite them), but I appreciated this as it ensured I actually did the readings. Also, we watched Waltz with Bashir in class!</comment></course>ENGLISH 98r: Tutorial - Junior Year</title>Reading one new American short story author each week is amazing! Having that kind of focus really nails down the essentials to what short fiction is. And it also gave me the enthusiasm to start tracing my own interests in short fiction.</comment>If you want to learn, truly learn, take this class. While the workload may seem overly demanding at first, after 3 or 4 weeks you find the natural rhythm of the class. This class is unlike anything I've ever taken from the department--both in what it demanded of me and what I got out of it. I can't recommend it enough. I think also, compared to some of the other tutorials, this tutorial provides far more scope than just critical analysis and close reading. Take this tutorial and you will grow immensely as a student, thankful for Matthew Ocheltree and the discussions he engendered.</comment>Michael is a talented teacher, and extremely smart. The material is a great introduction to 20th century American poetry.</comment>This class was one of my favorites that I have taken at Harvard.</comment>Michael is a great tutor. He facilitates discussion well, is always enthusiastic, and always has a lot to say about the readings. You'll learn a lot about contemporary poetry and the issues involved.</comment>John is an incredible tutor, and the material is fantastic! Take this class.</comment>This class is not easy. It's pretty intensive- a lot of reading, and writing the drafts is not fun, as much as you might love your topic. Having said that, this is meant to be an intensive class to give you a taste of what thesis-ing senior year might be like, so while it was painful at times, it was necessary. Besides these structural things, the actual content of the classes was extremely enjoyable (for the most part...ugh, Pound), and Matt was a phenomenal instructor that made learning about a heavy topic really fascinating and memorable. Overall, the english junior tutorial class itself is rough, but necessarily so. World War I lit + any class with Matt is amazing.</comment>It really was difficult in the sense that there was a lot of work, but intensely rewarding and educational.  You should attempt to make room in your schedule to focus on this class by taking a lighter courseload.</comment>The junior tutorial is one of the hardest classes i've taken at harvard. it is also the most rewarding. it changed how i think about not just theory but about literature in general. The small class size made it fun and accessible, and the weekly meetings during the writing process helped me produce a paper i am really proud of. If you love critical writing, i would highly recommend this course.</comment>If you can take any class during your undergraduate career, make it a class with John Radway.</comment>The course material was so interesting and Rebecca is a great teacher!</comment>This is the ideal English class. The small class size (my class at 5 students was considered large) and dedicated guidance of the tutor allow you to engage with the materials and topic at a deeper level than I have found in any other class taken at Harvard. The seminar is 50% reading and discussion and 50% writing and research. Whatever interests you come into the seminar with, make them known in the first meeting so that the tutor can help guide your independent reading and research in a direction you'll love. That being said, challenge yourself by taking a seminar that isn't perfectly aligned with your comfort-zone. I discovered the joys of Dramatic Modernism this semester, and am now seriously reconsidering my senior thesis research. Above all, this course has given me an appreciation for a genre I never thought I'd enjoy, but now am seeking out in my spare time. You should find a seminar that you want to put before all other classwork. This reading and research should come first, and the more time you spend with this class early in the semester, the more you will get out of it by the end. You need to develop a good working relationship with your tutor from the start, so go to office hours, ask to meet outside of class, and email, email, email. Also, know that the syllabus isn't set in stone and will mold to your interests and needs as an academic, just so long as you make you voice your concerns.</comment></course>ANTHRO 1804: Tasting Food: Politics, Science and the Senses</title>This course inspired some really fascinating discussions in class and outside of class. The reading material was great, too. Really really enjoyed this class and strongly recommend it!</comment>really fun and interesting class. different from most other classes taken at harvard!</comment>This class is amazing- but only if you truly care about the topics and want to invest time in deeply discussing specific points of food.</comment>Strongly recommended, you will really enjoy the class and taste real food throughout the semester!</comment>This is a great class -- it provides an interesting discourse around the culture and anthropology of food. The professor is very insightful and curates a top notch set of topics to discuss. Definitely take it if Nico is still around!</comment>It was probably the class that I enjoyed the most this semester, because the professor, the students, the content, and the atmosphere for discussion all worked very well together. If the topic is of any interest to you, I would highly recommend it!</comment>If you're interested in food, this course will give you a great view on the social sciences analysis of food-related issues. Nico is a friendly, knowledgable professor and I had a great time in the course!</comment></course>FRSEMR 41t: Modernity, Society, and the Novel</title>This class is really interesting and challenges one to think in different ways about society and social constructs and constraints. Prof. Malczewski is very open to discussing just about anything from the point of view which is developed throughout the course of the class. Novels are read more for their value in understanding the society in which the characters live than for plot or character development, etc.</comment>Eric makes it a priority to know everybody in the class and it shows in the quality of discussions. Just be aware that this is as much a sociology class as it is a literature class, as the novels are meant to be read as historical artifacts of their times. That said, you also get to tie the themes of the class back to your own life: the issues that nationalism raises for questions of identity and character are issues that every college student will have to grapple with. If you do the readings and participate in the discussions, you will come away with a better grasp on how to read novels and tie them back to your own understanding of the world.</comment>A very involved, interesting, and enjoyable class. Every week, the seminar was something I could really look forward to going to.</comment></course>ESPP 78: Environmental Politics</title>The ESPP department has a wonderful sense of community and the TAs really helped us to get to know each other. The readings are so thoughtfully chosen - they help you to understand so much about environmental politics - do them! (Regularly!) And enjoy the final paper - it was a really special opportunity to learn about a case study in depth.</comment>Valuable course if you desire to be a knowledgeable citizen.</comment>This was a truly phenomenal class. It covered complex topics in a nuanced but deep way. All components were well done: the lectures, the sections (really great), the readings. I came away with a feeling that I learned something important in this course. Something not only important for my academic development, but something important for my future contributions to our world.</comment>This course is a lot of work, but definitely worth it. I would recommend for someone who has taken an ESPP course as it does build nicely on other courses. This is a great class for anyone who cares about environmental issues.</comment>This is absolutely one of my favorite classes I have taken at Harvard. However, I think your enjoyment/appreciation of this class really depends on how much you put into it. I had a light semester and was able to do all of the readings and therefore all the lectures were really interesting to me, but I can see how they might be a little dry if you don't do the readings. That being said you SHOULD take this and do the readings because it is material you'll want to have understood for the rest of our life as we tackle these problems globally. Sheila is on of the most intelligent people I have encountered here and you will certainly learn a tremendous amount from her.</comment>It's incredibly difficult, frustrating (intellectually) and theoretical.</comment>It's a really thought-provoking, broad and in-depth class that encourages some great discussions if you get the right TF. That being said, the exams are a bit funky (it really should be an essay class), and it's completely impossible to do all the reading, but they expect you to be able to reference small details from all of it. FORM A STUDY GROUP, divide the reading, share notes.</comment>This course requires a lot of reading. If you actually do the readings, everything will be easier for you later on in the course (for the midterm and final), and you will also get a lot more out of it.</comment>For those interested in environmental issues, it is a great course to take at Harvard. Though some readings were rather difficult to connect with and often jargony, most were interesting and, in my opinion, the best aspect of the course. Many were disappointed with the lectures, which many found hard to engage with, and oftentimes the class seemed a little disorganized. There were definitely strands throughout the whole course, but I think that the class could do better to connect those strands and not just add them on at the end.</comment>This class has an Incredible amount of required reading. Up to hundreds of pages a week. And it really it required because the format of the midterm and final requires you to remember an absurd amount of detail from any of the readings that were assigned. The best thing you can do for this class is put together a study group that can divide up the readings and then share notes. It isn't a very well organized class which can be frustrating at times and lecture/section are useful, but not really necessary to do well. 
you don't have a study group</comment>Lectures can be tough to follow, and readings are often long and difficult.</comment>Yes, there is a lot of reading. Yes, the lectures can be dry. Yes, there's a lot of theory.

HOWEVER

This course plays such a crucial role in the Harvard curriculum. It's so rare that you can take a class where you read theory about environmental mobilization and then analyze pictures of the People's Climate March. Jasanoff is brilliant and kind. Take this class.</comment>I enjoy delving into environmental politics. However, the material in this particular class was for to technical and jargon-y for my taste, and the lectures were definitely on the boring side. Also, there's a rigid response paper structure that ignores the realities of academic work patterns.</comment>This class is worlds away from ESPP 10, which was one of the best classes I've taken at Harvard, and that's despite being politically more closely aligned with the professor's views. Professor Jasanoff is an expert in the field, but that doesn't make her a particularly interesting lecturer, and the powerpoint slides that accompany them can be impossible to decipher. The readings are occasionally interesting, but extremely long, and the majority are dense. This means that most students will give up trying to do any more than skim them by a few weeks in. If you are simply interested in environmental issues, and don't really like political theory, then I would not recommend this class.</comment>Wonderful class! One of my favorites at Harvard. Take it if you have any interest in politics, sustainability, or the environment. Coming in with a vague, underdeveloped interest in sustainable development, I emerged well-equipped for intelligent discussion on virtually any aspect of the environment (so don't be intimidated if you're not fully up-to-speed on current environmental debates).  Professor Jasanoff is very clever and cares that her students take something away from the course-- which is challenging because it requires you to think, rather than due to a huge amount of work.  I had a lot of fun with the research paper, which is open-ended and let me explore a totally new topic that interested me.  Recommend with enthusiasm.</comment>Making a study group is key to this class. I would highly recommend you split up the readings and then meet to talk about them, or at least share notes.</comment>This class is really about learning new ways to think about environmentalism; how to consider risk, valuation of nature, humans' place in nature, etc.  Be warned that there is a lot of reading, and as always the more you do the more you'll get out.  But go in committed to reading a lot and participating in section, and you'll come out great.</comment>Glad I took it... you can learn a good deal from this class and get by without doing many readings, although I would've liked to do more because a lot of them were very interesting</comment>Take notes of your readings each week!  It will help come essay/test time.</comment>This course is very well structured and organized, and gives you a great overview of environmental politics in the United States as well as the global environmental movement and the interaction of different actors.</comment>Please do not take this course. It is the worst class I've taken at Harvard. The class does not actually teach you to think critically about environmental politics.</comment></course>ENGLISH Cwfr: Introductory Fiction: Workshop</title>if you are looking for a safe space at harvard to work on your creative writing, i highly recommend this class! it was a great opportunity to get to share my work with other students and receive constructive and helpful feedback that I really think helped me as a writer. obviously, the more you put in, you get more out of this class. It's not really that much work, but it really gives you a chance to explore and be creative within an academic setting</comment>If you're reading this, then I'm sorry to say that you have missed the chance to take this course with Amy Hempel, because she is an irreplaceable resource to student writers.</comment>Great class to improve your writing and see other students writing styles!</comment>Creative writing workshops, particularly this one, are SUCH a great addition to any schedule. It's a low-stress but extremely productive environment, and it's a great way to do something creative and fulfilling for academic credit. Amy is absolutely amazing; it's a shame to see her leave Harvard, and I hope whoever takes her place as an additional intro fiction instructor is just as good.</comment></course>ENGLISH 111: Epic: From Homer to Star Wars</title>I cannot recommend this class highly enough!!! Take it as a gen ed or an elective and it's so worth a little extra work. Definitely stay caught up on the readings, it makes the course so much better.</comment>This class was amazing. The pace of the reading can get intense but it's not to bad catching up. I've studied most of the books before but Professor Whittington gave an entirely different perspective on them. Her lectures are very poignant and powerful but she manages to make them funny and interesting as well.</comment>Professor Whittington is the BOMB! Her lectures are great, and she is very invested in her students! The reading is A LOT - but it is all so entertaining that it isn't a hardship. Take this class, even if you are not an English concentrator!</comment>This is an amazing course. The teaching staff is amazing, the material is interesting, and the assignments are reasonable.</comment>Take this class (and go to office hours if you do--Prof. Whittington is amazing!)</comment>This is a wonderful class, especially for a freshman or someone branching out into English or the Humanities for the first time. Professor Whittington is here to help her students. She is very accessible and clearly wants everyone to succeed to the best of their ability. The coursework, lectures, handouts, and review materials are all designed to make the students both enjoy the material and the the most out of it. The readings are manageable, and the so are the two essays. It is a great mix of structure and freedom. Again, it is a wonderful introduction to some truly amazing texts and English classes at Harvard in general.</comment>The course has a lot of reading (probably 150-200) pages per week, but it is all worth it.  If you're not going to do the reading, just don't waste your time.  Professor Whittington is a great lecturer, and if you are a quantitative concentrator, this class is a great way to break out of the hyperrational realm and engage with the liberal arts.  You meet interesting people and gain appreciation for literature while reading some epic texts.</comment>Fantastic class! Really important and interesting readings. It's definitely fast-paced, but it felt like each work was really explored in depth.</comment>I highly recommend this course. All the books on the syllabus--especially the Iliad, the Odyssey, the Aeneid, and Paradise Lost--are works every student should read in college. 

Of course, the syllabus is less important than the way the class is taught. Professor Whittington delivers an engaging, though-provoking, and insightful lecture every class. She is not only a great teacher, but an excellent human being as well. I have yet to meet another Harvard professor (especially one who teaches a class of this size) who makes such an effort to get to know her students and who cares about them on such a personal level</comment>This is one of the best classes at Harvard. The Epic explores many ideas related to both the past and modern times, and you will be constantly thinking about heroism from different viewpoints. All of the texts are awesome to read, even Middlemarch (it grows on you, I swear), and really fun to discuss. Papers can be challenging, but if you push through, you will do fine. Overall, the work load is pretty chill. Both the lecture and section are equally enjoyable. I haven't met anyone who does not like the course.</comment>This is a fantastic English class with a fantastic professor. It's also a great class coming out of high school AP-level literature courses. There's a decent amount of reading, but most of what you learn will come from listening to Professor Whittington's lectures and coming to section discussions.</comment>TAKE IT! Whittington's lectures are delightful, the readings are important and good to revisit if you've read any of them already. A course with a grand scope that really pulls it off. Just make sure you're prepared to make it through Middlemarch by the end of the semester.</comment>This English may not be for everyone. Some people are looking for courses that don't require reading books. The books are not short. 

But that aside, the course was amazing. I'm never sure of whether I will agree with previous years' Q scores because I tend to feel differently about courses than most of my classmates but I can agree that this course and Professor Whittington was incredible. Finding the course essentially made my semester.</comment>Professor Whittington is such a goddess. She is probably the best professor I have had at Harvard in my 4 years. She cares deeply about her students, is clear, concise and brilliant. I would highly recommend this class, but students should know it is very challenging and reading-intensive.</comment>This is a great, fun class. You should take it, whether you are an English concentrator, or if you just enjoy reading epic stories. Just be aware that it does require a lot of reading, so you won't be able to breeze by. But, the fast-paced reading is what allows you to get through so many classic epics, so, again, if you enjoy reading a good epic story, this course is really fun!</comment>Epic was a wonderful course. Prof Whittington is probably the best lecturer I've had. She has a detailed outline for every lecture, and follows that precisely, so that she pretty much ends precisely as the bell tolls. She also has a knack for asking questions, then taking students' answers and seamlessly weaving those into the next portion of her lecture. She always manages to deal with both lofty higher-level concepts and nitty-gritty close reading in the same lecture, integrating the two in such a way that you feel like you get a full picture of the text. It's absolutely brilliant.

Oh yeah, and the syllabus is stellar. Some of the highlights of the Western canon, selected to give you an overview of the epic tradition. 

We also had some very nice extra events, including a Milton reading one night and a Star Wars screening. Really just the icing on the cake.</comment>Professor Whittington is an excellent lecturer. She is engaging and thought-provoking, and each class had me attentive and interested. The sections aren't that useful, but it seems to be a necessary evil.</comment>I found the lectures intellectually engaging and interesting and I found the readings all very good.</comment>Lots of reading (for non-English concentrators) but totally worth it. These are books that you have to have read before graduating from college and this is the best way of doing that. Prof. Whittington is fantastic!</comment>Be prepared to read a lot. The class is absolutely worth it and the readings are really interesting.</comment>Fantastic class. Engaging lectures from Whittington are a highlight. Her passion is contagious. I took this class because I wanted to take a class with the english department, and I needed to fulfill my AI requirement. If you're looking for an easy A GenEd, this is not the course for you. The difficulty of the reading load of the course cannot be understated. If you're looking for a rich, fulfilling course that demands critical engagement with the readings, this is the course for you. Obviously, you're above to get by without doing the readings in their entirety (I'd be shocked to hear more than a handful of kids in my class did), but this can catch up with you on the midterm and final.</comment>It's a great class. Professor Whittington is a great lecturer. The readings are manageable. The papers are not long but they are graded very hard. The Midterm and Final are not hard but do require a lot of preparation.</comment>you don't actually have to do any of the reading for this class which is a good thing if you don't want to do any reading but a bad thing if you want to learn something about epics</comment></course>FRSEMR 26o: Changing Our Mind: Evolving Thoughts on Brain Regeneration</title>Paola is super nice and passionate about the material. Discussions in class were interesting, and we took a cool field trip to the Wyss Institute in Boston. The readings outside of class were difficult to understand, but I got the main points from them through class discussion. Also, I felt that we skipped over the basics and jumped right into a high level of scientific discussion. This made me feel less prepared to tackle some of the more challenging concepts. Overall, this course was interesting and not stressful. It really gets you thinking and challenges you to think creatively.</comment>This class was fantastic, super interesting without being stressful or difficult!</comment>This class was so laid back and fun. I would recommend it to anyone interested in neuroscience or regenerative biology.</comment>Good seminar for freshman year. Helps you ease into your first semester. Paola is a great professor!</comment>This isn't a structured "class" in the familiar sense. It's a seminar that is designed to be low-stress with little difficulty, and inspire students with the craziest stuff coming out of laboratories (and sci-fi) in the modern world.</comment>Take this class to spark in you a powerful imagination of what secrets are held in the last frontier and one of the most mysterious aspects of the universe: the brain.
And how to regenerate one, if possible.</comment>This was an excellent freshman seminar!  The material was very interesting, and Professor Arlotta was a great teacher.  We had a say in what we learned about and talked about current discoveries in the science field.</comment>This was the best class I took this semester. It was unlike any science class I'd taken before in that it encouraged me to think creatively about science.</comment>Paola is an amazing professor. She obviously works hard and values your opinion. This seminar is discussion based (as it should be), a low pressure environment (as it should be), and a wonderful learning experience - as only Paola could make it. 
I enjoyed every meeting and this class was exactly what i hoped college would be. I could get to talk to a world class professor and talk about what could be in the world of neuroscience.</comment></course>EXPOS 20.283: Surveillance: Legal and Ethical Issues</title>This is an awesome course! It's the perfect Expos course, with light reading. The material is interesting and highly relevant to the world we live in, and it really prepares you to think critically about the NSA's surveillance program. Dr. Sinnott is great at guiding the conversation, and remains perfectly neutral so that ideas free flowly among her students. She's also got an awesome posh Irish accent!</comment>Gillian is a wonderful instructor, and although she is new to teaching, she is an incredibly warm and sweet lady who will try her best to help you through the writing process.</comment>Take it if you're interested in the topic</comment>This course is actually an applicable and interesting class, which is a hard overlap in searching for course that also fulfill a graduation requirement.</comment>I would highly recommend this class. I found the subject both interesting and informative.  The readings are very reasonable and engaging while providing the necessary information without being too long or complex. The instructor is approachable, moderates class discussion well, and provides thoughtful feedback for each of your drafts and papers. If you have an interest in surveillance and/or government policy, you should definitely take this course. And even if not, this is still a great Expos to take.</comment>This class had the feel of both a law course and an ethics course. I did not really expect the legal part but I definitely enjoyed it.</comment>This class is definitely one of the more interesting expos classes, and allows you to learn about relevant information.</comment>most of the focus in this course is on the law side, with little room in the papers to speak on the technological parts of the topic.</comment>If you're already a good writer, this is a great and interesting way to fulfill the Expos requirement.  If you're not, it is still extremely interesting subject material, but your grade will take approximately single letter grade drop.</comment></course>NEC 97r: Group Tutorial - Sophomore Year</title>Start your papers early and go to the professor for comments on them.</comment>Professor Russell is an unforgettable character and a brilliant professor. Take this class to learn the things that other people don't bother learning. Though Prof. Russell is principally a scholar of Armenia, his knowledge of numerous other worlds (not to mention languages) is spectacular. He is also extremely accessible outside of class.</comment></course>VES 199: The Film Archive: History, Theory, Practice</title>If you're remotely interested in film, or have a vague understanding of what film can be and its vast spectrum, this class is for you. Coming in with a science background, but a love for the Hollywood blockbuster, I took this class to refine my crude understanding and perspectives towards film. Worthwhile, exciting, and intellectually stimulating conversations. You also watch some of the rarest prints, often ones people would die to see.</comment>This class was really awesome. If you are interested in seeing a wide range of film (experimental, as well as international narrative films) this course is truly for you. Haden is a great instructor and his love for the material is infectious. I really recommend this class to anyone who wants to see a lot of unique prints and think about the medium in a new way.</comment></course>FRSEMR 22l: Justice in Health: Ethics of Public Health in the Contemporary World</title>I really tried to enjoy this class, but struggled. The classes dragged on. I tried to like it, but unfortunately came to dread the class's meeting each week. I would take a class on this topic again if the format were changed and discussion was promoted more. Some complex philosophical ideas were presented in the readings. It would have been great to discuss them more in class, rather than having short definitions told to us in lectures. I felt like I was taking notes for something to do rather than because the notes were necessary.</comment>This course is a great to balance with harder courses. But don't underestimate the amount you will learn--you actually learn quite a lot.</comment>Heavy reading, but if you do it, it is worth it for the most part. Great to learn more about ethics.</comment>Overall, It's a great class if you're genuinely into justice and policy issues in health. Be prepared to read a lot.</comment>This class is good for those interested in philosophy. It focuses a lot on moral philosophy</comment></course>HIST 1700: The History of Sub-Saharan Africa to 1860</title>Fantastic teacher and materials. Professor Akyeampong really knows his tuff and is one of the most accessible professors I've had at Harvard.</comment>This class is a lot of fun. It teaches material that is very rarely taught, and does so well: starting from the very beginning, and up through the 1800s (as the name suggests). Really, you break into the Common Era after about four lectures, and 1500-1860 takes up the entire second half of the course. And, as someone who wanted to learn about Africa before colonization, I was occasionally disappointed by how much the course relied upon European written sources, and how much it covered the actions of Europeans. I think this is unavoidable, though, and in the end I thoroughly enjoyed myself.</comment>It's a survey course, so there's a lot presented and it can get pretty jumbled if you're not on top of it. Way too much reading. Only take if you love Professor Akyeampong or prehistorical/precolonial African history, otherwise it can be a pretty unsatisfying course</comment>If you want to know about this topic, this is probably the course to take. Be sure, however, that you are interested, and that you can hold your own in writing without too much feedback over the course of the semester.</comment>Professor Akyeampong is one of the nicest professors I've had and his enthusiasm for African history really comes through and makes you excited about the material as well. The weekly reading amounts assigned are often huge and impossible to do with reading loads from other classes, but if you skim the readings and get the general idea from each, you should be fine.</comment>That is a great course where your knowledge of Africa will be enhanced.</comment>it's a lot of reading, but you get the hang of figuring out what to read and what to perhaps leave for exam studying. one great thing is that there is only one reading covered each week in section, which makes it easier to keep up when other classes get busy. Prof A is a wonderful storyteller, and genuinely cares about all his students. I highly recommend taking a class with him if you have the chance!</comment>Any class with Professor Akyeampong will be one where you learn a terrific amount. His knowledge is vast and wide ranging. The lectures are great, and while the reading load isn't the lightest, you can get by doing just the section readings and selecting the lecture readings you need to fill gaps. A great course, do take it.</comment>It's great! Professor Akyeampong is an excellent lecturer. However, readings are very heavy and weekly load is high.</comment>The lecture material could be presented in a more engaging manner and the readings were at times a bit repetitive. I gained a solid understanding of the factors underlying the development of African societies across the continent, especially the impact of climate and international trade, as well as an understanding of the unique aspects of different regions. The immense geographical space and time period was made manageable by focusing on unifying themes.</comment></course>SHBT 301qc: Speech and Hearing Laboratory Visits</title>Great opportunity to get insight into labs at MEEI, HMS and MIT</comment></course>PHIL 173: Metaethics</title>This class is dope. Take it if you're at all interested in moral issues.</comment>Just take everything that Selim offers! But if you can only take one course of his, take this one.</comment>This class was really fascinating. Selim is a great lecturer and Noel is a phenomenal section leader. The topic we grappled with in class are quite difficult, and there was a tendency to get side-tracked by minute disputes in class. Section as really engaging and wonderful. The assignments were reasonable, but feedback (due to special circumstances) was hard to get. Since this was my first philosophy class, I found it really difficult to know how well I was doing the in the class. Overall, I recommend this class--it was good!</comment>If you really like philosophy, this class is great.</comment>This is the best philosophy class I've taken at Harvard. I see two huge benefits of philosophy: first, it helps you engage in many aspects of life in a meaningful, self-reflective way; second, it trains you how to think and expands your critical and creative capacities. This course did both, and did the latter to a crazy degree. I feel much more confident in my analytic and deductive capacities having taken this course, and much more confused (in a good way) about metaethics.</comment>If you're at all interested in questions concerning right and wrong, then you should at least shop this course.</comment>It's a great course, but it's very, very difficult. Do not go into it unless you are really passionate about the material.</comment>This was one of the best classes I have taken at Harvard. Selim Berker is an amazing professor, and Noel was an awesome TF. Prof Berker makes class discussion exciting, sparkling, warm and charitable in tone and at the same time incisively rigorous. I learned a lot about how to be a better philosopher from this class. The readings were not light, but manageable, and well worth it.</comment>If you are interested in learning more about ethics and learning how to argue well, then take this class. Beware though, this isn't ER18; it's a real philosophy class that requires a lot of thought and discussion with peers.</comment>This is a challenging class, and perhaps not the right fit it you're trying to just get ER out of the way, but worth every bit of effort if you're interested in almost any branch of philosophy. Metaethics is challenging because it is, essentially, the metaphysics, epistemology, and, at times, Phil of science of ethics.</comment>This is a wonderful course if you are interested in seriously engaging with and analyzing the ethical domain.  Professor Berker is a top-notch lecturer, and will address your particular questions about the material to make sure you understand and are able to participate in the conversation.  Be aware that this is by no means an easy Gen Ed:  it is rigorous 100-level philosophy, so should really only be taken if you're willing to put in the time to read and reflect on the material.</comment>This class demands a lot from you, so be prepared to work hard. With that said, this class will make you a more careful thinker and writer if you devote the right amount of time to it.</comment>This is an amazing course and a great overview to metaethics. For those who are interested in understanding what REAL philosophy is all about, this course is a great way to expose you to the rigor of philosophy without presupposing any prior knowledge (though the content is difficult).</comment>This class is very difficult, but rewarding if you put the time into it. It will make you think about moral judgments in a new way, and perhaps induce some skepticism in you!</comment>This course is overall pretty great. Selim is a great lecturer and will answer all sorts of questions in class. The topics are very interesting, but it is easy to fall behind on the readings and become confused when the paper assignments are handed out.</comment>Metaethics is a really phenomenal class that makes you think critically about your beliefs and why you believe them. Personally I hadn't thought about a lot of metaethical questions (ie what gives moral statements their force), and taking this class forced me to question why I believed them, and why I should still follow them if they don't have that same force.

But more importantly, Prof Berker is an amazing lecturer, and the number one reason you should take the class is because he's teaching it! I've never seen such a clear and organized lectures, which makes learning about the subject really fun and easy.</comment>This class is very interesting, but definitely not easy. The readings are often difficult to understand, though not impenetrable. Prof. Berker does a great job explaining the readings.</comment>This class is difficult and extremely rewarding. It encompasses so many different aspects of philosophy (metaphysics, epistemology, moral philosophy) that no matter your interests, if you have some background in philosophy you will likely find it fascinating and intellectually stimulating. I wish there were more like it at Harvard.</comment>This is the best class I've taken at Harvard so far. It's hard, but just the right amount, and it's worth it. Take it!</comment>This course is a truly excellent course for someone who has taken multiple philosophy classes already. For someone who has not yet but who has a real passion for philosophy and is invested in the content and is willing to work hard, this class is a worthwhile challenge. For someone who is not passionate about philosophy and is primarily interested in fulfilling the ER requirement, I would recommend taking something else.</comment>Overall, an interesting, well-run, and difficult course. Metaethics I think is something that a lot of people have opinions about instinctively even if they haven't heard of metaethics (I hadn't really before the course). The course exposed me to many nuances and problems that I hadn't thought about before.</comment>This class is fantastic. Metaethics is the most relevant part of philosophy, and this class will address rigorously those armchair musings about right and wrong. However, the professor's description of the class as being one of the most rigorous 100-level phil classes is probably accurate. You will need to really engage with the material -- but doing so will prove very rewarding.</comment>Selim Berker is an amazing professor- passionate, engaging, brilliant, gives great lectures and integrates class discussion really well. Metaethics is really, in many ways, THE subject to study in Philosophy, at least at some point. It is so important to understand what we are doing when we set out trying to set standards for the morally right way to live. This class looks critically at that question.</comment></course>HIST 1280: History of the Soviet Union, 1917-1991</title>This course offers a complete overview of the Soviet Union. Since this is such an involved topic, the pace can be a bit too hectic at times. The section readings are novels and memoirs, which are much more interesting than traditional historical materials.</comment>The course is alright on a day-to-day basis, but during the four day period for the take home midterm and combined workload of the final paper and exam post thanksgiving added significant stress.</comment>Prof. Martin is an enthusiastic lecturer and the course materials are great, especially if you're a history major with an interest in primary sources. Having both a final paper and an exam is always tough, but other than that the workload was also manageable and the section and lectures enjoyable.</comment>This class gives an excellent picture of Soviet history, society and culture. The lectures a fascinating and interesting, and Professor Martin is very engaging. There is a lot of reading but the grading is fair.</comment>This course is challenging but you learn a great overview of the Soviet Union.</comment>If you're interested in how Russia came to be what it is today, this class is incredible. The central "textbook" is fantastic and fun to read and the primary sources are great. Be prepared to commit A LOT of reading time to this course in order to complete a few important assignments. Professor Martin is an extremely entertaining lecturer, even if sometimes a bit scattered. This is an incredible course if you like Russian relations and history. This course changed the way I view world history.</comment>This class is a very informative course about Soviet history that will truly make you become even more understanding of Soviet history.</comment>Absolutely best course I've ever taken. The reading is doable and the TFs walk you through everything you need to know about the reading anyway. Soviet History is actually super interesting and you will enjoy the readings you do.</comment>This is a great class. Good overview of the Soviet Union, and with a professor who couldn't be more knowledgeable.</comment>Professor Martin is a wonderful and engaging lecturer able to keep the room interested for an hour and a half using only an overhead projector. The readings are very interesting, but there are very very many of them. The course truly focuses on the history of the Soviet Union with little mention of other countries, even in the context of foreign policy!</comment>If you have always been interested in the Soviet Union, its sudden and meteoric ascension, and its equally abrupt decline, this class is for you. There is relatively little focus on foreign policy, so if you're interested in the Cold War, this is probably not the best class to take. On the other hand, Professor Martin spends a great deal of time discussing Soviet leadership, and the unique modes of rule of Stalin, in particular.</comment>Students interested in the period of Russian October revolution through the Stalin period would find this course most engaging (the post-Stalin period is covered in a much more comprehensive way in the End of Communism course). Prof. Martin is an outstanding lecturer, and his enthusiasm for the subject matter is contagious. I particularly appreciated his nuanced and humanizing approach to the study of the Soviet system particularly under Stalin. Expect a decent amount of reading, though readings are very worthwhile - diverse, insightful, thought-provoking and certainly memorable.</comment></course>FRSEMR 37y: Muslim Voices in Contemporary World Literatures</title>The class is amazing, just be prepared for the work</comment>Great seminar but more demanding than others offered. Be ready to read quite a bit of material, even if it is mostly very compelling and fun to read! Also, Dr. Asani is incredibly nice and seminar discussions are usually very rewarding. Highly recommend this seminar if you are interested in learning more about Islam and its modern contexts.</comment>Professor Asani is great, I just wasn't as interested in the subject material as I thought I would be.</comment>This course is incredible. I thought I was well-aware about the world and religion, but I quickly realized that I was mistaken. Sometimes it feels like it's an information overload, but other times you are so shocked and frustrated to learn about the clash of ignorance in the world that you become inspired to do something about it. The literature is very long sometimes, and takes a long time, but the reading is SO INTERESTING and it changes your perspective about the world. I would definitely recommend reading all of the books and expressing yourself in class discussions. You learn so much from both Asani and your classmates! My favorite class!</comment>Get ready to take the best course of your life and have your mind blown! Your views on Islam will definitely change whether you are a muslim or not.</comment>Take this course--I'm not going to lie. It is a LOT of reading. You have a couple hundred of pages of reading a week. However, it is SO worth it! You will learn a lot and engage with primary contemporary literary Muslim texts! You also get to do informal blog posts (which are informal and what you want to make of it) to respond to these literary texts and you get to do ART! Assigned Art for homework? It's almost too good to be true. This is a class that will inspire you and blow your mind (there are many mind-blowing moments here) and I recommend it highly!</comment>This class was an incredibly amazing experience and wonderful part of my freshman year. Professor Asani is very understanding and has a knowledge about the subject that will blow your mind. The end-of-year creative projects are tough to complete in a short period of time, so make sure to budget your time wisely!</comment>Try and take this class - It was amazing and so eye opening!</comment>This class was the highlight of my week. It was different from other courses because I had a chance to respond creatively and freely to things that engaged me intellectually and emotionally.</comment></course>ISLAMCIV 146: al-Ghazali: Theologian and Mystic</title>Rouayheb is amazing at helping you to understand the most complex of Ghazali's thoughts. He's always open to hearing and discussing with students. Take this class! So interesting.</comment>It's a class with great exposure to an important and influential Islamic thinker -- many young Muslims look up to Ghazali today.</comment></course>ENG-SCI 181: Engineering Thermodynamics</title>Chances are you have to take this class - it's not easy but it is well structured which helps tremendously.</comment>Its a decent engineering course. Not as exciting as some courses, but the material is interesting enough. It is more targeted towards mechanical engineering, which was a little frustrating at times for a biomedical engineer, but i still felt like i learned a lot</comment>Only and I repeat only take it if you absolutely have to. Probably one of the hardest classes at Harvard. In many situations even the tf's did not know what was going on and struggled to help the students.</comment>Find yourself a good study buddy. You're going to need them.</comment>If you are a physics student, this class is a much easier alternative to Physics 181. You will still learn all of the material necessary for the GRE and, unless statistical mechanics is necessary for the field you're going into, you'll probably leave with more applicable knowledge from this course. Aziz is a much clearer lecturer than most physics professors.</comment>go to sections and office hours - they are immensely helpful if the TFs are nearly as helpful as they were this year. course is frustrating and time consuming, but i defintiely gained a knowledge of thermodynamics.  wish material on HE 2 was covered longer and perhaps less topics were covered.</comment>It will be hard and time consuming but worth it.</comment>Go to office hours. And section even though it's optional.</comment>Really interesting but difficult material.</comment>Much like what people have said for eons about this class, it's a great class and you learn a lot but it will take a huge amount of time. The course is extremely well organized, in my opinion. Do capitalize on Aziz's availability (OHs and class time), he understands the material really well and he is more than happy to explain things if you only ask.</comment>You will learn a huge amount, but it takes a lot of time--be prepared to work hard and go to office hours when you can.</comment>Great engineering class. Material is fun and problem sets contain realistic industrial problems about energy generation, engine operations, and electrochemistry. Great teaching staff. Concepts and calculations are always related back to industrial applications. Lectures are engaging and interesting; sections and office hours helpful in completing problem sets. Labs are interesting.</comment>You have to take the course, so set your jaw and deal with it. I would be shocked if you enjoyed it, but at least you bond with other engineers over your shared misery.</comment>This course is a requirement for engineering, but the material is actually quite useful.  While it does require a significant amount of outside work (between psets, readings, studying for reading quizzes,labs, lab write-ups, etc.), if you put in the effort, it really isn't that bad.  Definitely make use of sections and office hours!</comment>ES181 is vital to a good engineering background. Challenging but rewarding course.</comment>if you don't have to take it, please don't. Possibly my hardest class yet but I can't forsee how much easier it could possibly be</comment>Usually the only people taking the class are people who need it for requirements.  I definitely learned a lot in this class and it wasn't nearly as bad as what I heard.  Psets would take an average of like 8 hours which really wasn't bad.  Some people would start it at office hours the day or day before it was due.</comment>This class is hard and time consuming but not as bad as I'd been led to believe going in. Start the problem sets early , GO TO OFFICE HOURS, do lots of practice problems in preparation for exams, and you'll get through it in one piece.</comment>The concepts are not really that hard, but putting them to use is often difficult and unwieldly.  The class is not very interesting but is well taught.  As far as workload, the entirety of my thursday afternoon/night each week was sacrificed, but other than that it wasn't too bad.  It's a fairly tough course, but nothing you can't handle.</comment>Get ready to devote ridiculous hours to this class. Just to keep up, you have to spend about 12 hours for each pset and 3 hours for the weekly reading. The good news is that the class is taught well, and there are countless resources to help you.</comment>This was actually one of my favorite classes. The material is hard, but it is taught incredibly well. There are a lot of resources to help you understand the material. If you're up for working hard, this will be a very rewarding class</comment>This class will be the most challenging class you take at Harvard, but the supportive staff and professor make it all worth it. You can and will be able to master the material, and you will feel amazing when you do. This is the type of class which is so challenging students in the class form a type of bond that makes it feel close and fun.</comment>You have to take it.</comment>Be thankful that Aziz is not teaching the course next year.
Enough said.</comment>Incredibly difficult material presented just about as well as it can be.</comment>You're probably only looking into this course because it's a requirement, so you'll most likely take it regardless of what I say. Anyway, the class isn't as awful as it sounds, but it's still a pretty big pain! Just be sure to actually engage yourself with the reading, as that's where you'll learn most of what you know in the course. It's easy to just skim through and not actually absorb anything, but don't do that! Also, try to start your psets early and study for midterms using the practice problems provided. If you do all of those things, you should be pretty set in the course, and should be able to learn a decent amount!</comment>You better strap yourself down to whatever chair you're sitting on, because this is going to be a rough f**king ride.</comment></course>AESTH&INTP 20: Poems, Poets, Poetry</title>amazing TFs lecture is a little dull sometimes</comment>You'll be exposed to an exhaustive list of poets and poems; the course is so broad that you're bound to like something that you read. The week-to-week work is very manageable, and the three essays, midterm and final seem fair. That being said, lectures got extremely boring. While it's clear that Professor Vendler is a master of poetry, she rarely gave us the tools to analyze poetry on a higher level; it was all about her explaining a couple poems a class (but rarely did she tell us how she got to the analyzations she presented). I found I didn't learn much at all in lecture.</comment>Given that I've had trouble fulfilling the A&I requirement over the past four years because I didn't find any of the courses appealing, this was a pretty painless way to do it. I chose it because I remembered at least not hating poetry in high school, and my choice was rewarded ten times over. Even if you're not over the moon about poetry, there is no denying that both the course and teaching staff are exceptional. Helen Vendler clearly cares about teaching, and is an amazing lecturer. Likewise, the section component was very welcoming and seemed to be geared toward making sure that students were actually enjoying and getting something out of the course. In terms of workload, it was one of the lightest ones I've ever had, mostly because the poems we read were relatively short, so the weekly readings were at most a few pages long (and that was for the longest poems we read. Most were around a quarter of a page, and we only had to read a few per week). And though I did feel kind of bad about doing it, I found very easy to go through the course without ever once memorizing a poem in its entirety (well, at least on purpose. They tend to stick when you reread them so much while writing an essay). All in all, it was a great course and a great way to fulfill the gen ed requirement. I highly recommend it.</comment>- Light workload. - Was not necessary to memorize poems weekly. More informal. - Come up with a good thesis and defend it: key to papers. - Wasn't much need to read the book. Pretty much all the work is in the papers.</comment>Lovely course with a great professor. Professor Vendler's expertise in the field of poetry is amazing. The textbook is also written by her and has a great selection of varied texts to read. The lectures are engaging but one note is that we never had discussions in lecture, and also Vendler has quite a gentle voice so it was sometimes hard to stay awake. The courseload was very very minimal, which was the best thing about this course, especially if other courses you are taking are difficult. Weeks would go by where I would do basically no work for the class outside of lecture. The three papers we wrote throughout the course, however, do take up time and I recommend beginning on them much in advance of the deadline. This is definitely a good, low-key class.</comment>Prof. Vendler is an incredible lecturer and will definitely make you see the beauty in poetry. In many ways she teaches you how to analyze poetry as if it were a painting. In this way you begin to see, hear, and feel poetry in a new way, and in a way that allows you to listen to your own soul and thoughts.</comment>This is a nice class where you get to go hear Vendler talk about poetry for an hour. It is pretty illuminating to hear her talk about poems.</comment>This class was definitely more difficult than I expected. With section assignments, three papers, a midterm, and a final, it had definitely a heavier workload than I expected. The organization could be better, but Vendler was a great lecturer and is truly able bring the poems to life. The section component seemed pretty pointless to me, however.</comment>take it if you like poetry and want to read a selection of some of the all-time greats</comment>If you want to read more poetry, this is the course for you. Professor Vendler teaches a technical and concrete approach that makes the seemingly abstract art of poetry accessible for anyone.</comment>How much you get out of this class depends on how much you are willing to engage with the text prior to lecture. Preferably you have a genuine interest in poetry and aren't just looking for an easy gen ed, because it is really easy to waste this class daydreaming and doodling if you are not interested in the material.</comment>While Professor Vendler's readings of specific poems - and of the poetic medium at large - are insightful, well-constructed, and a joy to behold. That said, this course lacks a clear structure or narrative throughout, and lectures quickly get rather repetitive. Only take AI20 if you care enough about the former aspect of the course that the latter doesn't faze you.</comment>If you like poetry, and are willing to attend the majority of the lectures, take this! Prof. Vendler is amazing and the ways she analyzes poetry is incredible.</comment>Take this course, especially if you know nothing about poetry. Vendler is amazing and so knowledgeable, and the workload is extremely manageable.</comment>It's a good class: Helen Vendler is a brilliant poetry critic and her textbook is exceptional. But we spend a long time on rather archaic poetry, which can feel less relevant to the modern reader.</comment>Great poem selection, Helen Vendler is a great resource.</comment>The class is very interesting, especially if you have little background in poetry.</comment>Excellent opportunity to read poetry and study under one of the best.  You will see language as an art as never before. Remember in high school when you were told everything in the poem was a symbol and you just said BS maybe it's just a candle and a dove. When Helen Vendler explain it you believe her. She makes poetry come to life and make sense, it's incredible. It is the quintessential Harvard course where a brilliant professor simply stands up and talks, no powerpoints no over-planned lectures no fuss, just Helen Vendler talking interpretive brilliance. An opportunity not to be passed up.</comment>Helen Vendler is a fantastic lecturer, and her classes are both enjoyable and fascinating. The assignments are also interesting and fairly easy to complete. The course requires very little work, overall, but you get out what you put in - the more you engage, the better you will become at reading poetry and the more pleasure you will be able to take in doing so.</comment>It's an awesome class if you like reading/poetry. Prof Vendler's lectures are great, and because most people aren't English concentrators, it's unlikely to be too difficult either.</comment>The textbook for this course is phenomenal; if you want to learn how to write and analyze poetry effectively, read the book. The course itself, however, is not very insightful. The lectures are interesting to listen to if you want to hear about Vendler's analysis of some poems, but this does make a course. There is no engagement here. The sections are quite lax, but this is not necessarily a positive; a much more involved, insightful discussion would make the class more meaningful. This is partly due to the class being not as organized as it could be. The most difficult part is pleasing your TF with your writing, because the TF's are all over the spectrum of difficulty; how well you do in the course will depend on your TF.</comment>This course is a fantastic entry point into the world of poetry for those that are interested in poetry, might have a few poems that have struck them in the past, but do not feel well-read or qualified to approach a fully new poem on their own.</comment>This class is ok. The lectures are pretty good, but the essays are annoying. There's not too much work other than the essays and you'll be fine on the exams if you can regurgitate what Prof. Vendler said in lecutre.</comment>This class is one of those "get out of it what you put into it" courses. It was refreshing to take a class that made me think in a different way. The poems are wonderful. Essays are a bit rough and dry but nothing you can't handle.</comment>If I could, I would walk around quoting Helen Vendler all day and sounding eloquent.</comment>Professor Vendler's lecture are a joy. Section could feel dull in comparison, though.</comment>The lecture component of the class is really "Helen Vendler's favorite poems and how she reads them." While this is not wholly unreasonable---Professor Vendler is a great authority on poetry---it can be very difficult for students to extract the general methods of analyzing and appreciating poems outside of the ones with which we are presented, and methods we can use without being Helen Vendler. The section component of the class does venture into the area of metaphors with uncertain factual basis, but fortunately, the focus is not there, and section does not rely on them---a huge plus!

Altogether this class increased my appreciation for poetry by a nonzero amount (though perhaps less than wished for or expected), and has an acceptable workload (made lighter with familiarity with writing literary analyses). As an introductory survey to poetry/gen ed, it is a reasonable candidate.</comment>This course will surely open your mind to how expressive and essential poetry is able to be. I was already interested in poetry in English and other languages; however, this class is inspiring and refreshing, usually not falling into any stale groove.</comment>Vendler is great, but some of what she says in lecture is obvious (she'll give a summary of the poem sometimes. I wish she had done deep analysis every time). Thoroughly shop this class before deciding to take it.</comment>The material is great and the papers are fun to write. The lectures by Helen Vendler are insightful, but are sometimes a bit disorganized. A lot of whether you will enjoy this course comes down to who your section TF is.</comment>It doesn't get any better than biweekly poetry readings with Helen Vendler. You will learn to appreciate poems as works of art (providing aesthetic pleasure) and science (requiring evidence-based reasoning). You will learn about how great poets think and how you think. And you will carry these lessons with you throughout your time at Harvard and (I imagine) beyond.</comment>This is a really great class to learn about poetry, particularly if you're like me and you haven't really had any exposure to it. Even if you think you hate poetry, Helen Vendler is a national treasure and being able to listen to her for an hour twice a week is fascinating (and very soothing, so you might want to have some coffee beforehand). That said, it's definitely not an easy A if you're not used to writing about poetry, and so I wouldn't take it if your only goal is satisfying the AI gen-ed and you really don't want to learn anything about poetry.</comment>Helen Vendler is a great lecturer, and if enjoy writing and poetry, you would like this course. However, unless you have a genuine love poetry, it can difficult to be very engaged in the material.</comment>Helen Vendler is of course an institution.  She is a great introduction to poetry, and covers a range of styles and movements.  That said, she is not particularly dynamic, and the assignments are rather unclear.</comment>It looks easy, and it is easy, but you should swallow your pride and take it, because Professor Vendler is truly wonderful. She is absolutely one of the best lecturers on poetry in the world. And just because you don't need to put in a million hours into reading every week doesn't mean that you won't get a lot out of the course. These poems, if you let them, really can challenge you in their own right.</comment>Getting to take a class with Helen Vendler is an awesome opportunity. She's incredibly wise and has a wonderful capacity for reading poetry. She's also kind and understanding, and meeting with her one-on-one (to talk about poetry or anything else) is very rewarding. While it can be frustrating to not be able to add input in lecture, I found listening to Prof. Vendler for an hour stimulating and enjoyable.</comment>Take this class if you're interested (even remotely) in poetry. It will make poetry much less intimidating and much more accessible. Vendler is an incredible professor and her lectures are just awe-inspiring. Sections are quite good and consist of some interesting conversations.</comment>Read poems before class to keep your mind fresh</comment>A passion for poetry really helps. This isn't an easy "I'll just take this course and get an A" type of class. It's really quite rigorous at points, despite having a not so bad workload.</comment>TAKE THIS CLASS. You will be introduced to such a wealth of lyric poetry by poets spanning several centuries and you will learn to appreciate the depth of meaning and beauty in these poems. Professor Vendler's lectures are incredible and her insights into criticism fascinating. Go to office hours-- you will be treated to lengthy, meaningful conversation with one of America's most important poetry critics and also one of the nicest people I have had the chance to meet at Harvard.</comment>This is an amazing class if you are at all interested in learning about how to read poetry. We go through many different types of poems that cover a variety of subjects from 1600-present. Prof Vendler is an amazing professor and section is awesome. If you are intrigued, take it!</comment>This is a good class. Sample 5 centuries of English-language poetry, hear one of the world's leading critics talk about cool stuff. If you like poetry, there's a lot to get out of this class. If you don't, be prepared for some pretty dry lectures.</comment>The material you will study (the poems Vendler has selected) are AMAZING, but that's about the best thing I took away from this class.</comment>I recommend that anyone interested in sampling a poetry course should take this class.  My only reservation is that students should understand that they will have to put forth effort in the course and should not get caught up in the passive experience that they may enjoy in preliminary lectures.</comment>You really learn a lot and only have to do work that'll be important for your appreciation of poetry--nothing extraneous. It is overall a very thoughtful syllabus and Maria was very thoughtful in the way she conducted section.</comment>Take it for Helen Vendler and because you will understand every poem on the syllabus after the class is over (if you pay attention in class, attend office hours, and work hard on your essays). Some lectures were very deep and made me cry.</comment>If you like poetry or would like to explore poetry, this class is for you! The work load is very light (readings are much shorter than for other gen eds), and if you like reading poetry, it doesn't even seem like work! Come to lectures and sections prepared, and you get so much out of this class!</comment>You absolutely need to take this class. This is coming from a SEAS kid who thought this would just be an easy A. I probably learned more in this class than most other introductory courses at Harvard.</comment>It's a good course but does not enable independent thinking to the degree I would expect of a humanities class.</comment>Great course for a good introduction to poetry. Great textbook and lectures by Prof. Vendler. However, what the exams and papers tested didn't quite match the material in lecture and most learning took place in the first few weeks or in section.</comment>I was really looking forward to this class, but was overall disappointed. Professor Vendler is an incredible lecturer, which is the saving grace. You will learn a lot from lecture. However, there is no sense of community among the class (including within section), and never any room for students to interpret poems for themselves, which was incredibly frustrating. It makes for a decent survey course, but you must conform to the perspective of the professor/TF's.</comment>This course is a treat because you get to listen to Helen Vendler twice a week: her lectures are mesmerizing and exciting. Get to read a variety of lyric poetry, old and new. Not too work-intensive: there are three papers, but one is ungraded, and the midterm and final are fairly straightforward if you have digested at least some of the poetic analysis tools offered throughout the course.</comment>The course is good. It does not cater particularly well to the beginner and you can not be tired in lecture or the voice of the venerable Vendler will put you to sleep.</comment>Helen Vendler is a genius. As a senior, I consider this course to be among those that I feel most grateful for having been able to partake in during my time at Harvard.</comment>This is one of the few classes that truly taught something new about the world. Vendler is so eloquent with her analysis of individual poems that you can't help but see the layer underneath the surface of each poem. This class showed me a different way of looking at literature.</comment>The lectures are great, but the section discussion isn't; people aren't very articulate or prepared.</comment>very easy</comment>If you are looking for an extremely easy Gen Ed, this is it. I skated by without doing any of the reading and not always going to lecture. That being said, I do think I took away a greater appreciation for poetry, just by virtue of the fact that Helen Vendler's enthusiasm for the subject is contagious. However, her lectures tend to be rambling and she is at times out of touch with the fact that she is talking to a lecture hall full of students who also have ideas and might like to participate in the discussion of the poems she is talking about. Easy class, but frustrating sometimes.</comment></course>EXPOS 20.275: Democracy in the Digital Age</title>Yascha is awesome, and the topic is very interesting. He is also very accommodating, and for me, it never seemed like Expos deadlines interfered with deadlines for other classes. Some of the people I've talked to in other Expos classes have complained about when their assignments were due.</comment>Unlike some expos courses, Yascha manages to make Democracy in the Digital Age an overall pretty engaging course. Although the first 2 or 3 weeks are medium levels of interesting (depending on how fascinating you find reading the Constitution, and the Federalist Papers), from then on pretty much all of the readings/documentaries are actually a worthwhile read. It helps that Yascha is a passionate, humorous, and pretty chill guy in class, so class discussions with him are actually productive and interesting. Made my experience in expos much more positive than I expected.</comment>This course is really helpful for writing gov-related essays in the future. The readings are slightly heavy but hugely rewarding. Yascha is a fantastic instructor.</comment>Great combination of writing and studying the democracy of the US.</comment>While I initially did not like the course, I now realize its value every time I work on an academic paper. The topic is interesting and relevant, and many of the readings after the first unit are contemporary.</comment>Great introduction to writing at the college level. Readings, gradings, and feedback were all reasonable and helped encourage stronger writing. Yascha was a great preceptor and did a good job preparing for and furthering class discussion. My favorite class this semester.</comment>Great teacher, leads classrooms discussions well, offers informative feedback</comment>This is a fantastic course if you're interested in CS, government, or both (like I was). Yascha is a great preceptor, the essays are really tough but really formative, and you become a much stronger thinker and writer - and, honestly, a much smarter person.

Beyond just the writing itself - which was a strong opportunity for growth - the subject matter was fantastic, which is much more than I can say for other Expos classes. It's great learning about the intersection of two very important and very interesting fields.

There's plenty of freedom to explore whatever you want, especially on Essay 3. For all the essays, you can really choose whatever position you want and Yascha will buy it. There's no right answer. There's plenty of opportunity for independent exploration, and you can learn tons about how democracy and government work and how technology can play into that. It's more a government class than a CS class - it's a government class with a technical angle, which I found really fascinating.

This was easily my most difficult course of the semester, but it was worth it. TAKE IT if you like either of the subjects! 100%.</comment>I really enjoyed this class. The first unit was a bit boring because a lot of it was the Founding Fathers' political theories, but the second and third units were fascinating -- I learned so much about government and technology that I hadn't even considered before. In terms of the writing aspect of the course, it will help if you have a strong background already in writing clear, well-structured, well-argued papers but this course does provide a lot of leeway for those who improve throughout the course (the final paper counts a lot more than the first ones). By the end of the course you will become a better academic argument writer. Yascha is a great discussion leader and provides excellent, detailed feedback on your papers. Take this course if you are interested in government/democracy, it is quite enjoyable if you allow yourself to be absorbed by the material.</comment>It's an interesting course where you learn a fair amount about both the topic and how to improve your writing.</comment>If you are interested in the theory of democracy and technological innovations in government, take this class. However, the readings and essay questions are pretty specific about the topic. Yascha gives great feedback on essays and your writing really does get better over the course.</comment>It's an okay expos course, and it's ultimately helpful in bettering your writing, but I don't know how much it's better than another expos course. The professor is good, but a little strange, and gives some very helpful advice on writing. I thought it would be more of a media and journalism class, but it's literally about democracy proposals that utilize e-voting and stuff. Just be aware that it's all about systems of government and takes a while to get to the "digital age" part.</comment>Absolutely recommend this course. It greatly improved my writing and the preceptor is extremely helpful.</comment></course>HISTSCI 99a: Tutorial - Senior Year</title>Writing a thesis is like maintaining a romantic relationship: you love it to death but it can sometimes be filled with drama and stress. Your thesis advisor is like the relationship counselor.</comment>Be prepared to make writing a senior thesis your top academic priority!</comment>HistSci 99 provides a good amount of structure to the thesis-writing process, but does not overburden students with unnecessary deliverables or busy work.</comment>Hard but rewarding.</comment>If you have a great thesis topic that you know you'll love digging into, definitely write one! The History of Science department is very flexible with helping you write a thesis on something you're really interested in, so it's a great opportunity to take if you know you'd enjoy writing a long paper.</comment>The senior thesis process is the most challenging and stressful experience at times and the most rewarding and exciting at others. Remember that this is a race and you won't always be sprinting, but that's okay. Take your time, pace yourself, be patient with your ideas, and constantly write (even if painfully difficult to get words to page).</comment>i recommend if you want to write a thesis. If you are really busy outside of this class, it easily falls to the backburner because there aren't many deadlines. be careful of letting that happen.</comment>Great opportunity to do in-depth research on a topic of your choosing. Start early and sustain your work throughout the semester so that you don't scramble to produce your first chapter at the end.</comment></course>E-PSCI 21: The Dynamic Earth: Geology and Tectonics Through Time</title>The content is awesome! Overall, it's not stressful and the people are nice. You go on field trips. It's poorly organized. If you don't like rocks, don't take it.</comment>This is an okay class. Be prepared to memorize. The field trips are fun, as are the labs when they are hands-on (though they are three hours long and are sometimes busy work). Prof O'Connel is funny, though lectures can be dry and sometimes seem irrelevant. That being said, it is interesting to understand the macro-scale workings of the planet. Knowing a lot about rocks is valuable for hikers and climbers, and I suppose also if you just like rocks. Sarah is a great and really helpful TF.</comment>First of all, this is an introductory course for the EPS department, not a totally fuzzy gen ed. There is a lot to learn for anyone that has had zero exposure to tectonic phenomena, rock types, mineral types, etc. All that said, if you have interest in geology, the planet, I thought this course was really worthwhile.   The biggest problem I really found was organization and clarity of instructions. The labs are well designed and prepared, but sometimes it just isnt clear what is wanted. Also, sometimes it is assumed that you will just know everything that was taught in the last three lectures by the time lab comes around, but each lecture can have upwards of 20-30 new terms and concepts, so that could be unrealistic. Anyhow, the most challenging part was the field trips. TF-s will take you through most fo the material in person, but good luck trying to figure out what it wanted on your own.</comment>Lecture is terribly boring, but you don't have to go since none of it shows up on the tests.</comment>I think the Q scores for this class are misleading. It really isn't a terrible class at all; I actually enjoyed it on the whole. Professor O'Connell is a really nice guy who I would describe as a charming pedagogue. He has a lot of information to offer to the students. Also, there are no problem sets for this class, just weekly labs which you often complete in assigned lab hours anyways, so the workload for this class is very light. The material isn't hard to grasp if you do your due diligence, especially since the TFs are really helpful and do their best to make sure this class is run smoothly. Plus, the field trips are pretty fun and the second one allows you to get off campus for a weekend and spend some time outdoors. Overall, I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to know more about the world around them.</comment>This class was a good introduction to geology, although it could sometimes be a bit dry/boring. Rick knows a ton and is incredibly intelligent, but it was sometimes difficult to pay attention during lectures, especially first thing in the morning. The class is interesting if you are interested in the course material. For those who weren't, it was a bit rough. Field trips were awesome, and I'd say the majority of the learning during the course happened in the field with Francis. Overall I'd recommend it but only if you're genuinely interested in geology and the solid earth.</comment>Students that have never had any exposure to geology or earth and planetary sciences should definitely take this class to expose themselves to this field; they might even end up switching to the concentration, which absolutely spoils its students.</comment>Required for EPS concentrators. Dependent on the staff</comment>This is a class with a lot of potential, but it's disorganized to the point of being at times fairly distracting/frustrating. Prof O'Connell and the TFs are very nice though not really on the same page. Definitely consider this class if you think you're interested in earth science, but be ready to do a lot of learning (and memorizing) on your own. This ends up not being a hard class; the problem is that it's kinda stressful in that you never quite know how lectures and the textbook and labs and such are going to connect (or not). Field trips are really beautiful (to Boston Bay and the Berkshires/Appalachians) and make some of the tedium/very conceptual stuff worth it and actually fairly fascinating.</comment>The class is disorganized but does manage to provide an overview of a variety of topics in geology. The lectures ranged from boring to interesting but the information you need for exams is mostly found in labs, not in lectures. I would recommend this class as a good introduction to earth sciences even though I have some issues with the overall structure of the course.</comment>The course needs to be re-vamped and a better structure put in place but the information you learn is really interesting</comment>This class is good if you are interested in the material. If you are interested you can look past all of the administrative issues there are.</comment>This is an interesting class if this is the discipline you are absolutely interested in.</comment>Unless required through EPS, I wouldn't take this easy yet frustratingly disorganized SPU course until lectures are improved. If required, don't be scared, rocks are cool and the people are great!</comment></course>NEUROBIO 98r: Laboratory Research</title>A great way to make enough time for research!</comment>Research (with intent to write a thesis or without) is the cornerstone of academic endeavors and this is the ultimate method of creating new information. This is your opportunity to engage in the creation of knowledge that you benefit from everyday, whether in an academic or layman society.</comment>You must be able to pace yourself and work independently.</comment>Doing research is a very rewarding experience that really teaches you how to think critically and scientifically.</comment>Great way to balance research with academics!</comment>Great way to get credit for research and have some flexibility in your schedule, especially in working on a thesis.</comment>This is a great way to ease your workload a bit if you'd like to spend a little more time working on research. If you're doing a thesis, it's basically required as you'll be spending a fair amount of time on it. If you've never done research before, maybe try working with the lab on a volunteer basis first so that it's a bit easier to switch if the lab doesn't work for you.</comment>98r is an incredible opportunity for thesis writing seniors! Once you find a good lab, you're all set.</comment>Great class to take if you're working on a thesis</comment>The professor and tfs for this course all had good intentions and definitely wanted to make sure you learn a lot; that being said, the course lectures were a little too fast to pick up on every detail and the course sections were highly disorganized.</comment>Since it's a research for credit, your experience depends on what lab you work in, but if you have a research project you're really interested in, and want to spend a substantial amount of time on it each week, this is a great option.</comment>Do it!</comment></course>FOLKMYTH 98a: History and Theory of Folklore and Mythology</title>This course is an excellent survey of folklore scholarship starting since the establishment of the field, all of which is useful and necessary for doing work in the department.</comment>This course is a great survey of folklore thought. The readings are very engaging, so be sure to do all of them when you can! The book reviews are thought provoking and the oral exam is an interesting experience.</comment>This class is a lot of information to take in, but it's necessary to get a grounding in the field and Steve also presents it in the most user-friendly way possible. I mostly rated this "difficult" not necessarily because the readings themselves are extremely difficult, but just because there are a lot of them.</comment>This is a great course in the sequence of Folk and Myth concentration requirements. Look forward to it!</comment></course>HIST 99: Senior Thesis Tutorial</title>YOU ARE SO LUCKY THAT YOU ARE A HISTORY CONCENTRATOR! The History dept. may not bug you junior fall to choose a topic and advisor before Christmas, but they will help you do both of those things the summer before you are back on campus and then guide you through a painless and relatively stress-free thesis-writing process. I am filling out the Q guide after having spent my second day of break working on my second chapter and I'm in a >great mood<. History 99 prepares you well.</comment>History 99 provides just the right amount of structure for writing a good thesis. Carla and Heidi will keep you on track and provide lots of ideas for every aspect of the project.</comment>You have to take it if you're writing a thesis, so the issue is really whether or not you want to do that.</comment>To be fair, Hist 99 per se is not a lot of work. And it's not particularly exciting either. It's just a requirement that you have to fulfill. That being said, it is still a very good way to keep up with your thesis work and deadlines and get some extra feedback. Carla and Heidi are both very helpful in the that regard.</comment>This class really helps ease the thesis process. The material is helpful, it is organized well. However it will not save you if you're writing on something you're not excited about, so the real question is, are you planning on writing a thesis? If the answer is yes, then you have to take this class. If the answer is maybe, I would think a little harder before enrolling.</comment>From what I understand less busy work than last year, which is an improvement, but I still think we could meet less frequently.</comment>This tutorial is a wonderful supplement to the thesis process. It helps you stay on track and stay calm by dividing the huge thesis project into more manageable chunks. It also gives you people in the history department who can offer advice and guidance during the process.</comment>The History Department has step up a course that keeps its concentrators on top of deadlines and on track with their writing. It can seem that these deadlines are too early while in the course, but, in the long run, it will make thesising not as painful as it could be.</comment></course>NEUROBIO 306qc: Quantitative Methods for Biologists</title>Don't be afraid to take this class if you haven't had any Matlab experience. This course was specifically designed for people with no Matlab experience. However, the class became exponentially harder. I feel like we went from useful basics to super specific stuff that I wouldn't even use really quickly.</comment>The course is very useful for people wanting to get into more quantitative biology work. Plus, MATLAB is great.</comment>I liked this course but I have since forgotten everything I learned because I am no longer using MATLAB for anything. Maybe if they had given us practice questions afterwards or a document that summarizes all the codes we had learned then I would have remembered everything later.</comment>If you're interested in doing computational work, especially in neuroscience, and need to know more about programming, take this. If not, it may not be what you're looking for, but if you're taking it before G1 it is a good way to meet your classmates working on problems together.</comment>It's a good bonding experience so that you can meet your fellow students before orientation and classes pick up, but I would only take it for the social benefits, not for any academic ones.</comment>It's a very immersive experience, and some of the more involved assignments overwhelmed me, but the TA's and the review sessions were a big help and should be taken advantage of.</comment>You need to have at least some coding experience, or else you will be lost. There is also very little focus on biologically relevant data (except for the last lecture).</comment>A course that teaches how to use Matlab and its applications to research. You don't need computational background to take the course. Very helpful and effective course.</comment>I felt like I definitely learned a lot and it was a great introduction to programming in matlab, especially when partnered with solving biological problems.</comment></course>AFRAMER 90r.a1: Afrikaans</title>All this course needs is a bit more organization. That said, Lynn is a terrific teacher and Afrikaans is a fun and laid back way to learn a language.</comment>This course is a wonderful way to continue your Afrikaans education. Lynn is a phenomenal teacher. She works to make the class fun for students and makes it easy to learn.</comment></course>ENGLISH 199a: Rules of the Game: The History of Literary Theory</title>This course is a fantastic introduction to literary criticism and theory. Menand is an extremely intelligent, engaging, and confident lecturer, who never fails to make the always rich and often difficult material seem accessible. He is quite accessible as well, and always open to answering questions. Just about every reading was engaging; the required Norton anthology contains many of the course readings but it also provides information on anything else pertaining to literary theory about which you might be curious. NB regarding the papers: they can be difficult because they require you to do your own theorizing, to think very self-consciously about what YOU think literature is/does. Certainly the readings will be important to your arguments, but to compose the paper you do not employ "close reading" or answer historical questions like you're probably used to doing in other humanities courses.</comment>This course is a fantastic introduction to literary theory. All English concentrators should take this class! I feel like I learned a lot of things that were necessary for me to know, and that I would not have learned in any other course. Menand is a fantastic lecturer, and the readings are, by and large, very interesting.</comment>This is an incredibly difficult, fast-paced course. Those with a huge interest in theory will love it but pretty much everyone else will have a very difficult time.</comment>Professor Menand is an excellent lecturer. The syllabus is full of brilliant minds. Definitely take this course as an introduction into literary theory if you think that might interest you. However, the course does feel a bit choppy since the readings not all necessarily connect, but that's something I think can be overlooked.</comment>Menand is an excellent lecturer, which makes class enjoyable. He tends to favor a historical analysis of the authors over an in-depth analysis of their texts, but this helps tie the class together and put everything in context, which is cool. The papers are not too bad, and actually pretty interesting. If you are interested in actually thinking about the role of literature in the world and what literature should be, you will enjoy doing the work and get a lot out of this class.</comment>The class is quite abstract so it helps to be comfortable and interested in it, or you might float off into space. Definitely keep up with readings, even it some are dense, and ask the instructors and your peers to challenge and validate your thought. You should be comfortable enough with major theories to play with them, connect them, argue for/against them as you develop your own. 
Come with these:
-An interest in these questions: why does literature matter? What is literature? How do people think? How does literature link the individual and society?
-Some prior exposure to a broad range of literature--it will help you understand the abstract by grounding it in concrete examples. It will also come in handy for essays. 
-Creativity and perhaps the insolence to question big thinkers.</comment>It's an exceptional class.</comment>Professor Menand is a wonderful lecture; I appreciated his ability to synthesize complex readings and his ability to weave in interesting information about an author or era, which made the lectures very engaging. Each class's reading consists of a more foundational text paired with a more modern text; I really enjoyed the paired readings but keep in mind that it is literary criticism and the texts are densely packed with ideas (and you have to a lot some more time for understanding the older texts). There are two paper assignments (5-7 page and 10-12 page) which are meant to show your own ideas (and rely less on the readings) while the midterm and final are tests of the lecture material. As a result, it's really important that you attend lecture to know what concepts to focus on (and it really clarifies any confusion about the reading). There were many opportunities to meet with the TF (Dena) and Prof. Menand outside of class, you just have to take the initiative to schedule them.</comment>A phenomenal class. Professor Menand is one of the best lecturers I've ever had. He never presents you with his point of view. Instead, he distills major theories into contextualizing lectures that make each argument so compelling that you agree with them all completely--until you realize that they all disagree with one another. Forces you to think for yourself. I've written plenty of research papers in other English classes, but this was the first class to really make me think of myself as joining a conversation of past thinkers and standing on someone else's shoulders.</comment>The course is designed extremely well to teach a basic framework of theory and criticism.</comment>This course is a good overview of the field of literary theory and criticism.  Menand is a terrific lecturer.  The readings are essential to studying literature, so you may as well do them with the help of the TF and Professor Menand.  The exams are easy if you attend lecture, and the papers are interesting to write.</comment>Hopefully you're taking it because you like English, because it's a little obtuse material-wise for anyone who doesn't like English.

But if you do like English, it's absolutely fantastic. Menand does a really good job of just laying out the material and then teaching it to you. Meanwhile, the sections are a good outlet for discussion, and the essays are an outlet for your own ideas. I think it really is the perfect English class. It's genre specific, so if you don't like learning criticism then you might get bored, but I think the genre is so fundamental to English that this is just the kind of English class you can't miss out on.</comment>If you're interested in lit theory, this is a great overview! Prof. Menand is an extraordinary lecturer with a gift for distilling complex concepts from dense readings.</comment>Menand is an amazing professor. This is a class you should take, if you're at all interested in an interesting, common-sense introduction to literary theory.</comment>I can only imagine this class being good if you have genuine interest in literature and literary/intellectual history. But as someone who does have those interests, I had a great time and felt that I gained a deeper understanding of history and of the field of Literary Studies in general. Professor Menand is a fantastic lecturer-he really makes the texts and writers come to life. Lectures were both interesting and entertaining, and I often left the class feeling that I had gained real and valuable insight into literary history. Section was just okay-the TF was somewhat disorganized and struggled to focus conversation in a specific direction, so I never felt that I really gained a lot from section meetings. That said, Dena was very enthusiastic and incredibly thoughtful and helpful during office hours. If you're taking this class as an elective, it should be because you want to familiarize yourself more with the Western canon and the thought that went on behind the books you read in your English classes.</comment>The reading list in this course is great, but there are many authors and we didn't get to look too deeply at any of them. Prof. Menand is very knowledgeable, but his lectures are more overview/background unless you push him with questions.</comment></course>GOV 94of: Law and Politics in Multicultural Democracies</title>This course is incredible. Ofrit is an amazing thinker and lecturer and is very friendly (if a little intimidating at first) with students. I found that this course challenged my worldview, challenged me academically (it is difficult, and you'll want to have done all the readings very carefully), and challenged my writing and research skills...basically everything you want out of a seminar! I also feel that I now have a very solid understanding of the intellectual background of the topic of the course, multiculturalism, law and politics. Be prepared to spend a lot of time talking about judicial review, however. Also in-class debates were low pressure and the writing assignments were easy and interesting since the topics were completely left up to us. Ofrit isn't often available outside of class, but make an effort to get to know her personally! Out of all my Harvard courses, this one ranks among the highest in my esteem.</comment>Ofrit is fantastic!</comment>This is a wonderful class, and you learn a lot about how the legal system works, how different cultures approach legal problems, and which problems / questions about multiculturalism and law persist. I do wish that we had more assignments though, just so we had more opportunities to get Ofrit's feedback and engage with the course material in different ways. Ofrit is a kind, approachable, and provocative instructor, and I really enjoyed the class.</comment>Be prepared to really work with the materials in this class, but you will come out have learned so much and knowing how to really engage with dense social science readings.</comment>You should have a strong interest in the law or the desire to learn a lot about the law. The class also rewards those who speak up in class. Liviatan's office hours are a must!!! They are limited too which really sucks. Make sure to cite the authors in class. Liviatan is big on "standing on the shoulders of giants"</comment>If you have the chance to take this course with Professor Livitan, please by all means do. Livitan is fantastic, dynamic, and engaging. If you're looking for a class that throws your arguments back in your face and teaches you how to think like a lawyer, this is it. I learned so much topically, and learned to think critically about the systems societies subscribe to. I loved this class. The workload was very manageable (two papers), and the discussions were never boring or irrelevant. The in-class simulations were hilarious and insightful.</comment>Be prepared for some challenging discussions. Professor Liviatan will expect and will demand your very best. But as long as you do your reading and show up prepared, it will be a very rewarding learning experience.</comment>Dr. Liviatan is a ton of fun.  She has high expectations and pushes you to think critically, which is makes for a good learning experience.</comment>The readings were organized in a way that brought us on an intellectual journey. I found that almost all the readings in this class re-molded the ways I think about judicial systems across the world. Ofrit is an organized and demanding lecturer, and she's willing to provide you with an enriching learning experience if you're willing to put in the work such an experience requires. My view of the American judicial system was tossed on its head by this class. If you want to open your mind, learn, and think critically about judicial systems, this is the course for you. Ofrit is also hilarious and a fantastic educator. This course, while unrelated to my focus field, gave me a more liberal understanding of the world. So, if that's your goal, take this course. I am not a Gov concentrator, though most were.</comment>This is a great course to take if you have already taken Constitutional Law (with Professor Richard Fallon), but some topics & cases you will read could be confusing if you do not have background knowledge. Expect that the majority of students would already be well-versed in law & legal issues.</comment></course>MODGRK 207: Topics in Modern Greek Studies</title>If you want to experience something exciting, thought-provoking, traversing the traditional boundaries between different fields this is one of the most intriguing seminars I've ever attended</comment>This was a great opportunity to engage in discussion very relevant to new directions in the field.</comment></course>ENG-SCI 239: Advanced Innovation in Science and Engineering: Conference Course</title>One of the best classes at Harvard.</comment></course>ECON 985q: Research in Applied Microeconomics, Environmental, and Natural Resource Economics</title>This course helps keep you on track for completing your thesis and not procrastinating</comment>Write a thesis! This is one of the only times at Harvard where you will be able to do just as you please-- and the possibilities for that are many! Writing a thesis will get you in touch with a wonderful professor and also acquaint you to how your peers are doing. Extremely important exercise at Harvard.</comment>The first thing you must consider when enrolling is the time commitment of a thesis. Rebecca is excellent for thesis writers and people serious about a single semester research paper. However, if you do not have a passion for what you are researching AND an advisor that supports you and pushes you at times, this course can get annoying or difficult.</comment>Rebecca is really helpful and invested in your thesis work. This pushes you to stay on a strict timeline where you are making clear progress throughout the semester, which culminates in a 25-page paper at the end of the semester.</comment>This class is a fantastic thesis tutorial. I have been continually impressed with how relevant the work in this class has been for helping me to progress with my thesis and the support offered by Rebecca is incredible. I would highly recommend this class for Ec and AM/Ec thesis writers- it will make the process so much more structured and painless.</comment>Mandatory for Economics thesis writers, this course forces you to progress in your thesis research.</comment>Fantastic way to write a thesis - the deadlines and support are invaluable.</comment></course>GOV 1074: Political Thought of the American Founding</title>The most enjoyable way I could have imagined fulfilling my gov theory requirement. Professor Nelson constructs a fascinating narrative around American history.</comment>It's a really interesting class. Just make sure you don't fall behind on work, because the midterm and final periods will really hit you then. I'd go over the lecture notes after he puts them up and maybe take notes on each person's position so you have a good outline of what's been said.</comment>This class is incredible. Though tough and with a ton of reading, its manageable and fair. It's also super interesting, you'll learn a ton from this class and Professor Nelson may be one of the best professors I've ever had (also the best dressed)</comment>This class was fabulous - Professor Nelson is one of the brightest teachers at Harvard, which is saying a lot, and both TF's were very friendly and capable. You're going to learn a ton about the American Revolution and the English Revolutions, read the most influential pamphlets and letters of the period, and, most importantly, come away from the class with an opinion about an incredibly formative era of our nation. Be ready to read up to 200 pages of 18th century writings a week, which is rough, but it'll be worth it.</comment>Be prepared to read!</comment>While reading thousands of pages of 17th and 18th century political philosophy is definitely a lot of work, there is a real payoff in this class.  It does a great job of examining and explaining the major intellectual debates driving the American Revolution, which enables you to gain a higher understanding of what the Revolution actually was.  Super interesting, and well-taught, course.</comment>Lots of readings, lecture is very straight forward.</comment>This class took a subject with which I felt reasonably familiar (the American founding) and made me think about it much more deeply and from a different perspective.  Prof. Nelson is a great lecturer and very passionate about the course material.  The readings (all primary source material from the founding period) can be intimidating at first, but you'll get better at extracting the key points from them after a few weeks.</comment>Professor Nelson is a great lecturer, and the material provides a genuine understanding of the American founding. The reading is heavy and entirely primary sources, but he breaks it down and provides helpful analysis during class.</comment>lots of reading, but worth it</comment>Lots of reading, but manageable. Prof. Nelson is such an engaging lecturer and makes the material interesting for anyone. I was never a fan of American history or political theory until this course.</comment>It's challenging, but ultimately very rewarding.</comment>Lecture is VERY helpful and VERY engaging!</comment>The material is really interesting but the reading can become overwhelming at times.</comment>Gov 1074 is a fantastic class for those who need to take care of their political theory requirement and are interested in the philosophical underpinnings behind our country's founding. Professor Nelson's lectures are compelling and crisp and the readings are excellent. Though there is a lot of reading (several hundreds of pages each week), all of it comes from primary sources and is worth your time!</comment>The course is really rewarding by the end, but the readings are difficult and numerous, and the grade breakdown puts a lot of pressure on both the midterm and the final.</comment>This class is the perfect mix of Gov-style theory and American history-based content. Be prepared that this class has a SIGNIFICANT amount of reading, and it's all primary sources. If you're a straight up Gov major, this class might seem extremely Hist/Lit focused, but personally, I extremely enjoyed it. Section is great for understanding the readings and picking out the important excerpts. Lecture is EXTREMELY important - I can't imagine how far behind you would be if you ever missed a lecture. Prof Nelson is a young superstar - one of the youngest tenured professors and graduated summa from Harvard, PhD from Cambridge - so understand that he knows EVERYTHING about this topic, and you would do well to meet with him even once to get to know him and make sure he knows you're serious about the course. PRO TIP: Buy his book, The Royalist Revolution - many parts of his lectures seem to be drawn word for word from parts of the book (lol) and it's extremely helpful when you're writing the take-home essay portion of the midterm and final. Also, it's generally a fantastic book! This class is exactly what it's advertised to be - about the history of political thought in early-modern Europe and America - no, it does NOT just focus on American history - so if you have background in early modern European history, you will be well prepared. This is a serious course, but you will get a LOT out of it if you take it seriously!</comment>Its a tough class, with a lot of reading, but has really interesting material.  If you are interested in the American Revolution or American history, this is a great class.</comment>An exceptional class that challenged my previous conceptions about the political thought of the Founding era.</comment>This class changed the way I think about the American Revolution and the forces that caused it. Reading only primary source documents can be difficult, but it allows you to get into the spirit of the time and the minds of the founders. Professor Nelson is a fast-paced, knowledge spewing lecturer and I would come out of every class filled with new ideas (and 3 pages of notes). The only downside to this class is its grading structure- with only a midterm, a final, and participation, most of the intense work is done within two weeks. Having papers due on the same day as exams made for a slightly unpleasant week, but the material was so interesting and the professor so engaging that this class is worth taking even with the difficult grading structure.</comment>Be prepared to read a LOT and think critically and analytically. This is hands down the best course I've taken yet at Harvard. Professor Nelson is flawless - smart, funny, and cares about his students (also has a great sense of style). The readings challenge your most basic assumptions about the United States and its Constitution. The wide range of prominent thinkers that are covered in this course will enhance your understanding of the key issues that led to American independence and the ratification of the U.S. Constitution. I would highly recommend this course to prospective law school students and people interested in political theory. That being said, there is a LOT of reading in this class and most of it is extremely dense and long-winded. Exams are not bad as long as you don't fall behind on the readings.</comment>Don't worry about the workload -- form a study group and it will be easier. This class is highly worth it if you want to learn about what our political founders were debating and thinking as they headed towards independence and then drafted our Constitution. Should be a must-take for any American. The primary sources are really interesting and Professor Nelson and the TFs do a great job synthesizing them and emphasizing the important points in lecture and section.</comment>the nature of the reading is difficult but Prof. Nelson does a lot to rectify this in the lectures. He makes it very easy to understand.</comment>Don't be intimidated by this class! The only week-to-week work is reading which, yes, can be quite dense, but Professor Nelson explains the readings very well in lecture and they're also reviewed in section. The midterm and final require some intense preparation but the grading is fair, and the quotes chosen for the IDs are straightforward - no one is trying to trick you. You'll read pieces of history that every American should read, and gain a new and different appreciation for the ideas on which our country is founded. One of the most rewarding and interesting classes I've taken during my four years at Harvard. No busy work and a fascinating subject. Professor Nelson is brilliant and a wonderful lecturer. Take this class!!!!!</comment>Take this course if you are interested in the very historic understanding of the early ideas influencing the US Constitution. The readings (all primary source 17th and 18th century English pamphlets) are very difficult, but the teaching staff (all great) provide a helpful overview of each one by the end of the term. This course does not include much of what you would expect from American Revolutionary history.</comment>This class is a lot of work and mass amounts of readings, but a great one for anybody interested in American history or politics during the time of the revolution. Lectures are detailed, interesting, and relevant, and the professor/TFs understand that there are a lot of difficult concepts and readings and are available outside of class. You need to put in the time to do the readings in this class, but you really come out of it with a new perspective on the American government.</comment>This is easily the hardest class I have taken here, and I question whether or not I actually enjoyed it. The material is interesting, but I am not sure if taking the course would be any better than getting Professor Nelson's book (which I haven't read, but it seems like it covers much of the material the course does). If you think you'll enjoy reading primary sources, I would ask you to make sure that you do before you take this class, because that's all you'll be doing.</comment></course>COMPSCI 143: Computer Networks</title>This class is good for people who learn better by doing stuff (as opposed to by reading or listening to lectures), since even for the reading you have to complete a short quiz which helps you get a better idea of how to think about the material, and there are significant programming projects. I think it's a vast improvement on traditional computer networks courses since we weren't just reading 30-year-old RFCs for weeks on end, we were learning about relevant technologies today that we'll be working with when we enter the job force. The main drawback is that the teaching staff were pretty disorganized and it seemed like assignments were always getting thrown together right before we got them. This was the first offering of the revamped course though, so in future years it may be less of a logistical mess.</comment>Hopefully, they will make this class better/organized in the future. Granted it was in its first stage of redevelopment, but it still felt too disorganized for a class. I loved that we got to interact with Dr. Kung and the teaching fellows who were amazing, responsive, accessible, and helpful. The class itself needs so much work especially in terms of material and assignments. I think more of programming assignments like the one given (there is only one), but shorter and more organized would be better than the quizzes (which need to be clearer and have a uniform answer key so we can study for quizzes). I felt like there was a lot expected out of us for the final project even though the fundamentals were not taught well at all. I understand the goal of this course, but it was honestly too ambitious and disorganized. I would not recommend taking the class until these issues are fully addressed.</comment>I took this course because I wanted to fill a void in my knowledge regarding networks. While I did learn some from the course, I gained all that knowledge from textbook readings that I could have done on my own. I found it really hard to learn anything during lectures. HT Kung is brilliant but it is sometimes hard to understand what he is saying or how he is explaining concepts. That being said, the course is not very demanding. And it will give you motivation to read a textbook about networks. Also, some of the more modern things we talked about (e.g. vehicular networks) were pretty cool towards the end of the semester.</comment>This class gave an interesting introduction to the field of computer networks. Do not expect to learn (much) implementation-level networking stuff though; you should view this class as research into what modern networks are like, and what opportunities/challenges exist in this realm. You will also have the opportunity to dive into one aspect of networks in a group final project of your own design. Overall I would say this is a unique type of CS course at Harvard that isn't for everyone, but could be, provided you go into the course with realistic expectations.</comment>This class is a great introduction to networks, but Kung doesn't really speak English so he can't articulate much. He is great and seems to care about network but the language barrier is almost unbearable.</comment>I would say if you're interested in the material, try to learn it yourself. This course is poorly structured and you'll end up learning very little of the material. Everything you learn is despite of how it's organized, not because of how it's organized. They through a ton of readings at you and you have to complete quizzes for every class (and you're given a very short amount of time to complete them). There's only one programming assignment in a semester and there's almost no assistance for doing it. It doesn't feel like a CS class at all, but like a poorly organized ged ed.</comment>Lectures can be bad and they assign an overwhelming amount of readings sometimes, but the material is very good to know -- it fills a very big gap in most students' CS knowledge</comment>The topics we go over in this class are actually quite relevant and interesting. Dr. Kung is a brilliant computer scientist and he knows so much about computer networks. However, the class itself was extremely unorganized. You could tell it was because the TFs took over 3 weeks to hand back quizzes, some were never returned, project instructions were given the week before, etc. You have to really read your textbook and the assigned papers if you want to learn anything (and believe me this stuff IS ACTUALLY RELEVANT despite what the class makes it seem like) or pass the quizzes / midterm. Make sure your final project is understandable and that you are making some real world application. My advice: instead of doing something that sounds complicated and involving gazillions of algorithms and protocols, do something simple that a normal, non-CS person would understand and use. (Think about how you'd apply network technologies in everyday life). Dr. Kung seems to like projects that serve a tangible purpose in the real world. Other than that, nothing was hard.</comment>Great lectures and really interesting materials. Assignments and final project are a tad disorganized</comment>Kung is the man and the TFs were relatively accessible and helpful, but unfortunately the course, which was undergoing a ton of updates and changes to be fair, simply lacked focus and tried to teach way too much.  If they can narrow the scope of the class and have it organized better, I'd recommend it since some of the papers you read are very interesting and it definitely has some real value. Unfortunately, the course does have issues and is not a painless CS course.</comment>Really interesting course. The format takes some getting used to though: don't expect much by way of course structure. Make sure to do the bi-weekly quizzes, it's a great way to get the material to stick.</comment>This class was a mess. Dr. Kung's lectures were always well attended, but by students who were just on their phones or laptops all the time. The readings for this class were completely unnecessary. You can just google the midnight quiz questions. I didn't think it was possible, but this is a CS class that you can just basically BS your way through without having learned anything along the way (besides some networking buzzwords). In retrospect, this class is pretty easy (especially in terms of grading), but, if you actually want to know about networks, just cross-register at MIT instead.</comment>This class has a ton of busy work when you aren't doing the programming assignment or project.</comment>If you are looking for a course with little work during the semester, then this class will probably be annoying but bearable. If your primary motive is something else (like learning about networking) you will likely be disappointed.</comment>Computer networks are a very essential part of CS. Since there is currently no other good substitute for this class that teaches networks and distributed systems, this is a must take. The course could be more organized, but you pretty much get what you put into it.</comment>Not very structured, but some interesting material</comment>One of the worst courses I have taken at Harvard. The class is very poorly organized. Don't take it, unless new prof. teaches it. Cool material though.</comment>Study day by day.</comment>It's a pretty boring course, you could just watch the videos that we have to watch and learn most important things. Not too much guidance is given during the final projects but you have to do 3 presentations? Overall, the work you put in is not worth what you get out.</comment>Material is extremely interesting and grounded in current events. However, the lack of organisation is astonishing. It's impossible to plan ahead and a lot of things are made up on the fly, but definitely learned a ton and would recommend the class.</comment>The quiz format/schedule was very annoying.  Did not get much out of lectures.  Overall, the class kind of felt like a mess.</comment></course>HIST 3900: Writing History: Approaches and Practices</title>This course provides an engaging overview of major currents in modern historical, humanistic, and social scientific thought for students beginning their professional careers. Though the volume of reading included in the syllabus sometimes limits the possibility for detailed discussions of individual texts, the course will nevertheless leave students with a heightened, valuable awareness of the questions and conundrums that they will face in their scholarly undertakings.</comment>More diversity.</comment>3900 is a rite of passage. The point is to get to know your cohort and to wrestle with ideas about the place of the historian in society and the academy, to figure out how you think of yourself as a historian, etc. -- what we actually read is almost beside the point. Go to every class, attending discussion is very important, but if you have to prioritize outside work for one course below the others, make it this one.</comment>This is a required course, of course, so my recommendation functionally means little. However, I would still recommend it even if it were not required, as it has much to offer for those wishing to learn about historical theory and theoretically minded historians.</comment>Don't succumb to the grad student temptation to complain about 3900 - it's a great course, taught by excellent and dedicated faculty.</comment>Everything you always wanted to know about history but were too afraid to ask!</comment></course>ENGLISH 350: Teaching Colloquium</title>The course feels belated in the program -- the teaching advice comes either simultaneously or ex post facto, and the professionalization advice given here is, in general, advice we should have been considering far in advance, OR it's specific advice to the job market that we don't need yet.</comment></course>GOV 94ha: The Political Science of American Democracy</title>This is mean, but what really pulls this course down is the kids who take it. The quality of discussion sucks. It's a Gov seminar, and the easiest one... so arguably the easiest major, and the easiest seminar, and you have a decent number of kids looking to coast. Harvey taught interesting things. But we just listened to him because everyone had lackluster ideas to interrupt with, and not many people read.</comment>This is one of the best classes (if not the best class) I have ever taken. I would absolutely recommend it!</comment>The highlight of this course is getting to hear Prof Mansfield's analysis on the Federalist and Democracy in America. A student will get as much out of this course as he puts in.</comment>not only will you learn a lot... you'll also laugh a lot</comment></course>LITER 96: Grounds for Comparison</title>The syllabus for this course was simply perfect. The cross-cultural lenses, the balance of theory and "literature," the balance of media (novels, lyrics, films, short stories), and the balance of time periods were crafted with great diligence. Prof. Damrosch facilitated discussed wonderfully, balancing breadth with depth. It was one of the most memorable courses I have taken at Harvard.</comment>Lit 96 offers a great introduction to the field of Comparative Literature. Taught as a small seminar, the course covers global literatures from several different time periods and regions of the world. Each week has a central theme and focuses on several primary texts and secondary pieces of criticism. The reading list— generally excerpts or short texts—is, however, very manageable, so it is very possible to complete all the readings in great detail.   Professor Damrosch also leads effective seminars, balancing student discussions and his suggestions about the texts. The topics are fascinating and often related to issues in philosophy, politics, and cultural studies. In addition, Professor Damrosch is very approachable for help with assignments or questions about readings or the course in general. Compared to many introductory or survey courses in literature, this is one of the more accessible courses—even to those concentrating in non-humanities fields—so if comparative literature is of any interest, I suggest taking this course as it is compelling, comprehensible, and reasonable in its workload.</comment>This class is low-stress. Professor Damrosch obviously loves what he's teaching, and he includes materials you wouldn't get in a more conventional literature course. He gives a good survey of the comparative aspect of comparative literature, bringing texts from very different backgrounds and putting them side by side.</comment>This course is a great introduction to literary theory and is perfect for anyone thinking about concentrating in literature. I would definitely recommend it!</comment>A breathtaking romp across the continents, between the genres, and through the millennia. You’ll read Derrida, Bob Marley, Kalidasa, and others under the tutelage of a Professor who is more magician than pedant—a brilliant reader who manages to be as entertaining as he is instructive, and who prefers to guide the readings of the class rather than impose his own, explicitly or implicitly.</comment></course>FRSEMR 30z: George Orwell: Journalist, Essayist, and Conscience of an Age</title>You have to spend time reading and forming your own opinions on Orwell's work, and you should be prepared to express these ideas clearly.</comment>This course is very good, but you'll have to stick it out for a few bad readings. Professor Kishlansky makes George Orwell accessible and comprehensible, and is quite funny as well. You don't need to have read Orwell previously to take this course, either.</comment>This was by far my favorite class this semester. George Orwell seems like a very narrow topic, but the readings extend to history, literature, political ideologies, etc. There is a lot of reading (ranging from a few short essays to more than a book a week), but can be quick reads because they're so interesting. Professor Kishlansky may seem a little intimidating at first, but the seminars have a very genial atmosphere, with debates on very complex issues often broken with personal anecdotes and occasional jokes. You learn a lot from the professor: he makes sure you know what you are saying, values your opinion, and always offers very interesting insights into the works. Lastly, Orwell himself is a fascinating character with some great works that are sure to cause some personal reflection, especially during your first semester at Harvard. Definitely take this seminar!</comment>Prof Kishlansky is the best professor I've had at Harvard. He asks the best questions while subtly facilitating really rewarding discussion. You won't look at or think about Orwell/literature/politics in the same way after this class. Take this class or you will regret it-- if not for the opportunity to get to know Professor Kishlansky a little bit.</comment>I highly recommend this class. Professor Kishlansky is a great guy, especially once you get used to his humor, and there is so much you can learn from Orwell.</comment>You can make your way through weekly seminar without reading the works, but it's such a waste of this course to not do the reading. Some weeks it's only about 40-50 pages, others it's 200+, but it's always incredible reading and always makes for a better seminar experience. Professor Kishlansky is a bit offputting in his bluntness at first (I think we all walked out the first seminar kind of wondering what we'd got ourselves into), but he's the best discussion leader I've ever seen in my life. He'll never let you make a lazy point and you'll fight for every inch of your arguments but it's never in an aggressive way, he's just making sure you know why you're saying what you're saying. His love for Orwell is obvious and infectious. A great seminar.</comment>Do the readings and you will have a very rewarding academic experience.</comment>Have a sense of humor and don't take anything Prof Kishlansky says personally!</comment>What a great and interesting class, fantastic way to transfer into freshman year. Be ready to read a fair amount, but when the reading's so fantastic, who could complain.</comment>If you get in, take this course. Professor Kishlansky offers witty and insightful commentary to the weekly reading discussions, and he instantly became my favorite professor at Harvard. You will read 1984 and Animal Farm with a new understanding of Orwell's true identity and motivations. Professor Kishlansky creates a comfortable but often critical atmosphere, and you will learn to appreciate your classmates. Take the class! Can't get enough of Kishlansky.</comment></course>HAA 289p: Sotatsu</title>Great body of materials and great course.</comment>Sotatsu (the artist that the course focuses on) is not really a "fine arts" artist in the conventional sense. He works in the decorative arts, and yet he has elevated his craftsmanship into the realm of fine arts.</comment></course>LIFESCI 2: Evolutionary Human Physiology and Anatomy</title>This is an absolutely amazing class. It inspired me to be premed, it inspired me to change some of my life habits, and it taught me many things. Furthermore, it was extremely fun, the professors and TFs are wonderful, and you sound very classy when you have to go to UHS and can use lots of big medical words.</comment>This class is an excellent overview of how the body works. Despite what many think, this class is certainly not limited to pre-med students or science concentrators, though I have heard that this class is very similar to what you would take in medical school. As one of the few non-science major and non-pre-med students in this class, I definitely lacked a solid biology or chemistry background compared to others, and had to put in extra time to understand what the basic concepts and terms meant, but overall found most of the material to be clear and manageable if you put in the necessary effort. Most of the material, once you understand it, is memorization-based. You do have to keep in mind that this class is very heavy in workload- as many others would say, the lectures and labs are like two different classes because there is just so much to do for each portion. However, this class has definitely peaked my interest in the sciences and has even had me question my major. The labs are fascinating (dissections!), and the lectures are taught very well. The class is very fast-paced and a lot of material is squeezed into the semester, so don't take on too many other commitments and hard classes for the semester.</comment>If you know you're interested in anatomy, this class is excellent. If you love dissection, take this class. Lab and lecture can feel like two different classes, but all of the material is interesting and exciting. Definitely plan to spend a lot of time/energy on this class, because there's a lot of material to cover.</comment>LS2 is at times awesome, and at times frustrating. To start with the positives, the lecturers are pretty good, among the most understandable at Harvard! If you're taking LS2, hopefully you find the material interesting, and except for a few lectures, that is definitely true. You'll leave the course with a good understanding of introductory anatomy and phys, important for the MCAT and future learning. As for negatives, be prepared to spend a decent chunk of time in office hours, which are pretty crucial for doing well on lab exams in which you must identify features (bones, muscles, etc.). This additional time can be rather frustrating, but seeing the organisms/bones multiple times is fairly necessary. Exams are what you'd expect. Get to know the TFs a little bit and you'll enjoy the course.</comment>This course will consume your life. It is basically two courses in one: there is the material from lectures that you need to know for the exams, and there is the material from lab that you need to know for practicals. You will need to re watch every lecture on your own because it moves so fast. That being said, I learned so much and was always interested. It is just an absurd amount of information and if you don't put the time in you won't do well.</comment>Overall, I am really happy that I took LS 2 even though at times it was difficult. Also, Dr. Carr is really helpful if you go to her for extra help! Thanks Dr. Carr.</comment>The material is interesting but the workload is unreal. Lab is basically like you are taking a fifth class. Stay on top of studying for lab practicals and go to office hours to study for them so you can look at the cats. Be prepared to study a lot for all lab practicals, midterms, and especially the final exam.</comment>I would tell people that this class is very interesting, but a ton of work.  Both lecture and lab are awesome in their own rights, and you learn a lot, but it's almost like taking two different classes because they don't line up and both require a substantial amount of time and effort.</comment>You won't do as well as you'd hoped, but if you put in the time for it every week-you'll love it. Go to lectures in person because theyre a million times better than the filmed version. Also the lab component is alot and you have to go to office hours--so you're taking two classes.</comment>You learn a lot, but you also have to memorize a lot. The material is fascinating and you really gain an appreciation for how the human body works. Even though there are no psets, the practicals/assignments take you just as much time. The 3-hour lab you have for this class is more like 6 hours because office hours are no optional, almost required, to do well on the practicals. The atmosphere in the class is pretty tense since most people, if not all, are premeds. But I do think it is of great benefit, for MCAT and med school, to enter having taken an anatomy course.</comment>Great class with excellent lecturers! Be prepared to spend time outside of class preparing for the lab practicals.</comment>The course is difficult, but if you can keep up with the readings, attend lecture and review, review, review, the material is so interesting and so worth it. I loved learning about how the body works, and labs were great for reinforcing that.</comment>This course was fascinating, but it was a lot of work and a lot of memorization, which takes time. It definitely teaches you how to study, but a lot of people have to learn how to do this class the hard way, when it is too late to do well.</comment>It is a great class, extremely interesting content, but can be difficult at times. Overall strongly recommended</comment>This class covers a lot of material, and it can be hard to go through and make sure you understand how all the concepts tie together. But there isn't as much memorization as people say! If you really get how everything you talk about works together (and the professors do a good job in helping you understand that), there really isn't much memorization at all, apart from the  practicals.</comment>The class is difficult but a must if you are premed.  You should not go to medical school without taking this course.  I would feel at a disadvantage had I not taken the course.  You learn so much!  It was difficult but really fun at the same time.  labs are enjoyable although the practicals are intense in terms of how much you need to study for them.  The professors are amazing, they know their stuff!</comment>This is a difficult class, but you will come out of it knowing a ton about how the human body works</comment>Useful class with meaningful labs (a lot of classes don't have very good labs but this one is different!)</comment>This course is interesting especially if you are interested in the human body, but it is a lot of work. The professors are awesome and in my opinion the lectures were interesting.  The lab component of the class has almost weekly practicals which involves memorizing a lot of information and being able to identify different body parts. It took several hours a week to memorize the information and attend office hours. There is also a lot of material in the class which takes time to learn for the midterms. With that being said, this isn't the time commitment of organic chemistry. I still had plenty of free time. If I were to do this class again I probably would study for the midterm for a week instead of two days before the exam.</comment>The lecture part of class isn't a lot of work but the labs are an insane amount of work. I spent more time on labs alone than I have on any other class period. The Head TF is really nice and helpful. The professors are nice. I'm happy I took this class cause it will definitely help with the MCAT.</comment>This is a class that is challenging and will require that you put time and work into it, but it is very interesting in general, and you learn some really cool, applicable things. The labs are also very neat!</comment>You will learn the most in this class than you've probably learned in any other class. The information is all really applicable to every aspect of your life, and it's incredibly cool and rewarding to understand how the body works when you are going for a run or digesting food or really any physiological process. This class takes up a TON of time. It is not an easy course by any means, but if you stay proactive in your practicals and work hard at really understanding the material before the tests, you'll learn a lot and do well. Definitely a rewarding class in the end.</comment>Be prepared for a lot of work--rewarding work, though!</comment>This class is hard. There is a lot of work involved, which is fine because the topics are so interesting. However, be prepared for the logistical challenges of lab, and the rather terrible time-crunch during the midterms. If you go to lecture, stay engaged during lab, and do the work, your grade will end up fine, but it still requires a significant time/energy investment. That said, the professors are great, the lectures are interesting, and the material is AWESOME!</comment>This is a rewarding but challenging course, so better come with interest and be prepared.</comment>Only take this course if you're not afraid of memorization and</comment>This is a fantastic course. It really is. You will learn a tremendous amount about the human body, and will leave with a huge sense of accomplishment. However, be prepared to work. HARD. The practicals are hard, as are the tests.</comment>plan time well</comment>I thoroughly enjoyed LS2. I found the content extremely interesting and enjoyed how we talked about human anatomy and function as well as public health and exercise. I also appreciate the fact that we covered so many topics during the semester-- I think it provided a great overview of the things to expect in medical school. The lab is a whole other class on its own with practicals and lab assignments, however these are pretty manageable. Studying for midterms was a bit of a challenge since we covered so much ground throughout the semester, but if you space it out it shouldn't be too bad. That being said, this class is a lot of work, so be careful not to overload yourself with this and other difficult courses.</comment>If you are pre-med, this course is a must. If you are not pre-med, this course might be the one science course worth taking. It's tough, but it changes the way you think about the human body.</comment>This class has a very heavy workload. If you're interested in the topic, it's a fascinating, well-taught class, but be prepared to try and memorize more information than you probably ever have before.</comment>You absolutely MUST keep yourself accountable for the lecture material totally separate from lab and practical review. The midterms and final are comprised exclusively of content learned in lecture and the absence of psets means that the class in no way keeps you accountable for what is truly a massive amount of information.</comment>Though this course may be one of the hardest courses I have taken at Harvard, it has been hands down the most worthwhile. I've learned so much and truly feel like an intelligent human being.</comment>Be prepared to teach yourself many topics.</comment>only take if you are ready for the amount of work and independent study required for this class. It was interesting, but often times it was also brute memorization and can be very not fun. taking it with a class that was mostly premed also made it very stressful and since it is curved, you really have to force yourself to do well - added pressure makes the material seem less interesting at the time.</comment>The labs are the best part of the class!</comment>You will probably have to put an insane amount of work into this class; it's essentially two separate courses (anatomy in lab and physiology in lecture) and while there is obviously overlap it's a LOT of material. Absolutely worth it because labs are awesome and the material is great (and you probably have to take this if you're pre-med anyway), but be prepared to spend a lot of time on this class.</comment>Lab and Lectures are separate/treat like 2 classes. Rewarding for sure, but memorization seems to be valued more so than understanding (the final can be forgiving). Do take it if you have a genuine interest/wish to learn--that you will do.</comment>You will learn an incredible amount in LS2 but it won't always be fun.  This class actually operates like 2 classes, with the lab and the lecture being extremely disconnected.  Lab practicals every week require A LOT of stuyding.  Also, don't put off studying until the last minute for exams, it'll really hurt you.  That being said, the professors and Dr. Carr are all fantastic people!</comment>If you want to go to medical school, you will need to take anatomy at a much deeper level, so this class isn't too helpful in that regard--especially since it's so memorization heavy that the likelihood you'll remember any of the info a semester out is minimal. The lab is literally like a separate class, and the midterms test the most random minutiae that unless you need this class for something, I would hesitate to recommend it. That said, for the most part, the professors really try to present anatomy in a very integrative, evolutionarily-focused manner, which is unique and refreshing.</comment>Great material and very interesting, but between lab and class, the workload is quite heavy.  Always, he amount of material is immense and reviewing after each lecture is essential to truly understand.</comment>This class will stress you out to no end and take up a ton of your time. The exams are extremely hard and difficult to prepare for. There are no problem sets, which is a bad thing because you don't know what's expected of you until the midterms. There aren't many assignments, so you have to have the discipline to actually sit down and study without getting a grade for it. You have to memorize a ton for lab, and the lab tests (practicals) are unfair and stressful. The lab reports are graded extremely strictly, but without telling you what is expected. However, you will learn a lot about anatomy (but never enough to do well on exams). It is very interesting, but that is drowned out by the extreme stress it will cause you.</comment>Be ready for a ton of work. That said, WHOA THIS WAS GREAT! Loved lab SO MUCH! You get to dissect cats and sharks and lampreys and sheep brains and calf plucks...it was great!</comment>It's a very interesting class and with lots of information but it requires a whole lot of work.</comment>You need to put in the work, but it's incredibly rewarding at the end of it all.</comment>LS2 is great preparation for the MCAT. It is an extremely well-structured and well-taught. All of the professors are fantastic. One of the best big science lecture classes at Harvard. My one complaint is that the materials for the final were not sufficient. More thorough answer keys would be very helpful. The questions in the second section were very vague.</comment>grading is harsh, sections tend to be meh, lots of memorizing, great labs</comment>TAKE THIS CLASS. Yes, I know all the other comments say that it's like taking two classes because lab takes so much time, but IT'S WORTH IT. This is hands down one of my favorite Harvard classes- it is pretty well taught (material is dense and might be a little all over the place on occasion) but it is so super relevant and interesting, and if you even think you may want to go to med school, take this class and see if med school is actually for you! The memorizing is a lot but it works your brain well and you will get in the groove if you start strong right at the beginning. Take this for sure if you need an extra biology for pre med reqs.</comment>You will learn a lot in this class that will be useful for the MCAT, a career in medicine, and/or HEB concentration. However, to do well on the practicals/exams, you have to be willing to put in a lot of work. Going to lab office hours is necessary.</comment>This class is fantastic! It covers a lot of material, but the lab is really interesting (and different from most other science labs!) and the lecturers are very engaging. If you have an interest in how the human body develops and functions, regardless of whether or not you're a premed, take this class!</comment>Incredibly interesting material on the human body. I've taken an anatomy course in the past and I still learned A LOT. Lab is fun and informative; a great way to apply lecture material to reality. 

Course takes a lot of meticulous studying (like orgo). It resembles medical school difficulty. So challenge yourself if you're premed. Took orgo and this consecutively (but took a 4th class p/f) and it was definitely manageable, just requires efficient studying: review lecture slides before lecture, reviewing lecture notes, attending all lectures, you know the deal.

If you're interested in the human body, you will love this course.</comment>This class is a great introduction to human anatomy in an evolutionary sense.  The material is very interesting, but there is a ton of it.  You don't have to spend a lot of time doing p sets which is nice but you will have to study a lot for the midterms and lab practicals.</comment>Lot of memorization, mainly for premeds</comment>Lab/Practicals are horrible.</comment>this class was a struggle for life and often left me in tears and fits of rage, but I have to say it is an incredibly great feeling to know how the entire body works, I have learned more relevant, fascinating material in this class than any other as a pre-med student.</comment>Great lecturers, long labs/practicals/preparation in OH but worth it!</comment>Overall it's a great class, but be prepared to work hard. The lectures are fascinating, and the midterms are long but fair. Dr. Carr is intimidating, but she's surprisingly kind and helpful when you meet with her one-on-one. The lab is very disorganized and could use significant improvement. The labs themselves are great, but are pretty much a totally separate class that requires much more work than and is not terribly connected to the course itself. The labs do not prepare you well to succeed on the practicals, which are extremely difficult.</comment>LS2 has a lot of work to do before it's anywhere near a reasonable or well-structured introductory anatomy course. Lab practicals are stressful and test the memorization of hundreds of names of bones, bone details, muscles, and muscle origins and insertions. You're given a week to memorize them, then they are scarcely mentioned again. The lectures are good enough, but sometimes far, far too basic. 

You will spend ten hours a week on this class, minimum.</comment>It's a very very difficult course- super time intensive. At times, you might feel frustrated with how much is required of you/how much you're expected to know. The exams are also very tough and no matter how much you study, it's difficult to do well on them. That said, you do learn a lot.</comment>best pre-med class hands down</comment>Try to maintain stamina throughout the whole course because it requires putting in the effort for each lab practical and test. This is one of the most straightforward science classes I have taken at Harvard. You just have to sit there and learn the shit.</comment>This was a very harshly graded class.  The Lab practicals are sorta miserable to study for.  The problem with this class is that the material is incredibly interesting and the lectures are actually alright.  However, the class is such a weed-out class that the enthusiasm isn't reflected in the grades.</comment>It's a lot of work -- straight up memorizing everything from lecture.  Section (lab) is basically another class because you're learning additional material and doing extra assignments that do not directly relate to lecture material.  I suggest taking a light courseload in addition to LS2.  All the material is super helpful for the MCAT though if you're planning on taking that shortly thereafter taking this course.</comment>In the first day of lecture, professor Ellison told us that taking LS2 would be like "trying to take a drink of water out of a fire hydrant" and we just had to absorb as much as we possibly could. I think that is an excellent way to describe the challenging but incredibly satisfying experience of LS2. I have never learned more in a class (at any point in my academic career) than I did in LS2. LS2 is incredibly demanding, time consuming, and comprehensive, but you will leave the class feeling like you have a true understanding of human physiological processes and how they relate to evolution. 

I am very happy that I chose to take LS2 this semester rather than an "easier" or less work-intensive biology requirement (for pre-med requirements). It will take a lot of work (many hours outside of class), but if you think you want to go to medical school, I think this class is imperative. It will either affirm your will to be a medical school student or scare you away from the profession. My only caution would be if you know you will not be able to spend time reviewing lectures outside of class. It is easy to let lecture material build up without review, but if you let that happen, exams will be impossible to study for. This might seem obvious, but it can be difficult to make yourself study lectures when the class requires you to spend sometimes 8 + hours a week studying for lab practicals outside of class meeting times. Be careful not to fall into the trap of feeling like "you're doing enough" and then using that feeling to justify not spending time reviewing weekly material. If you allot the appropriate amount of time to this class, you will leave the class feeling like you've accomplished something big and you will gain an incredible understanding of the way in which the human body evolved.</comment>Really interesting course, but only take if you're willing to make this the priority of your semester. Going to office hours is almost necessary to do well on the practicals and exams. Also requires studying week to week, not just close to the exam. The benefit of the class is that if you put in enough time/effort, you should be able to do well</comment>This is a very challenging and work-intensive course, but if you put the hours into it, you can do well.  The labs are interesting and hands on, but the practicals take a lot of time to study for.  Make sure you go to office hours to look at the real specimens.  Also, Dr. Carr is a great resource; go to her office hours with questions about lecture material and she will help you greatly.</comment>Super interesting, a ton of work. A TON. Do not take it as a 5th. It's basically two courses in one.</comment>Yes, LS2 is absurdly difficult. Yes, lab is literally an extra class (you will spend more time in office hours than in lab each week to adequately prepare for practicals and to write lab reports) that has little overlap with lecture. If you are me or someone equally masochistic, you will often wonder "why did I decide to take this class as a concentration elective? I'm not even premed!" But then you will get to discover how the human body works/develops, and dissect tons of things, and have cool lab demonstrations and experiments, and basically challenge yourself to learn about something that is actually important and gain a new appreciation for the incredible beauty and complexity of life. I got really excited about this class all the time because I'm a huge nerd--the goal is to not get stressed out by it! Just relax and accept that you will not get an A unless you kill yourself with work or are some kind of freakish prodigy.</comment>Do not take this class with orgo or PS 2. It will kill you. The labs are hard and the way you do well is to go into office hours repeatedly to ensure you remember what you will be tested on that week for your practicals. Memorize (brutally) every single slide because you could be tested on it. It is overwhelming but great prep for MCAT.</comment>hard, but worthwhile</comment>Best way to fulfill the bio requirement of premed I think. Enjoyable lectures from very good professors, and not a huge workload (no problem sets, just lab practicals/reports)</comment>Be ready to spend a lot of time on this class. As far as learning and lecture go though, this class was great! Just time consuming</comment>This was a wonderful class. The professors were insightful and keen on making sure students understood the material and its significance.</comment>This class is extremely interesting, however requires a great amount of studying.</comment>Supposedly this class will be very helpful for the MCAT. It goes really fast bc most schools teach LS2 in two terms instead of one. Lab is not always in tandem with lecture so really make flashcards and keep up with lectures from the start. Always be on your game for both lab and lecture and go to OH all the time. Go in the beginning of the week!</comment>Make sure you talk to people about the synthesis questions for the final.  Do the practice problems for the final as well. some items were verbatim.  The first exam it is important to do well in because the 2nd exam is typically harder but people tend to score better because they scored poorly on the first due to insufficient studying.  Study the practice exams for those are a good indicator of what style and how specific the exams can be.  I would rewatch the lectures and write detailed notes on them (splitting this up with people in a group google doc is key). i didn't do this and I regret it but I still enjoyed the class itself. Very time intensive class with physiology in lab taking up a lot of time.</comment>I really enjoyed this class, but it was quite difficult. This class requires a lot of studying and a lot of work. Lectures focus on physiology while labs focus on anatomy, and though the two overlap from time to time, it can feel like two different classes at times. However, it really was a wonderful class. I learned so much in just a semester. Having learned a great deal about the body and how it works through lectures and dissections, I can honestly say this is the greatest pre-med experience I've had here yet.</comment>It's really great material, but it's a lot of work. If you don't need the class for credit, I would not recommend it</comment>This class taught me so, so much about the human body. While it was quite time consuming and had a heavy workload, this class overall was worth it if you want to learn about how the body functions. It's a great class to fulfill the pre-med requirement as the labs are very engaging and fun.</comment>This class covers a huge amount of information which is good and bad. Good, because you will learn a lot and gain appreciation for the complexity of the human body and other organisms. Bad, because unlike other universities, Harvard teaches anatomy and physiology together in one class. Taking LS2 is like taking two classes together at once. For lab, office hours are not optional if you want to do well. For lecture, study lectures regularly and early.</comment>Beware that the lab component of this class takes enough time to be a separate class; budget your schedule accordingly. Otherwise, lectures are recorded, professors and teaching staff are pleasant and helpful.  Would not take as an elective.</comment>It is A LOT of time.  Beware!  It is also can be very difficult to understand and digest all the material (the lecture component).  If you are up for the challenge though you will definitely learn a lot. It was one of my favorite classes here, despite my struggles.</comment>This course just takes a TON of time. Make sure you can devote enough time to it, and you'll do well. Books are useless, office hours are essential.</comment>This course was by far the most interesting and amazing course I have taken at Harvard. I really loved the material, the professors, and the TFs. The assignments were really fun and rewarding. This class does, however, require a lot of time. The human body is amazing, but complex and it requires a lot of memorization to get it down. The lab practicals aren't bad, but you have to memorize a lot. The exams are mainly rote memorization. The final added an applicative component, which was nice. I love this course!</comment>Be prepared for the lab!</comment>It is hard. Ridiculously hard. Lab and lecture are like 2 different classes with their own material and their own examinations. And the class definitely is not nice to you, it is not understanding. It expects a certain amount from you, and if you don't achieve, they're not going to give you an A because you tried. But damn, do you learn a lot. It is a fascinating class and I feel like I have learned some of the most interesting and applicable stuff that I will get out of any Harvard class. Basically: try hard, take advantage of the amazing TFs and their office hours, start studying early, and don't take another premed class at the same time.</comment></course>ANE 117: Biblical Archaeology</title>If, like me, you use the frequency of "aha!" moments in a course to determine it's worth, this is as close to a perfect class as you'll find. There is learning that pushes the borders of your understanding, and there is learning that erases those borders entirely and draws completely new lines. The former should be expected in any class, but the latter is hard to find. This course had both, and in abundance. I would give it my highest recommendation to any student, regardless of academic interest, and without reserve.</comment></course>SOC-STD 98li: Protest and Conflict in Asia</title>This was an incredible class. I almost don't want to tell you how great it is, because I love that it was a 4 person class which made it all the more special. But for your sake: Kevin if absolutely brilliant, and cares deeply about teaching. He is always available to meet and talk. He also remembers almost everything he has every read and thus is an incredible resource. In terms in the class, I wouldn't be deterred if you have no interest in protest, violence, or Asia. These are merely entry points to Kevin's overall project which is to get students to reconsider the basic categories or "technologies of difference" through which we see and divide the world. He is also deeply invested in making students "intellectual attack dogs" aka critical thinkers. I highly recommend going through the Caffrey Boot Camp.</comment>Especially if you are a Social Studies concentrators, you would really miss out if you did not take any courses taught by Kevin Caffrey. This one focuses on East Asia but it teaches you the framework to understand and break down issues of ethnicity, nationality, race and gender.</comment>The best class I have taken here. Prepare to be challenged and do not shy away from it.</comment>Definitely take this class - Kevin teaches you to think critically and to challenge the assumptions you hold about all sorts of issues. Caffrey's experiences doing ethnographic and anthropological field research in southeast Asia clearly informs his teaching. The readings are phenomenal, especially when you get to the second half of the course and read papers related to your research topic. However, be aware that there is quite a bit of reading (all manageable though) and the weekly session can feel a little long and tedious towards the end of the 2 hours. Sometimes it feels like Kevin is just rambling on about his life experiences rather than actually teaching us the tools we need to succeed on the final paper. That being said, his stories are great and inspiring! Take this course!</comment></course>SOC-STD 98ax: Development and Modernization: A Critical Perspective</title>This course will give you a whole new lens through which you can ask questions about the world and the way our society is constructed. It will make you uncomfortable and unsettled about the way that you've been thinking about these things so far. Readings are all gems, as was what Prof. Marglin has to say about everything. Recommend with both thumbs up!</comment>What an incredibly thought-provoking, challenging, and eye-opening experience this course has been. Both the readings and the class itself are phenomenal! Professor Marglin is wonderful at facilitating class discussions, and I really appreciated the kindness and support he showed us throughout. The readings really changed me; they disproved many of my preconceptions and got me thinking about things I had never considered before. A word of caution: you simply cannot thrive in this course, or allow it to change you, if you don't do the readings!! Make sure you devote enough time and energy to completing them each week. I promise you will be blown away by this course if you do that :)</comment>The readings were excellent, and I feel like I learned quite a lot about a wide variety of topics. It was a very Social Studies-ish course in the sense that there were a nice mix of readings/ideas from history, anthro, sociology, poli sci, philosophy, social theory, etc. The seminars varied, with some weeks being very interesting/lively and others pretty dull. I would have preferred more structure/guidance in terms of writing the final paper.</comment>Professor Marglin is one of the most outstanding professors I have had at Harvard. The course covered a wide range of topics on modernity and development. I learned a great amount, and it truly expanded my knowledge of the topic. This course will transform the way you think about the modern world and different forms of knowledge.</comment></course>ECON 1430: Macroeconomics and Politics</title>This is a great class to take if you have a solid economics background and want to be in a seminar setting with one of the world's most eminent economists. The material is interesting and relevant. This is an "only at Harvard class".</comment>Take this if you're serious about economics, and about potentially going to grad school down the line. The material is interesting and gives you a deep-dive into real macro theory. Be prepared to self-study a bit to keep up with the material. This class will not hold your hand; it's pretty disorganized, so you have to do what you can to make sure you're learning.</comment>This class is very theoretical and requires a fairly strong math background in order to understand everything. Basically all we did was learn about different models. The course was very disorganized and the support provided for this class was limited.</comment></course>PHYSICS 15a: Introductory Mechanics and Relativity</title>This course is billed as a normal introductory physics course for people interested in concentrating in physics, chemistry or another science. Supposedly, if you've taken calculus and a little bit of physics in high school you'll be prepared. I had done these things (2 years of physics, 1 and a half of calculus) and felt totally unprepared. It got better over the semester, but every pset was a huge struggle. I had to learn how to think about physics and solving physics problems in a whole new way. Psets usually took me between 6 and 16 hours a week. I highly advise working in groups. Also redo the pests before exams and do lots of practice tests. I should also mention that I had this experience when Dr. Morin was teaching 15a and he's supposedly the best teacher in the physics department.</comment>Although the material can be quite challenging, the resources at your disposal are endless. You will have to struggle through some problem sets, but if you work through them with other students or by looking through lecture materials, you can eventually get to an answer.</comment>Difficult for sure but Professor Morin makes it worth it and you learn A LOT by the end of the semester</comment>An excellent intro course to mechanics and relativity. I took this to fulfill the physics pre-med requirement because it is so much more fulfilling and interesting than PS2. I had never taken physics before and wish I had taken this course as a freshman, so even if you are thinking about possibly concentrating in physics or have even taken physics, shop the course and see if it interests you!</comment>This is a difficult class.</comment>Take this course when Morin is teaching it. The psets require a good deal of time, but if you start a few days beforehand then you will never need to stay up ridiculously late working on them.</comment>Your enjoyment of the course really depends on who you are. This is a very extremely difficult course and struggling through the psets is not always that exciting, but if you have a good study group/friends in the course (I made a lot of friends by taking it!) you'll get through it together and feel accomplished afterwards.</comment>Morin is a great professor, and physics night at Leverett is a wonderful time!</comment>It's a great course and professor Morin is a great lecturer.</comment>Don't expect this class to be a walk in the park. You'll probably have to start the pSets at least 6 days in advance if you don't want to be panicking at Physics Night at Levrett every Wednesday.</comment>It is an amazing class when taken with Morin. He is very good at lectures, there are plenty of examples, he is very organized and so are his notes. The staff is great, so helpful, you make awesome friends over the pset and get through each one so not incredibly stressful. Exams are fine if you study the homework. Overall, its a hard class but you learn a lot and are helped a lot during the process.</comment>This course provides an interesting education in mechanics, although it is perhaps the best fit for those whose concentrations require it.</comment>It's a very challenging class if you lack a physics background, but it is very interesting.</comment>Very difficult and theoretical, but a good introduction to physics and mechanics.</comment>It is best taken as a second, more in-depth exposure to mechanics.</comment>Only take this class if you have your heart set on being a physics concentrator. Even then, it might change your mind. If you simply want to try out physics, take an easier class.</comment>It's certainly not easy, especially in regards to exams, but it's definitely worthwhile.  You'll probably have to take it if you have any interest in learning physics.  Those of you who want to devote your whole lives to this type of class can go take Physics 16, but if not, this is the class for you, since here you'll learn actual physics (sorry AP50 & PS2/3) at a rigorous level (sorry PS12).  The problem sets are challenging, but you have great resource in the form of office hours, where you can literally sit in Morin's office for hours just working on the problem set and asking him any questions, as well as Physics Night, where you have access to not just Morin but also each other, and my god the problem sets are so much better when you're working in groups, can't stress this enough.  Morin is also fantastic, although at times I would find myself overwhelmed I could always find solace in going to his office hours and having him explain a concept, which he was always willing to do however many times it took for me to get it just right.  Overall, be ready for a challenge, but a worthwhile one.</comment>If you haven't taken mechanics before, this class will be hell unless you are a math genius. This class will ruin your life if you aren't gaga for physics.</comment>Great physics class, you learn a lot but at a fast pace. Take if you are comfortable with physics.</comment>This class is very challenging, but you won't regret taking it because you learn a lot and it's very rewarding.</comment>Professor Morin is a phenomenal lecturer, and is very accessible outside of class. The problem sets can be difficult, but doing them at Wednesday Physics Nights in Leverett are a great way of "bonding by fire" with other physics students. The course is very well organized, and the demos during lecture are fantastic.</comment>Morin is an effective lecturer; class material takes time to digest and do psets, so be ready for a good amount of work. It is a fair class but pretty high expectations</comment>So the big question is: should I take Physics 16 or Physics 15a. If you would consider yourself a physics "enthusiast," then take 16. It will expose you to many abstract concepts that you may not encounter for a while. But if you love doing physics, then I would go with 15a. It is framed to help you, above all, understand physics. This does not mean by any means that it is easy; it may require some extra textbook reading. But the psets are manageable and collaboration actually enhances your performance, rather than just being desperate to get them done. To do well in the course, start out well; if you start with the right momentum, you will be prepared to do well throughout the course.</comment>Great course. If you're considering doing 16, definitely start there and then drop down if you need to. Reading the lecture notes in advance probably helps a lot, but is not necessary.</comment>It will be rough, but you will get through it if you have friends to do psets with. You will also learn an incredible amount of physics and feel super smart.</comment>The course is fun and the professor is amazing. But be prepared to spend a good amount of time on psets.</comment>It's a good course, and well taught, but it is difficult. You'll have to spend a pretty good amount of time on it, especially without any physics background.</comment>This class is difficult but you leave with an expansive knowledge of mechanics. This is a great course to learn mechanics if you are willing to put in the time.</comment>If you have a required physics course and took AP Physics C: Mechanics in high school, Physics 15a with Dr. Morin is a great choice. It was a better fit for me than Physics 16 (from which I switched into 15a).</comment>Be aware that you're going to have to put in a lot of work! It's an intense class, perhaps not as bad as 16, but still requires a good amount of work.</comment>You will definitely learn a lot about physics, but you have to put in the time yourself. The problem sets alone are probably not enough preparation for the exams so it's good to do extra problems out of the book as a supplement.</comment>This class does an amazing job teaching all the concepts within the syllabus.</comment>Dr. Morin is a good lecturer who sets up some great physics demos.  The material very interesting for the most, and even with a strong background in high school physics, one learns a lot. I'd definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in physics.</comment>(Disclaimer: I am a potential Physics concentrator) Professor Morin is very accessible and a good lecturer.  The demos are cool.  P-Sets can be difficult, but are usually solvable without too much headache.  Section can be good or bad depending on your TF.  Lab assignments are fairly easy.   Do the P-Set over the weekend (Assigned Thursday, due next Thursday), instead of during the week.  It not worth putting it off.</comment>Very good course with interesting and exciting material. The lab section is wide open so you need good self drive to engage in lab. The material is incredibly difficult. Be prepared to spend a lot of time on P-sets and studying for tests. Take a light schedule with this course!</comment>Don't take it. Stick to 12a or PS2</comment>It's not for the faint of heart.</comment>This course is designed for potential physics concentrators. Do not take if you are not planning on studying higher level physics.</comment>The tragedy of introductory physics at this school is that there is no way to simultaneously achieve the goals of 1) taking an interesting introductory mechanics course and 2) actually sleeping seven nights a week. 15a exhibits precisely the features that make big introductory science lectures infamously soul-sucking. You get what you signed up for: conceptually tame, challengingly nitpicky material and assignments and oddly difficult exams. PSI shouldn't really factor into your considerations; it's a really relaxed intro to basic data analysis techniques, and you pretty much just have to show up once a week and play with things. David Morin is the bright spot in this dull picture because he's super devoted, accessible, and kind, but even he did not manage to shake the paradigm of introductory science classes that almost seem designed to turn away creative students. I really recommend against taking this course if your primary motivation for taking physics is to get a picture of what physics as a discipline tells us about the world - this is a course about learning tools to apply to pset problems.</comment>This class is physics for physics' sake. It covers a good deal of material and applications are lacking, but if that's what interests you, take the course. It's bit of a challenge, but a reasonable one. You make good friends at physics night, and you walk away with a strong understanding of mechanics.</comment>This class might look intimidating, but it's really a fantastic course. You'll learn so much about physics and how physicists think. Especially take this class if it is taught by Professor Morin! He is by far the best.</comment>Professor Morin was amazing. He explained topics with so much clarity that even though the material was difficult, I never felt overwhelmed. Tests were also very fair. If Professor Morin teaches it again, take this class!</comment>I love mechanics and the way it gets you to think. This course forces you to get a great understanding for basic mechanics.</comment>This class really helps develop a very good understanding of a wide variety of 2D mechanics and 1D relativity problems.</comment>Physics 15a, especially with Morin, is exceptional. Lectures are very informative, and the in-class examples and demos really help with learning concepts and gaining an intuition for the subject material.

If you are choosing between this class and a class like 12a, I would say go ahead and take this class. It will probably be more work, but if you go in with the right attitude you will enjoy every minute of it.</comment>Its bloody hard.</comment>Be ready: this course will be very difficult. If you are a freshman taking this course "instead of 16", you will be challenged.</comment>If you choose to take this class, just know that you are going to have to put a lot of time into it. This class is not impossible if you give yourself enough time to do everything, but I think doing things with not enough time is what makes this class hard.</comment>If you are not truly invested in learning the material and are not overly interested in physics this course probably is not for you. However it is a really well taught course and a majority of the teaching staff really wants to see you learn and understand the material. They are passionate about the material and they try their best to make it interesting with really cool demos. One of my favorite things about the staff was how open they were to discussing topics in physics even if they were beyond or below the course - not in class but during office hours or in emails.</comment>Very insightful. Useful even if you have taken AP-level physics.</comment>Absolutely take this class if you want to learn a TON about physics and to learn how to think in a new, different way. Professor Morin is an amazing lecturer, and the material is difficult but digestible if you work hard. The course also teaches a new method to problem solving that I had never learned before; I think I am a better scientist as a result of it.</comment>Please try to have a strong foundation of physics before going into the course, as it will only help.</comment>Such a great class! Best intro class I have taken (among many) at Harvard. Phenomenal teaching staff, really interesting problem sets, helpful section, and a well-integrated lab component. Take it even if physics scares you a bit!</comment>I'd recommend Physics 15a to any aspiring physics student. The instruction is top notch and the content is engaging. Try your best to enjoy physics night.</comment>Be prepared to put in the work. Morin is a great professor so try and take it with him. Other than that, just a lot of material to cover but it is rewarding.</comment></course>ITAL 30: Upper-Level Italian: Italian Through Art</title>It's great! If you like art, and Italian, and having fun discussions during class—which should be everyone—then this course is great.</comment>This course is a great balance of grammar review, reading short pieces of literature, and creative activities. I really enjoyed the final project, which was to record an audioguide in Italian for several works of art in the Harvard Art Museums. The professor was also excellent.</comment></course>PHYSCI 12b: Electromagnetism and Statistical Physics from an Analytic, Numerical and Experimental Perspective</title>MATLAB is difficult but a great tool to learn</comment>My biggest takeaway is being able to use MATLAB. This course is very time consuming. Don't have anything else scheduled on Wednesday nights. I wouldn't recommend taking math simultaneously. I wouldn't take this class unless it's a requirement.</comment>Best way to meet the physics requirement, HANDS DOWN. The 15 series is more geared toward physics concentrators who really want a heavy theoretical challenge, while the PS 2/3 series is too rife with pre-meds (and this is a pre-med writing this). Sure, there is a significant MATLAB component to this class, but this is a programming language WELL WORTH KNOWING, and you can't beat take-home exams.</comment>useful to learn MATLAB quickly, but is overwhelming for new, unexperienced coders</comment>I am a chemistry concentrator, and the ps12a/b track was by far the best option for physics. I liked 12a better, but I still learned a lot about electricity and magnetism is a very low-stress way. Psets aren't too bad, and the system with module quizzes is really great and takes away a lot of the stress. Not necessarily the best taught class, but the teaching staff is also very willing to help and very accessible outside of class. Overall, a very low-stress, interesting, and engaging way to fulfill a physics requirement. Nils and Joon are particularly fantastic!!</comment>nothing</comment>good class, best option in intro physics</comment>Good physics for engineers</comment>I took this class after taking AP50a and realizing literally any experience could be better than that.  That said, physics 12b was really not bad.  The lectures are pretty dense and equation-derivation heavy, and most of the homeworks leave you questioning yourself after a first attempt--but physics night is crucial, as are other office hours and section.  The module quizzes (take home, weeklong, open material, partner-only assessments) were an interesting way of evaluating, and typically they tried to pair people with matlab experience to those without, but it often became the case that one person got totally shafted by their partner assignment. The final project was actually quite fun and I feel like I learned more from that than from any lecture in the course.</comment>I really enjoyed this class. The professor and teaching staff are really dedicated and impressive. The psets are very interesting, and the module quizes are quite reasonable.</comment>If you want to take physics, but you don't want to take physics 15 or 16, this is a good course for you. If you're fairly good at physics and you want to learn CS, or vice versa, this is a good course for you. If you want an easy gen ed, this is not a good course for you.</comment>While this is undoubtedly easier than Physics 15, the lack of communication in the class and the Matlab component still makes it difficult.</comment>Very good class, with great teaching staff. But it requires a lot more MATLAB than I thought.</comment>This course has a good deal of numerical applications pertinent to engineering and the life sciences. The focus is more on the practical aspects of physics. The professor cares and makes time to meet with students--please do go to his office hours.</comment>Great course - really liked the ps12a/b series. I think the numeric component helped me learn concepts; by having to programmatically demonstrate a concept, such as the magnetic field around a solenoid, you'll be better able to grasp what is taught in lecture.</comment>I would tell future students that from what I have heard and experienced, the PS12 series is definitely a good physics track, especially since it provides tangible experience with Matlab.</comment>PS12b is a great way to learn satisfy a physics requirement and learn E&M. If you are a science/math minded person, and like physics (but not in a LOVE physics kind of way), this is a good choice. The teaching staff is supportive and encourages a mix of analytical and numerical (MATLAB) work.</comment>This course was difficult-- lectures could be hard to follow, and the assignments were really challenging. Matlab background is really useful, since it's a big part of the assignments but not covered in lecture.</comment>As far as the PS12 series goes, this is definitely the weaker of the two. Be prepared to put in a fair amount of time into the problem sets; though sometimes the physics required for the homework wasn't necessarily hard, there is a lot of nit-picky Matlab and geometry. Make sure you find a good pset group or take advantage of office hours in order to complete the homework in a timely manner. The Module Quizzes are a godsend though, because it is so much better to have a beefed up take-home midterm than an in-class midterm. Plus you get to work with a partner, so you're less likely to flounder. That being said, PS12b isn't a hard class to BS your way through, though I wouldn't suggest it personally. Everything is group based, so if you can find smart people and don't feel guilty being a leech, you could put in minimal work. 

The lecture component of this course was fairly boring; Professor Kaxiras just derives formulas the whole time. He's a good guy though. The preceptor, Joon, is a little colder and doesn't seem to really be interested in the students. But all of this is made up for by the awesomeness that is Nils, the lab preceptor. He is literally the best.</comment>This is a hard class that will require a lot of outside work. Very theoretical.</comment>This class is a good compromise between AP50 and Physics 15b, in that there are psets but it is not over the top rigorous in the analytical approach. The matlab portion of the course seems daunting, especially if like me you have never used matlab before. That being said, if you have experience coding and go to the matlab bootcamp at the beginning of the semester, you will be fine. Expect to spend a lot of time on the psets for this course, though they are totally do-able if you work with others. Also, PLEASE participate in class. Speak up and ask questions and you will understand the material better. If you do not, then honestly most of the class will be lost along with you and you will have to figure it out on your own. There is some material in this course where you will just have to figure it out on your own. The Section TFs are extremely helpful with this though.</comment>I didn't feel like lectures were as complimentary to the homework assignments, so expect to spend some extra time in office hours to learn the concepts revolving around problem sets.</comment>Not enough support was offered for the matlab portion of the psets (which usually took 40% of the entire pset time).</comment>This course is great. The numerical portion of the course is challenging but really rewarding when you figure out how to solve a problem. Take this class!</comment>This class requires a pretty significant amount of work for the psets and module quizzes, but having no exams is worth it, and the final project is fun.</comment>This class is a good intro to circuits/E&M. The worst part is the partner quizzes. All of my partners were terrible and did 0 work. Lectures are boring, but you don't need to go to them. I took AP Physics C in high school and was able to figure most of the PSets out without additional help.</comment>This class definitely needs some work. Professor Kaxiras and Joon are both extremely passionate and knowledgeable but I really didn't learn much this semester. The psets are heinously difficult and impossible to do without extensive trips to office hours. I have never felt quite the same despair as I did when working on the nearly impossible module quizzes. Hopefully this course will be better in the future, because it has so much potential! The lab component is the saving grace of this course. I wish it were a bigger part.</comment>In order to do well in this course, it will help greatly to have a strong background in physical concepts the class discusses.  Office hours are great if you have time.  Lectures focus on deriving different physical principles.</comment>There's a lot of work. Reading quizzes, lab, problem sets. If you fall behind at first, you'll never catch up. Tony and Nils are super helpful. Professor Kaxiras's lectures are generally not a good use of time.</comment>Lectures are not the best, but Kaxiras' office hours are lifesavers</comment>This course is very good and you will learn a lot about electromagnetism and waves. However, be prepared to struggle with problem sets as the problems are not trivial. Moreover, the material is somewhat difficult, not nearly as difficult as any of the Physics 15/16 series.</comment>This class is a good alternative to all the other physics options (15, AP50, and PS2/3). The take home module quizzes and final project were a lot less stressful than a midterm and final would be. The lab is AWESOME (Nils is the best!), section was helpful, and all the TFs were really nice. I probably learned more from the textbook than from lecture, partially because I would read to prepare for the reading quizzes, but the textbook was good so that was fine with me. Also I took this before taking 12a and I was fine.</comment>Go to class and read before class, because it will make understanding much easier and you will learn more quickly. Professor Kaxiras' office hours are priceless and you can get a lot of help there, while also making friends with people in the course.</comment>Be prepared to do a LOT of MATLAB and have no training/teaching about MATLAB done in the class.  Good lectures, though, and very committed teaching staff.</comment>Difficulty: 4/5. A lot of MATLAB, good for engineers</comment>The format of the course is stellar - the homeworks are tough but reasonable. The lab component is also great - very hands on and super easy. You should have some prior experience with matlab or  coding - the course is very matlab heavy.</comment>This class is a more practical, as opposed to theoretical, approach to physics. The focus is really on application of physical concepts, which makes it a great class for engineers. The class is also extremely collaborative. If you don't like working with a partner or a group, it is not for you. Every exam is a partner take-home, and there is a group final project. This is also a great class to take if you enjoy programming or want to improve your MATLAB skills, as there is a very large MATLAB component.</comment>This could have been a stronger class with the old TF. The teaching staff did not seem as cohesive this time around, though the TFs were always willing to help out. My primary complaint has to be with the vagueness of the assignments and the frequent irrelevance of the lectures, as the only way to do the homework ended up being asking for clarification again and again from the TFs. Professors and TFs didn't even agree on how to approach things, and while they were well-intentioned and accommodating, it was kind of stressful. If you have the time, I think you do learn a lot from the class and can guarantee you do well since all exams are take home and let you spend a lot of time learning and perfecting your answers. Make sure you know MATLAB and you should do okay!</comment>It's taught very well and has far less Matlab than many of its counterparts and equivalent courses.</comment>Go to office hours as often as you can. Come with questions prepared.</comment>prior experience with physics helps so much.</comment>Tests are take home, but the course is poorly organized.</comment>It's a very good physics class and I enjoyed the Matlab components a lot, but it's definitely more proof-heavy than PS12a was... Very interesting material, but not always helpful for doing the homework.</comment></course>FRENCH 70a: Introduction to French Literature I: From the Middle Ages to Eighteenth Century</title>If you love French literature, there is no better person to learn from than Tom Conley. Even if you don't love French literature, his kindness and excitement make the class a lot of fun. Definitely take a 60 level class first, though. I jumped a few levels and found the class pretty difficult.</comment>Be ready for not really knowing what's required, but it's minimal. also Conley loves looking at maps..</comment>This class is an excellent introduction to French literature from the Middle Ages to the 17th century. You have the wonderful opportunity to read, explore, and analyze many diverse texts and writers. It is a course that is greatly illuminating of French culture and literature.</comment>French 70a is a wonderful class. I loved all the readings we had, but it's really important that you feel passionate about French literature. It is really fun to write in French, despite the difficulty. The flexibility in the course is so refreshing in comparison to strict syllabus classes. I love Professor Conley and his passion for the literature we read. You should try doing most of the readings, even though it's not necessary.</comment>You can get away with not doing the readings, but it's so much more rewarding to actually do them!</comment>French 70a presents a fantastic and comprehensive survey of early French Literature from the rise of the Medieval canon with La Chanson de Roland to the fall of the Ancien Régime in 1789, though what era you end with may vary depending on time considerations. Although there are a few minor organization quirks (the syllabus is difficult to decipher and isn't completely adhered to, what each assignment will entail and what each lecture will cover can be confusing, etc.), the course, on balance, is well taught. The lectures, all presented via powerpoints, are engaging—Professor Conley often acts out dramatic scenes from the texts—and the sections, which allow for more intimate discussion and close-reading of specific passages, provide critical balance necessary to any literature course taught in this manner. 

Professor Conley also integrates his extra-literary interests, for example, cartography—and led a special session at the Pusey Library. He and Grégoire are very accessible—it's easy to meet with him almost any day in Kirkland, where he is one of the House Masters, and he is willing to work individually with students on specific assignments. In terms of workload and grading, this past year the graded assignments comprised only two short papers and an optional creative final piece, which differs from what was outlined in the syllabus. The weekly assignments simply involve reading the texts. 

On balance, this is a fantastic introductory French literature course—regardless of whether you wish to pursue this field as a concentration. Assignments and grading are on the lighter side, so if you have any interest in French literature, I recommend this course. Because of the nature of the course structure, however, what you get out of the class depends heavily on what you put in (whether you complete the readings and engage in section and lecture), and although you can conceivably earn decent grades without putting in much effort, you would be doing yourself and the instructors a disservice. Therefore, take this course if you truly want to learn about French literature and are willing to put in a very reasonable amount of effort.</comment>This class is a great introduction to French Literature, but the readings at times can take a while to fully understand. It's important to weigh your French background and the time that could be required to understand the texts. That said, the readings are all very interesting and make you really feel like you've explored several important texts.</comment>This class was one of the most frustrating classes I have been in at Harvard.  Although it was a small class, students rarely had the opportunity to speak.  Professor Conley, although clearly extremely knowledgable, tended to get off track, and went on tangents that only confused us.  The literature was extremely difficult to understand because of the fact that it is all written in Old French.  The assignments were unclear (for example, our 2nd paper had 20 prompts to choose from, and our final paper involves creating a dialogue between authors we have read, but there is no page limit).  Unless you are very, very, interested in the subject, I would not recommend this class.  Be aware that it is a literature class, not a French language class.</comment>This course is very disorganized and a poor introduction to French literature.  Only in section are you able to really engage with what the authors and texts are saying.  Class felt like a waste of time - often went through history/author biographies/geography/etc. and very little time was spent understanding the actual texts themselves.</comment>This is a good way to get an introduction early French Lit.  The writing assignments are manageable, and the reading load is quite enormous, but is faily skimmable.  Prof. Conley is a GEM.  He's clearly incredibly passionate about the subject and just sitting in lecture is incredibly pleasant.</comment>The readings are linguistically difficult but manageable. Professor Conley is an engaging lecturer, even though he goes off tangents a bit too often. Grégoire is a great section leader.</comment>If your high school's french department was weak and you have little practice writing academic papers in french, as I did, you may struggle initially with the written assignments. That said, the workload is pretty manageable (though readings are difficult if the vocabulary is unfamiliar) and the comments for improvements of your work are very helpful. The Romance Language Department offers tutoring as well, which you should definitely take advantage of if you feel you would benefit from it.</comment>I didn't enjoy the course for several reasons. First of all, while Professor Conley is very very knowledgeable about the material, he oftentimes (to often) goes on tangents that leave me confused and then make me forget about what we were talking about. I tried to put so much effort into this class for the first month, and I thought I was getting something out of it, but as the classes went on, i started liking it less and less. Conley would often start making off-topic jokes or sometimes act out parts of the text in a way that I felt didn't contribute to my understanding. The class was extremely disorganized, what with having two conflicting syllabuses on the isite, then instead deciding to post the homework on the isite, which left you with no record of what previous homeworks. I felt really disappointed in this class, because I was really looking forward to developing my understand of french literature, but found myself only knowing names, not material. I wish this class had taken itself a bit more seriously, because then I would have too.</comment>If you have even the vaguest interest in the history of French literature, the French language, or just reading good books in a low-pressure yet thoroughly edifying environment, you should take this class. The readings are carefully selected with the intention of showcasing the moral, intellectual, and social currents that shaped some of France's greatest literature and providing a broad overview of its evolution. Tom Conley is an excellent person, a great teacher, an incorrigible jokester, and, above all, a scholar. Beyond the reading, he and his personality make the class what it is. Gregoire Menu is one of the most committed TFs I've had; his sections were thought-provoking and indispensable.</comment>This course is what you make of it. It has the potential to expose you to the greatest hits of French literature. If you do all the readings and go to office hours and pay attention in class, you will have one experience. If you do half the readings and zone out during lectures, you will have another experience. Either way, this class is not super stressful and Conley is fun. Gregoire is an awesome TF.</comment></course>EXPOS 20.234: Who Owns the Past?</title>This class is a manageable Expos class, but it is by no means easy. Be prepared for long, dense readings but some interesting class discussions. You could get away with not doing the readings but that will be a serious impediment to succeeding in writing your papers.</comment>This is a great expos class - it is fascinating, chill, and has great discussions. Do yourself a favor and reading the readings so that you get something out of the class. Go to office hours just for the sake of chatting with Janling about his travels.</comment>Who Owns the Past is a course full of interesting topics-- many of which may be unfamiliar to most students, but I think that made the class more enjoyable and eye-opening. One important thing to note is that the class is not just about archaeology- it's also about justice, human rights, and other very broad and fascinating concepts. The draft workshops and revision process really allowed me to think hard about my writing and my writing alone, in a way English classes simply did not do before. I would recommend this class!</comment>This class was definitely an experience with a lot of lively discussion. If you take this class, there will be many opportunities for you to develop many deep ideas with your peers in a constructive manner.</comment>It's not that much work. Janling is a great dude. I'm not sure how much my writing improved. This is probably because I spent most of my time working on other courses.</comment>Great preceptor and very interesting</comment>Even if you don't have any interest in archaeology, this is a great class to take. Broader ideas about academia, history, culture, government, etc. are effectively incorporated into the course, and with the open-ended final research paper, you can take the class into whatever direction you'd like. Janling is a great preceptor and is always there for individual support. Overall, the class has been effective in improving my writing.</comment>This is a great class.  The essays are fairly simple, although they involve a little bit of thinking and time.  There are no response papers, so its up to you to do the readings, which are important if you want to write a good essay.  In the end, it's not that difficult, and fun.  Janling was a great preceptor.</comment>This class is very fun.  Janling is one of the best preceptors out there and, compared to other expos courses, there is relatively little work.</comment>This course has a great professor. The workload is manageable, and most of the course is fairly interesting.</comment>Very low work load and interesting content for essays.</comment>This class is a legend and a half.</comment>Janling is a wonderful preceptor who provides brilliant feedback on assignments.</comment></course>EXPOS 20.266: Society and the Witch</title>The anthropological readings were extremely interesting, but unfortunately they only comprise about half of the class material. The required reading (which I assume is required for all Expos) is somewhat dry, and other than that, you also watch Harry Potter and Bewitched. Take this class if you have interest in writing and discussing Harry Potter or Bewitched, do not expect an in-depth analysis of how magic is constructed in societies unless you are willing to put in time and work for your own research project. Overall, the preceptor is very fun and the subject has potential to be academically interesting--you have a lot of freedom for the research paper, so everything depends on what you want out of the class.</comment>It is a lot of work initially (front-loaded) but this is actually a good thing because you have so long for the final essay.</comment>I would recommend Society and the Witch to anybody. Based on what Ive learned talking to students in other Expos sections, Society and the Witch is by far the best course to take. It was genuinely interesting, and Dr. Martin provides excellent feedback for every step of the writing process. My only objections to this class stem from the fact that I don't really like writing papers.</comment>This is probably the coolest EXPOS out there. The topic is interesting, the professor is great, and the materials are fun.</comment>This course, although it does not focus on the witches of fantasy genres as much as it seems to, provides an overview of the actual figure of the witch in society, both modern and in fantasy. Do not expect to talk about the kind of magic of Harry Potter all the time, but still, get excited to watch a Harry Potter movie and an episode of Bewitched as an assignment! Ricky is very knowledgeable with anthropology and will show you a very different aspect of the witch. Just make sure to take advantage of the accessibility of Ricky's feedback and make sure to clarify the prompt for each assignment and know what's due next class!</comment>This class was fun to be a part of, but like any Expos class (I would imagine) you have to be interested in the material.  We read Harry Potter and watched Bewitched, so the content was easy to wrap my mind around, though for other people, it might have been less interesting to be writing papers about.</comment>This is the BEST expos! Dr. Martin is a great professor, and it's so hard to go wrong with a class that focuses on Harry Potter and Bewitched as primary sources- if you're a nut for these kinds of works, take this class! You'll walk away with a new perspective.</comment>This is a great section of Expos! Ricky is a great preceptor and very enthusiastic. He always provides thoughtful and very helpful comments on your work. You will get to read a number of interesting works on anthropology. The second essay is fun because you can apply this anthropology to either Harry Potter or Bewitched. Ricky designed the schedule of our section very well, so we had more time to work on our final project than other sections. If you are at all interested in anthropology or simply like witches/wizards, this is a great expos for you!</comment>The classes and discussions are fun and enjoyable but it take a lot of work to reach the level of writing that is expected of you.</comment>Fun course to take for Expos. Richard Martin is a very enthusiastic teacher and makes class quite exciting.</comment>It's a very interesting class with a passionate professor.</comment></course>E-PSCI 109: Earth Resources and the Environment</title>This class was amazing because the content is so practical and "real-world". The syllabus covers fossil fuel extraction, renewable energies, mineral extraction, etc. Be proactive in asking prof. Shaw questions - he really is a wealth of knowledge. John Shaw talks quickly, so find a good way to take notes! Find a lab buddy if you are not confident.</comment>A great way to learn about serious issues</comment>A lot of fun. Field trips are awesome. Professor Shaw is really engaging. Very manageable workload. Take it!</comment>This class is almost exclusively fact-memorization. This makes for relatively easy exams if you study for them. Everything on the lecture slides will be tested. If you'd like to learn about how to prospect for oil and mine for coal, definitely take this course. If you're interested in renewables, you'll learn a little bit, but the teaching staff has very clear interests and the environment isn't one of them.</comment>The best class at Harvard in my opinion. While the material is hard and there is a lot of it, you learn about everything you've ever wanted to know about energy, both renewable and fossil fuels-based, in great detail. The labs can be tedious and long, but they do give you a fuller understanding of the topics from a practical perspective. If you don't have any background in geology, make sure to read a little about petroleum geology before taking the class, and you will do fine.</comment>Labs can be tedious. Field trips are cool, but it is hard to fit into your schedule. Lectures can be boring at times, but final will quiz you on random details from lecture that are not in the lecture slides. You will learn a lot about all of our energy resources, but mineral resources are discusses until the last week. This class does not have a lot of hard geology, but it is very interesting and will make you more informed about our energy future. I'd take it again</comment>Class is very informative, but the labs are a pain.</comment>You will learn a ton from this class but it's not easy to get a good grade and be prepared to put a ton of time into it.</comment>It's a difficult class, but a very rewarding one overall.</comment>Take this class if you want to to anything with energy after college. Aside from another one of Prof. Shaw's classes I believe this is the only one that really engages with the subject and I learned so much from it. But also be prepared to spend some time in labs.</comment>The material of this class is interesting, but lectures are pointless and labs are irrelevant and difficult</comment>This is a great class. Makes you really think about turning on the lights and using materials. Highly recommend.  Well taught class about applicable interesting material.  Well organized and fast paced.  Makes you a better informed citizen on energy policy issues. Taught with minimal bias.</comment>This course gives a strong foundation for understanding and evaluating the way people produce energy and the many resource options we have in doing so.</comment>If you're truly interested in the subject of this class its absolutely awesome. Lectures are inherently interesting for you, labs are cool (even if time consuming), and field trips are unique and exciting experiences. you won't have many other chances to tour a gas drilling rig! One of my favorite classes at Harvard, and it's a pretty light workload too. If you don't like energy or earth resources, your experience would probably not be as positive.</comment>EPS 109 is a great and informative course with a superb Professor (Shaw). The only thing to be aware of is the extensively time consuming labs that this course has. One of the labs had me spending upwards of 12 hours on it. Other than that the field trips are worthwhile and educational.</comment>This course was very, very good. I highly recommend that every EPSer take it. It seriously is a MUST. You learn a great deal at a very manageable level, and the field trips are amazing. Also, Shaw is THE man!</comment>Essentially a crash course on how energy is produced. You learn about all aspects of energy-- oil/gas, renewables, environmental impacts-- and overall I'm so glad I took this class. That said, it was painful at times; labs were unnecessarily time-consuming and long. You cover an insane amount of material, so definitely not an easy A (or an easy B!) but absolutely worth taking if you're interested in energy, no matter your academic background.  The field trip was fun and relevant, but does fall during reading period (you've been warned).</comment>Take this class! It is so interesting and relevant. I feel like I left with a broad range of knowledge on cutting-edge issues.</comment>This course really taught me a working knowledge of the various forms of energy and their relative benefits and environmental impacts.  It's a must-take if you want to be know where energy comes from and what are options are going forward.  As a junior finishing the fall, this may very well be the best class I've taken at Harvard.</comment>Absolutely loved this class. The labs and field-trips take time but are entirely worth it.</comment>It was a good class overall! The material was relevant and I definitely learned a ton. Both Prof. Shaw and Joe were good lecturers and the teaching staff was very accessible. I'd definitely recommend this class.

One main reservation: be prepared for the labs to take up to double the time allotted. Not every lab was as bad (and some can pretty easily be completed during section times) but others require lots of work outside of class. The five no-penalty late days on labs will be your friends.

On the field trips: the day-long field trips were both really cool (especially the trip to the nuclear plant). The longer field trip was also really great (especially the shale gas rig!!), but if you're taking this course in the winter, BE PREPARED. I physically didn't own enough layers to keep myself warm enough on the trip. If ever in the future this course goes back to being offered in the spring, TAKE IT IN THE SPRING.</comment></course>SCI-PHYUNV 29: The Climate-Energy Challenge</title>Loved this course! I was already interested in Climate Change, and this class was wonderfully structured to help me understand the issue from a scientific and solution-oriented perspective</comment>Take it! Get started early on the final. And seek out help. The TFs want to support you and will do it super effectively (especially Lauren and Tom, at least in my experience). Super interesting material. Everyone on the teaching staff was clearly trying to be very mindful and deliberate about how the class was taught. It was hard to grasp what was a big deal and what was super small. Also 3 hours, as much as I wanted to stay focused, was a difficult length of time to remain present and concentrated. I think section could have stood to be longer, and lecture shorter.</comment>This class would be great if it taught the same content with similar assignments, but in a completely different format and maybe with a different professor. The material discussed in class was interesting and informative. However, the three hour lecture format was brutual and unnecessary. Most of the time was wasted, and everyone spent most of the lecture checking email or on their phones. It conveyed a lack of respect for students' time on the part of the teaching staff. Professor Schrag is clearly knowledgeable and passionate about the subject, but often went over the three hour time slot and had a habit of condescendingly interacting with students in class in terms of both completion of assignments, performance, and engaging with the material. I did learn quite a lot from the class as a social science concentrator, but given the other issues, the class was difficult to complete.</comment>The course felt a little disorganized, but am sure will be improved with feedback. Teaching staff seemed really devoted to making it work. The sections is the best part of the course - 3 hour lectures can get difficult and daunting but if you are taking it for the Gen Ed, this probably isn't the hardest class out there.</comment>The final project will take up quite a bit of time. It is something to spread out over the course of at least a week, not one day.</comment>It would be a crime not to take this class when given the chance. It helps you appreciate the seriousness of our dependence on fossil fuels and the effects it will have in the coming century.</comment>Dan Schrag is an absolute legend. Coming into the class, I was somewhat interested in climate change, and this class allowed me to fulfill the SPU gen-ed in a reasonable manner. The beginning half of the course is rather science focused, while the second half, clearly the more interested half, was more focused on developing an energy system. In short, this class is exactly what you want to see out of a gen-ed at Harvard: it is thought-provoking, helps you see the world you live in in a different light, and offers a challenge, at times, but is not overly difficult or time consuming. Teaching staff is very organized and the course is highly focused on making sure the students understand the material. Lecture is great. Dan fields questions for basically three hours, some of which are very interesting. You get a lot out of it, and this could not be more of a relevant topic. Only downside is that there is not great clarity about grading. Midterm average was about 70%, so hopefully some sort of curve is taken into consideration here.</comment>The final paper will push you to an extreme during a stressful time of the year. It's definitely worthwhile though.</comment>As someone who's very interested in climate and energy, taking this class was a no-brainer! Don't be concerned about the semi-flipped format: it actually frees up a lot of time for in-class discussions. Professor Schrag is one of the big names in climate policy today: he has some incredible insight into not only the science behind climate, but the policy and the politics involved in the energy sector. He can jump from topic to topic, which means you've got to be constantly paying attention, but on the whole, lectures are very engaging. The final model and paper is a challenging assignment, but if you put some time into it, you can learn an enormous amount about the challenge of transitioning the US energy system. This class is a must for people who want a solid introduction to climate science and energy policy.</comment>Its good, but always go to office hours, because you will not understand what is required from you by just attending lecture.</comment>This is a course with wonderful material but greatly in need of a structural makeover. The three-hour Monday lectures left much of the class tired and unable to effectively deal with the material, at times to the professor's disappointment. The first half of the class was fine, with an even workload and interesting concepts about the climate, but the second had no assignments and left a monster term paper for the last week of the semester which left most stressed and confused. I hope that in the future, this paper has been spaced out more reasonably as well as the lectures.</comment>I could not have asked for more from my SPU Gen Ed. Professor Schrag is an engaging lecturer, the TF staff is very supportive, and the course material is highly relevant to the world today. You will definitely come out of this class a better informed citizen (and have a newfound appreciation for science!)</comment>Great course to get you acclimated to the current discussion on the climate and energy challenge.</comment>The difficulty is just right, forcing you to engage with the science behind climate change, but not so complex as to walk away more confused. The final report is a useful exercise in putting the challenges into perspective, given all the talk in the news.</comment>Great course to gain a solid background to the carbon emissions problem we face today and the challenges that face us in the future.</comment>Good course and fantastic for an SPU. The videos are awesome and the final project is informative. Some of the lectures can be rather boring and there are parts of the class that are missing structure but overall a worthwhile experience.</comment>This really is a great class. The three hour lectures were tough to get through, but Professor Schrag is incredible engaging, casual, enthusiastic and so so smart. He has a no-bullshit attitude, both about his class and the material. This is honestly one of the most relevant classes I've taken at haravard and the things I learned are so invaluable on a global scale. I can now have a conversation about climate change and actually feel like I know what I'm talking about. Professor Schrag is unbiased, realistic and fair about his views, AND about his grading. The final project may seem daunting but it's very manageable and the overall workload for this class is really not something to fear, but rather very worth it.</comment>This course is awesome for a person who wants to reach a different level of SPU.</comment>Take it take it take it!  This class is one of the those gems at Harvard that has a low workload but also manages to be incredibly interesting and informative.  The final project isn't that hard- its actually a lot of fun because you get to come up with some pretty creative ways to solve the "climate challenge."  Really open ended, so the final essay is really easy to write.</comment>This is a great class to take if you want to understand climate change. You get to actually do some basic quantitative work on how the energy system should look like in 2050 if we are to meet climate goals.</comment>DO NOT take this class. (Unless they re-design it big time)
There is absolutely NO structure to this class. The lecture could start at one place and then meander all the way to somewhere else. There is NO guide or agenda or any way of know what the hell we're gonna talk about and what we're supposed to take away. At least the way we had it this year, the exam came out of nowhere and we were not given any kind of study guide beforehand. 

I had such positive expectation for this class coming in since it sounded interesting, but I was sorely disappointed throughout the semester. Please do not take this class. It will not only waste your time but also ruin whatever interests you had in this field.</comment>I'll first say that this course is definitely worth taking. That said, it is extremely unbalanced. The first half of the course is amazing—one of the best academic experiences I've had at Harvard—but the second half is really disorganized and needs some revamping. This is the first year they've taught it in this format, however, so I'd be willing to bet that they will make some major adjustments in the near future. Shop the class: it's worth a look.</comment>Take it!</comment>Excellent course format; fascinating lectures</comment>This is a very interesting and painless way to fulfil the SPU requirement. There are no problem sets, and the homework is interesting, doable and graded based on participation rather than quality of work. The homework load is very light, but the midterm/final project is pretty difficult. Still worth it though, because the Professor is interesting, engaging, and really cares, and the teaching staff is really engaged and helpful as well. I would recommend this course. I learned a lot about the state of climate change in the US and beyond, which is obviously very relevant and important. Not just a fluffy gened, actually quite interesting.</comment>Excellent course that everyone should take. You will learn so much about the climate and energy systems, and understand the importance of this knowledge in the future. Also, the snacks are great</comment>Be prepared to learn and stay focused during long lectures.</comment>Take it! You won't find a more accessible and enjoyable introduction to our energy system or climate science at Harvard, and this class gives you solid grounding in both. I only wish I'd taken it earlier. Schrag is a wonderful professor who manages to get to know his students, even in a class of 70-80. Minimal workload until the final research paper, in which you redesign the US's energy system (no small task!) but the assignment leaves room for creativity and flexibility, and I had a ton of fun with it. Zero complaints.</comment>More than just fulfilling a SPU requirement, this class actually fulfills the goals of the Gen Ed program: you come away vastly more informed on and a more able participant in discussions regarding climate change.</comment>This course is a mixed bag. The flipped format (watching the lecture videos on your own before class) is awesome. Professor Schrag is an interesting and funny lecturer, and the TFs are great (try to get in Katie's section if you take it!). If you are at all interested in climate change and how we need to mitigate/prepare for it, then you will really enjoy the material and final project. However, I would hesitate to recommend this course as is because of the grading system. I've never had less of an idea of how my grade would turn out than with this course. The midterm was extremely hard, and wasn't curved at all my year, so it destroyed everyone's grade. Instead of curving, they decided to take into account student improvement over the semester. The final project also counts for almost half your grade. This all combines to create massive uncertainty about grade distribution. Definitely check to see what the grading/assignment structure is before you take the course.</comment>This course teaches you invaluable things about climate change and what we will need to do to manage and mitigate its impacts. Professor Schrag is an engaging lecturer with massive knowledge and interesting viewpoints on the topic. This is a class that everyone should take.</comment>It's a transforming and useful SPU, not just an easy gen ed!</comment>AWESOME class! Dan and section leaders are superb, knowledgable teachers. You also learn a ton about the history that informs the future of physical climate change, as well as the present political environment regarding climate change and energy sources.</comment>Dan Schrag is cocky and is very quick to shut you down if you're wrong, but you can't even hate him for it because he actually knows everything about the climate and all the technologies, theories, and problems that may impact it. This is a great class for learning about those and being able to talk in an informed matter about climate change. It covers subject matter that is important, culturally and politically relevant, and interesting. The TFs are really helpful and the workload (other than the final paper, which requires research) is so extremely minimal and all based on completion. Lecture is three hours long, but it's only once a week and there are breaks halfway through for snack time. If you have to take an SPU GenEd, take this one!</comment>It's a good learning experience. There is little guidance available for the final project, and not much transparency about that, but the first half of the class is an excellent learning experience. The project is also fun, if a bit unnecessarily confusing and stressful.</comment>This course is a terrific way to fulfill a general education requirement while learning about a pressing political issue.</comment></course>TURKISH A: Elementary Modern Turkish</title>My experience in this class is not typical, as I have prior language experience that has helped me a lot. That said, I've really enjoyed studying Turkish this semester, and I think the instruction has been adequate.</comment>Eda and Akif are simply excellent instructors and very kind and understanding people, who will patiently work with you until you feel comfortable with new grammatical forms and vocabulary. This is essential for learning a language. It was a pleasure learning under them, and I look forward to their future instruction.</comment>A solid introduction to Turkish.</comment></course>LITER 148: Crisis: Twentieth-Century European Novels</title>The books were all very fun to read; you'll be reading a great selection of seminal authors. The course meetings were enjoyable--you just need to be prepared to participate. A lot of how the course goes depends on your own involvement, though, because of the professor's obvious love for the books you'll be discussing, it'll be easy to feel involved.</comment>Existence aims for crisis from birth onwards: for further instructions, take this class.</comment>Class discussions will focus primarily on literary styles and techniques. For a class about the social implications of pieces of fiction, I would recommend looking into the History and Literature department.</comment>The works covered in this class are spectacular. Since the focus of the class is the discussion section, it will of course vary from year to year. Based on my experience, I would recommend this course to anybody, even non-concentrators.</comment></course>SPANSH 40: Advanced Spanish Language II: Viewing the Hispanic World</title>This class is a film course. I did not know this going into it. There is a film that has to be watched every single week.</comment>This wasn't my absolute favorite spanish class - I think I liked Spanish 30 a bit better, but that's only because I enjoy reading spanish literature more so than watching spanish movies. With that said, I did greatly enjoy this class. As someone who predominately fills her schedule with hard science classes, I found this one to be a lot of fun, as well as very informative about spanish culture/history in the Franco and post-Franco era. I also feel sufficiently more knowledgeable and cultured after having watched such a diversity of movies. They're not all "great" in the general sense of the word, but there are many gems and they all have something to offer in the way of learning the language and culture.</comment>This class is fun because all you do is watch movies and then talk about them. The workload is manageable.</comment>Johanna is a great teacher, and the classroom environment was comfortable and fun. I always enjoyed class, and the films themselves are often fantastic. There is a good deal of week-to-week work, but it was quite reasonable.</comment>This class is more or less what it sells itself to be. If you like discussing movies and have an OK grasp of Spanish, you will be fine and enjoy the course. They don't do as well a job at teaching you grammar as 30 though (since they assume you know it) so make sure you are able to teach yourself. Also, the selection of movies can be triggering so make sure you are ready to watch movies about some heavy themes. As a survivor of sexual assault and someone that lost a parent growing up, I wish I had known ahead of time that recurrent themes included death of a parent, suicide, rape, and incest (I'd still have taken the course in retrospect though because it makes you think critically). Also I learned a lot about Spain which was great. Overall the course was a lot of fun, pretty chill, and I'd recommend it if you like Spanish and want to practice and improve. Take this class!</comment>This is a great class to practice Spanish and learn culture through film.</comment>This is an EXCELLENT course! Coming from high school Spanish, I wasn't sure what to expect from a college Spanish course. This course improved my abilities while also making me feel much more comfortable conversing and writing in the language. Especially with the instruction of Johanna, I am planning on skipping a couple levels, simply because this course was so effective. The movies are also really fantastic! I enjoyed almost every single one of them. If you're deciding between 40 and 50, this course will definitely make you feel very comfortable. Also, the courses are similar so you could probably skip 50 if you plan on continuing with your studies. Discussion in this class doesn't feel difficult or like going to class! It just feels like you're talking about movies, even though you're improving your Spanish in the process</comment>This class is pretty good. A majority of the movies are interesting, however it is graded more harshly than any previous Spanish course you've taken at Harvard. Be prepared for you first B on a composition.</comment>It is a very rewarding class, but you have to participate and put in the effort if you want to get a lot out of it. If you don't like talking or performing, this class is not a good fit. However, I really enjoyed it and I think it is a great way to polish your speaking abilities and learn a lot about Spanish cinema and history.</comment>Johanna was fantastic and created a very open classroom where you felt free to talk without judgement on your ability to speak or ideas about the movies.</comment>You'll learn a lot of spanish and improve your general culture along the way!</comment>Great way to get to know the language without feeling too much pressure on grades.</comment>The films are mostly enjoyable, and the classwork is not too demanding. The class is speaking-intensive. The experience is determined entirely by your teacher.</comment>This class requires you to watch a movie each week, but you really only need to understand the premise of the movie, so don't freak out if you don't catch each word. The only things that are graded (at least in Johanna's section) are essays and tests, not worksheets, which she never collects. Definitely take Johanna's section. She is hilarious, smart, and easy.</comment>I liked this course a lot, but I already knew a lot about the history of Spain. That said, it is a perfect class to learn about spanish cinema and understand the culture of spain and other countries like Cuba. Also, if you're interested in taking Spanish 59, which is an amazing course, you've got to take this first!</comment>Spanish 40 is an amazing class - you definitely have to take it, especially if you get Dr. Liander as your section leader! The movies are all pretty interesting and it's fun to learn how to speak spanish by discussing them in class! The tests are pretty straightforward and the difficulty of this class is very fair.</comment>Johanna is the best!!!!!!!!!! definitely take this course, you learn so much and it was something i looked forward to every week</comment>Johanna was awesome!  She is really fun to talk with, and really has a passion for languages in general.  Between the movies/class discussion, your Spanish (both spoken/listening) most definitely can improve over the semester in this course!</comment>As far as language classes go, this is a pretty fun one. How much you get out of it will be directly proportional to how good your Spanish is entering it though.</comment>Even though the class is film heavy, do not neglect your grammar. It's still a very important part of the class.</comment>Make sure you are very confidant in your Spanish because you will be with kids that have already studied abroad</comment>I definitely thought that learning a language through cinema was definitely an interesting and novel way to approach language learning. Some of the movies were a bit hard to understand, but the Spanish subtitles were often a saving grace.</comment>We watched some excellent movies (though many Spanish movies are rather bizarre) - while I am not particularly interested in film, the movies were interesting and sparked good conversation (especially the later ones).</comment>Language classes are, in my opinion, some of the best run classes at Harvard. Using movies as a learning tool should happen way more often.</comment>It's a great class if you have the right teacher. The movies are really good so you should actually watch them and participate a lot in section.</comment>Fantastic class. Try to get Prof. Liander at all costs. Commit to discussions and you will get a lot out of the class.</comment>Great course to practice your Spanish instead of just learning grammar. Easy, but super helpful. Definitely take it if you can speak conversational Spanish and want to get better.</comment>Definitely take this class! Most homework assignments are watching movies, which are the subject of most class discussions. I always looked forward to this class, finding the material interesting and workload very manageable</comment>This is an incredible class. The movies are so interesting and the class in itself is fun and enlightening.</comment>It's an amazing class! Do be sure to spend the time to actually watch the movies though.</comment>If you are interested in exploring a fascinating culture through movies, this is the right class.</comment>It was a great class to take! It's not too hard to set aside time every week to watch the movies - which for the most part are entertaining. If you practice the grammar exercises or are naturally good at remembering the rules, you should be good on tests.</comment>David is an amazing TF! Make sure you actually watch the movies - it makes the discussion much more worthwhile and they are all really interesting.</comment></course>COMPSCI 265: Big Data Systems</title>Excellent course on big data systems. Not just an ordinary database systems course. I learned many fundamental issues that are associated with managing big data platforms and came out with a better understanding of the research and work that is being done in this area</comment>One of the most interesting classes I've ever taken! Lectures are really just round-table discussions on papers, and always fascinating. Take this class even if you don't have any prior database experience (I didn't, and still got a lot out of the class)</comment>This class was phenomenal with Stratos and Manos. They generated a real enthusiasm for topics in database research and structured the class in a very student friendly manner. Definitely one of the most interesting CS classes I've gotten to take. Overall, it will be up to you as far as how much you get out of the course, but it is possible to learn/do a lot.</comment>If you are interested in research or more specifically data systems research-- take this class. Stratos is extremely caring of his students and this class will help you to transition into real research work.</comment>Stratos is really passionate about data systems and spend a lot of time and energy on this course. This is a great class if you are interested in data systems research. It will cover enough breath and depth on most of the new topics and you'll get to interact with visiting scholars.</comment>solid systems background recommended to understand the research papers. be prepared for the backgrounds of students in the class to be highly varied.</comment>TAKE THIS CLASS! I got in the class after having taken CS165 last semester so I had some good exposure to basic database concepts, how column stores work and had read some papers in the field. Throughout the class I learned SO MUCH MORE about big data systems, databases made by Google, Facebook, IBM, about database models, techniques, data analysis, current research topics and also how to think and talk about data processing/storing issues. So, yes, I learned a ton and on top of that got to meet really cool people. Everyone taking the class is really smart and contributed to really cool conversations in class. Also, Professor Idreos and Manos are very knowledgeable, enthusiastic and overall amazing in stirring the conversations to the right places and being inspiring when it comes to actually doing research. And that is the best part of the class. You get to work on your own research project with Professor Idreos about really cool database topics and Stratos is a great advisor. He really manages to keep you motivated, encouraged and help you learn how to go about coming up with your own ideas and explore them. Also, last but not least we had some amazing speakers in the class, including the founder of MemSQL, C. Mohan from IBM research as well as two researchers from HP Labs. That is particularly inspiring because you really get to see what cool computer scientists are doing in industry!!! Need I say more? TAKE CS265 and also take CS165 with Stratos if you have a chance!</comment>Great course, Stratos is a great professor and leads this coure really well!  Highly recommend</comment>For undergrads, this is the continuation of CS165. If you are a CS concentrator considering CS research or CS grad school, this class would be useful. Otherwise you should be highly motivated to learn about current trends in database architectures and design. As the first iteration of this class, this year was quite structure free. Be prepared to discuss about a lot of open-ended questions during class. It is quite beautiful as you can see certain themes and big questions reoccur again even as each class discussion is on a set of different academic data systems papers. For your ongoing final project, be ambitious and swing for the fences on some of these open problems, and dare to solve them!</comment>This course won't kill you if you have a full schedule but the more time you invest the more you will get out of it.</comment>I came from HKS to take this class, so it was very difficult for me to keep up as a non-computer scientist. But I am very glad I tried! The material was eye-opening and the instructors simply excellent.</comment></course>CHNSE 130xa: Pre-Advanced Modern Chinese for Heritage Students</title>Great class! If you are a heritage speaker, you MUST take this class! Don't be intimidated by the syllabus or by past chinese classes. The teachers of 130xa make the class very manageable while still learning a lot at the same time. Also sections with Yeh lao shi are the best and often leads to talking about fun topics like what are modern "hip" words</comment>Liu laoshi da best!</comment>If you're not 100% sure that you want to continue with Chinese or pursue a Chinese, don't take 130xa. You won't make as much progress as you did in the first two years (or two semesters) of your Chinese studies, simply because you've already reached a competent level of speaking and writing. You learn more written Chinese grammar and vocabulary, but if you want to study Chinese to talk to your relatives or to do business, this course isn't really what you're looking for.</comment>If you are looking to improve your Chinese as a heritage speaker (or non-heritage speaker), this is definitely the class to take! Liu Laoshi, Pan Laoshi, and Ye Laoshi are all fantastic professors and wonderful people. Their enthusiasm will make you love Chinese. Coming into the class, I was hesitant because I hadn't really spoken/written/read Chinese in years and was afraid that learning Chinese would become a chore again, with all of the work and assignments this class seemed to require. But you quickly get used to the pace of the course and the weekly assignments become natural to you, and all of the assignments are actually useful in reinforcing your grasp of the material. If you're rusty, 130xa will quickly brush up your reading/speaking/writing skills again, and you'll feel much more comfortable with the language!</comment>This was a good chinese class that didnt require homework everyday. Having said though, there always seemed to be an essay due and we often did writing tasks in lecture class. There were high levels of speaking and discussion and worked towards a more formal speaking and writing language. I enjoyed this class although the work could be frustrating at times, but was not difficult to do well. Teachers were supportive and fun.</comment>Teacher is extremely nice, work is very manageable.</comment>This was a fantastic class. It was engaging and fun, and my Chinese improved a lot as a result of just one semester. I highly recommend this course to anyone considering taking it.</comment>So, I actually took this class after starting last year with Ba and taking 120 at HBA. Needless to say, I am not a heritage speaker. This class was very, very tough, especially as I switched in 3 weeks late, but doable for my skill level. Liu, Pan and Ye laoshi's are all super sweet and were more than wiling to help me when I (frequently) struggled. The structure of the class is fantastic, and the mini projects and timed advertisements felt more applicable to the real world than my previous Chinese classes.  I've had a great time and I know my Chinese has improved-- what more can you ask for?</comment>Try to speak as much as you can in class, even if you feel that others are better at speaking than you are, because this is the main way you will have to improve your spoken Chinese.</comment></course>HIST 76g: Building the Modern Chinese Nation</title>Very good course. Prof. Koll is a delight and a half. The grading is not terribly hard, but it's fair... which makes it harder than some things. Take this course if you already have knowledge of modern and pre-modern Chinese history, and if you're interested in exploring early-modern economic history. Also, this is a good course for working on your research/writing ability because Koll is very helpful in that regard also.</comment>Phenomenal class! Definitely take a class with Professor Koll if you have any interest in this subject area!</comment>This is a seminar with a very lively discussion section. The readings are very very long but if you can get through them, Professor Koll does a good job of making the 2 hours go by quickly.</comment>The readings are really well-selected. Each week has a unifying, and very relevant, theme.</comment>This is a love it or hate it class. If your method of analysis and generally, your opinions, aligns perfectly with the professor's, great. If not, you will struggle very much in this class unless you are willing to conform your methods of analysis, writing, and general opinions to hers. The professor is also not shy about shooting you down completely if any these elements (structure, method of analysis, or argument) are out of line with hers, which means even if your argument is valid, you may still be dismissed.</comment></course>ENG-SCI 176: Introduction to MicroElectroMechanical System</title>This class is a pretty low workload and everything is done in groups which makes it much more enjoyable. Lectures can sometimes be a little disorganized, but overall the course provides a good understanding of MEMS and Microfluidic fabrication techniques.</comment>gives a good introduction to the field of MEMS but not a class that will provide thorough knowledge. professors are great though and very open to discussions in and out of class.</comment>Interesting. Good alternative to googling all the information yourself, since not much original content was presented.</comment>Course load is very manageable and the information learned is interesting and useful. Would be best taken with the intentions of working on a MEMs project outside of class.</comment>You get out what you put in - there is not a lot of mandatory work so it's a good course to balance your schedule. At the same time, this makes it more likely that you won't get as much out of the course as your busy schedule will probably keep you from putting in as much time as you would like. Lectures have too much material in them to absorb in a single two hour lecture. With that said, Habbal and Stark are experts and can answer just about any question you ask them.</comment>This course provides a great overview of MEMS technology and its applications. The coursework is pretty straightforward, and this is a relaxed class overall.</comment>Great, chill class for undergrads. More like a seminar, highly recommend to EE's to balance a heavy schedule.</comment></course>HIST 1620: Modern Vietnam</title>Vietnamese history is richer than most. Hue Tam Ho Tai's is more knowledgeable than most.</comment>A fascinating course. Professor Tai is extremely, almost spookily, knowledgeable about (obviously) Vietnamese history, but all sorts of other things as well. The readings were usually very interesting. Assessments were not too difficult, provided the appropriate work was put in. An unusual class atmosphere in that it was a lecture format, despite being a very small class.</comment></course>GOV 1060: Ancient and Medieval Political Philosophy</title>Mansfield's lectures are wonderful, but not always very easy to follow. Be prepared to spend time outside of class figuring out how things fit together. Nevertheless, this class has a very good reading list and brings up some important political questions.</comment>The lectures and the readings for the course are really interesting, but the final examination might be slightly too challenging.</comment>Anyone who wants a solid foundation in the politics of Western Civilization must take this course. You read great books by great authors, you gain access to an insightful teaching staff more than willing to help you through the material, and you get an opportunity to challenge your thoughts on a host of fundamental questions. Do take, and enjoy!</comment>Take this class, it will make you a better human being.</comment>Strongly recommend this course for those genuinely interested in engaging with the ancient political philosophers with the most respect and least bias from modernity.</comment></course>HISTSCI 240v: Classics in the History of Medicine: Seminar</title>Great class if you are interested in the history of medicine, just be prepared to do a lot of reading. Aaron is one of the best professors so you should definitely take one of his classes</comment>A survey of many important and well known books in the history of medicine. A good idea for anyone considering concentrating in the history of medicine.</comment></course>LING 116: Semantic Theory I</title>Semantics is amazing, so you should take it for that reason alone. It will completely change the way you think about language. Gennaro is a wonderful teacher, who genuinely cares about his students. That said, you will find things immensely easier if you have some rudimentary knowledge of logic going into the class.</comment>This class is very useful if you want to know how to do semantics. Vivid examples and intriguing instructions are given.</comment></course>E&M-REASON 22: Nutrition and Health: Myths, Paradigms, and Science</title>Take this course if you are interested in nutrition and how to live healthy. It gives very valuable information on healthy lifestyles and what you need to know to make good decisions about what you are putting in your body. It can be a little boring (2 hour lecture) but is not at all a big time commitment. All the assignments are manageable and graded fairly.</comment>Lectures can get boring at times, but it's a relatively painless way to get rid of a GenEd.</comment>The EMR22 course focuses heavily on data collection and might not teach as much nutrition content as you would like.</comment>It is a great way to fulfill the EMR requirement without having to do a lot of work.</comment>Very chill class.</comment>Easy class, but the lectures were long and usually terribly boring. Section saved the class.</comment>Take this class!!! I've learned so much and it has positively impacted my life.</comment>make sure you go to section and lecture. they mght be long but if you do that you essentially dont have yo do any of the reading and can do well on exams</comment>Be prepared to endure long lectures..</comment>Basic content. Easy class. Not a lot of time consuming assignments at all. Don't have to read anything for the course. Basic section. Good class to take if you're interested in nutrition (in the slightest bit) and want an easy course. lectures are two hours which can be kinda long, but you can get through it.</comment>For a general overview of nutrition and nutrition-related controversies, this class is great. Lecture is not incredibly engaging, but if you are interested in the subject material that won't be a big deal. Very low work load, but you learn a lot.</comment></course>CULTR&BLF 25: Studying Buddhism, Across Place and Time</title>Buddhism is a deceptively easy class that deals with very complicated philosophies. Not all of this is spelled out and much is open to your interpretation. You will like this class if you want a brief introduction to Buddhism and an understanding about how such a way of thinking (and way of life!) can apply to you. This course is not overly technical and does not require excessive memorization.</comment>Great way to understand the foundations of Buddhism and think critically about a religion on a personal level.</comment>Definitely a great class to fulfill the Culture and Belief requirement. Little work is actually involved and the class is mostly discussion based. It is definitely tailored towards the students - Professor Gyatso very clearly wants students to learn as much as possible while at the same time enjoying studying Buddhism. She is very open to teaching what students want to learn.</comment>This class is boring. Unless you get a really good TF who explains all of the material to you and grades the very difficult papers easily, then it is a grind.</comment>This is a classic case of getting as much out as you put into it. If you don't want to do the reading you can still get a fine grade if you do minimal studying and try on the papers, but it's also some pretty fascinating material if you choose to engage with it. That turns out to be a nice balance, definitely recommend.</comment>Good if you are interested in Buddhism, enjoy philosophy & literature.</comment>The papers are heavily based on the readings, so read. Since no lecture videos are available it's easy to get disconnected from what's going on in class. This stuff is pretty abstract.</comment>If you put in the time and effort, this class can truly be a transformative experience that allows you to better understand yourself and the world around you.</comment>This is a great class but if you do not like Professor Gyatso you will probably not enjoy it much so listen to your instinct during shopping week.  Not too much work but if you aren't interested and want to be there it will be boring and not worth your time.</comment>Great GenEd class with enjoyable lectures, interesting readings and manageable workload. Beware that the class has a big emphasis on looking into the nature of language, and it sometimes feels like a literature class - which is not something I had expected. But great class overall.</comment>It is a good class to learn about the foundations of the principles of Buddhism. However, you really have to put in a lot to this class to get out a lot. Sometimes readings are overwhelming especially as the semester goes on. Not only are they heavy readings but there's a lot of pages. You put in what you get out, though -- and grading doesn't seem to be all that tough. Only 3 essays and a super easy midterm exam. Pretty painless in terms of hours spent on those assignments (except for the daily readings, which are time consuming but flexible in how deeply you examine them).</comment>Interesting class. The readings are long and dense at times, but the class teaches buddhist lessons and concepts that have opened my mind to new ways of thinking.</comment>Boring, despite how fun it might seem in the abstract</comment>Awesome section, interesting material, lectures are tough to get through.</comment>This class is for your soul. And you will also learn about the historical trajectory of Buddhism.</comment>If you take this class, make sure you do the readings! It's easy not to.</comment>I took this class because I was interested in the subject and I ended up with a refreshed approach for interacting in the world. That is vague, but I guess you'll have to take the course! I recommend keeping up with the readings to stay engaged. Also go to any meetings with the monks in the class! Sometimes the lectures felt disorganized.</comment>This was a fun class if you have any interest in Buddhism.  Pay attention during the classes before the quiz -- it's not as easy as they make it sound.</comment>I'm not sure if I would recommend it only because I'm sure their are much more interesting CB classes.</comment>This class is so fun and thought-provoking. I love how it is taught. Changed my life.</comment>This class will challenge you to think in new ways - embrace this opportunity, because it is a special one.</comment>If you're interested in Buddhism at all, this course is a really fascinating intro to the subject, really rewarding</comment>Took this class Pass/Fail. Not many assignments so very low stress. 1 quiz and 3 papers so if you are a good writer and interested in Buddhism definitely take it.</comment>This balance of this course was not what I had expected. I was looking forward to learning mostly about Buddhism's history and the diversity of its religious practices, which we did discuss occasionally, but the foundation of the course was trying to understand and define Buddhist concepts and theory, which was not something I really wanted to do. If you are more interested in the history and culture than in pulling apart the meaning of enlightenment, this is probably not the right course for you. I still enjoyed it--just not as much as I might have in a Buddhism course with a slightly different focus.</comment>This is such a nice oasis from other classes because Janet Gyatso literally just wants you to breathe, and think about life, and think about yourself, and learn how to be your best.</comment>Professor Gyatso is a very open-minded professor who supports all of the students in her class. She is incredibly generous with whatever time she has and is extremely supportive of exploring class themes in student extracurriculars and their lives outside of the lecture. You will love her and the experience, and you will also discover that the class is more about how to be a compassionate person than just the basic material of studying the history of Buddhism.</comment>This class provided a great introduction to Buddhism for students with no background in the subject. It occasionally felt a bit unfocused, but Professor Gyatso is wonderful and lectures were always entertaining and interesting. The course readings were great, but there is little pressure to actually do all of them, so you have to be quite self-motivated. Overall a great class, but like most gen eds you get out of it what you put in.</comment>Take this class!! If you are even remotely interested in knowing a little more about a different culture and Buddhism, you should absolutely take this course! It was amazing and interesting and I will be including Buddhism in my everyday life now :)</comment>It's worth it if you find the existential questions absolutely riveting from day 1.</comment>This class is extremely interesting and I would definitely recommend it.</comment>Professor Gyatso tends to go on tangents that make the lectures feel very unstructured and a bit unmemorable. Despite the attendance system, this discouraged me to attend lectures on time or during periods of high stress.</comment>Professor Gyatso is great! There is a lot of freedom for interpretation in this class and it covers lots and lots of interesting concepts in Buddhism. The reading definitely increased in volume per week which made it hard to keep up with during mid terms and towards the end of the semester but there were lots of great texts so it was worth it. Great gen ed.</comment>Professor Gyatso is an amazing and spiritually advanced person who you will learn a lot from. Course is manageable and deeply informative and enjoyable.</comment>This is a great course for anyone who has been curious about Buddhist culture and philosophy.</comment>Super interesting class. Do not be discouraged by the first third of the course, since the background knowledge will be important later on even though it may seem dry to start with. Do try to do the readings and some self-reflection because otherwise you'd have no idea what is going on in lecture, and it is so much more valuable and meaningful if you've done the readings.</comment>TAKE. THIS. CLASS. I can't imagine a better way to fulfill my CB Gen-Ed requirement. The reading material is interesting, the lectures are fun, the teaching staff is amazing, and it doesn't require an unnecessary amount of work. If you make the effort to actually do the readings and think about the larger themes it covers, the ideas you are exposed to can genuinely change your life and worldview. Cannot recommend highly enough!</comment>If you've ever been interested in buddhism, eastern traditions, or continental philosophy, take this class.  TFs are highly knowledgable and very motivated, and Professor Gyatso is a pleasure to engage with -- thoughtful lectures range from hilarious to poignant in tone.  Reading is at times substantial, but the experience rewards you in spades for taking the time to do it.  Essays leave you pretty free to engage with the course material however you see fit.</comment>As I sit down to write this, I am confident in my growth as a result of this class, both as a student and as a person. This class has confirmed some of my own thoughts on Buddhism and life, and as corny as it sounds, please take this class seriously and as an introduction to a new way to look at life, something I have applied to myself as soon as I understood (at least I think I did) the ideas of this class.</comment>Really makes you think!</comment>Make sure that you are ready to sit through long lectures.  I wasn't able to do all of the readings (of which there is alot), but the readings are pretty interesting.  Some weeks drag on a little bit, but the beginning and end of the course is very interesting.  I think it is worthwhile if you have a general interest in Buddhism.  It is nice not having to do a huge final paper or project, and the TFs are generally accommodating.</comment>Take this class. The pros outweigh the cons. 

Pro: really interesting material, with a huge range. 
Cons: lots of material that is not evenly distributed. You will be confused. 
Pro: You are expected to be confused and you should be confused. Once you accept that you are going to be confused and not understand specific concepts, but rather only get the main idea, then you learn a lot. It's hard to grasp, because it feels better to say you learned X, Y, Z, history, etc, but the class is rewarding because you answer big life questions. To do that though, talk to the TFs. They are so big picture that it's intimidating or awkward to talk to them, but once you start talking and just point to specific things in the books or are straight with them and say: "I don't get it, what am I supposed to be learning here?" - they will respond back. 

Put in 50% of effort and you will learn a lot.</comment>This is perhaps the best class I have taken here.
Excellent course. Gyatso is a superb, funny, and engaged lecturer that makes you reconsider the way that you see life, reality, others, and yourself. Honestly a life-changing course, made my semester really enjoyable by giving me the tools to approach academics, time-management and life in general in a joyful and tranquil manner.
This course showed me the light: it was the perfect tool to approach my other classes and my personal life with joy, compassion and serenity. It was possibly the best class to teach me how to be happy (i.e., not SEEK happiness) and be compassionate.</comment>It's interesting but disorganized and if you aren't really interested in the material to begin with, you might find it easy to slack off and not get that much out of the course. It is fairly easy and not time-consuming.</comment>The course is great. The professor is so enthusiastic and makes you so interested in the material. You get the chance to ask any questions, even the dumbest ones you can think of and its alright. I loved it. Take the course.</comment>This class gives you a new lens with which to understand new knowledge, experiences, and people.</comment>Professor Gyatso is a very dedicated, effective, and great professor, and her class is amazing. After the class, I always feel happier, keep a smile on my face, and have peace in my mind. Professor Gyatso guides students to actually apply the theory that is learned in class and from the readings. For example, she arranges for the class to be able to attend a meditation class, be able to converse with monks, act out skits from the Lotus Sutra, listen to music with Buddhist meanings, and encourages a lot of discussion. She herself creates a calm and peaceful environment in the class. I recommend you take this class with great enthusiasm!</comment>This class is hands-down amazing. I've never had the fortune of studying under such a supportive, knowledgeable, and understanding teaching staff. All the readings in CB25 are very down-to-earth, but also extremely timeless in their themes. Through the guidance of Prof. Gyatso, we not only get to see the elegance of a Buddhist approach to life, but we also learnt how to take a step back, and neutrally consider values, beliefs, and ideas of Buddhism that we engage in deep debate with before we accept or deny. I think this ability to gain a bird's eye-view is probably the one thing that will allow me to think more critically of anything later in life, Buddhist or not. I would strongly recommend this class to anyone who is interested in Buddhism or general religious studies, in aesthetics, in literature, in philosophy, or in East/ South Asian Studies.</comment>This is a great class. It's super interesting, the teacher's great and the TFs are wonderful. There is a lot of reading but they aren't all totally neccessary to understand the course, however, you will get more out of it if you do. They are interesting, though a bit dense. And the course becomes a bit abstract; if that's not for you, it can be frustrating.</comment>Not very fascinating, just a dry overview of Buddhism and buddhist texts.</comment>There are better CB classes you could take! Don't take this one!</comment>This is a relatively painless way to meet the Culture and Belief gened. Assignments are relatively few and not graded too harshly. I wasn't a fan of Professor Gyatso's lecture style, which consisted of largely undirected rambling with little semblance of structure or organization. I guess some people enjoy that though.</comment>The only reason I can't recommend this course "With Enthusiasm" is because of the lecture component. The readings are intriguing, the TFs are skilled discussion leaders, and the required essays range from easy to deeply personally fulfilling. 

All that being said, lecture is a slog. Each lecture begins with a series of unvetted student questions selected at random from the pile of index cards which served as last lecture's attendance-taking process (yes, they take attendance). The lectures themselves were unfocused and interminable, frequently interrupted by the six students who regularly took Prof. Gyatso up on her offer to address any hands raised at any point - any point at all - during her lecture. These lectures are slow if you find the readings challenging; if you have already done a bit of Buddhist study on your own, they will seem to last for hours on end.

I recommend this class if you are the type who can zone out during lecture or, better yet, quietly do something productive with that hour and a half twice per week. If you need strong, compelling lectures as part of your class experience, this is not the course for you.</comment>The lectures are interesting to listen to, and the material was really fascinating. Most of the course is based on outside reading that is then discussed in class.</comment>DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS as your introduction to Buddhism under any circumstances. Lectures are awful, totally unstructured, and as hard to follow as they are mandatory. I took this class because I had always thought Buddhism was an interesting and unique religion, full of curious paradoxes and unorthodox metaphysical ideas. It is, but that's not what you learn about in this class. You do a lot more of studying lame pedantic differences between writers and schools than considering the cool ideas underneath it all.</comment>This class is not particularly hard, but it is a very academic approach to Buddhism, and is less focussed on the cultural aspects as I would have liked.</comment>Take this class if you are interested in learning about Buddhism.  Professor Gyatso and the teaching fellows are incredible.  Be aware that, while there are a lot of reading assignments, there are only three papers and one quiz over the entire semester.</comment>Wonderful class - it is as much work as you want it to be. If you take the time to do the readings, you may them sticking with you far longer than you would have originally imagined.</comment>The work load is not that difficult and is definitely manageable. However, it was somewhat disorganized and hard to follow.</comment>The 1st half of the course is great in terms of learning more about Buddhism, and the essays are graded fairly. But the 2nd half is excessive and boring, and very few people read those texts (instead, the instructor should only pick a few texts, and then focus on those)</comment>I would definitely recommend this course, not as an easy Gen-Ed necessarily, but as a course that will change the way you think. Be prepared to actually do the readings and go to lecture (they take attendance), but if you are willing to put in the effort, you will get a lot out of this course. It changed the way I think about belief systems and about life in general.</comment>This is a great thinking course and will make you walk around considering the real-world applications of week's lectures. No prior experience necessary! Challenging but rewarding work load. (You don't have to do all the readings. Just read in-depth the ones that you find interesting.)</comment>Stay up with the reading and meet with your TF if you have questions/concerns, especially about written assignments</comment>Professor Gyatso clearly cares so much about this class and about her students. She bleeds passion for her subject, and it really shows. Take this class if you want to learn about this subject from someone who can get you excited about it.</comment></course>SOCIOL 22: Men, Women, and Work</title>I loved this class so much. I learned so much, and I actually feel like it made me a better person and a more educated citizen.</comment>This class gave a great overview about the issues that women face in the workplace and why they continue to persist.</comment>This class was very relevant to life after Harvard, and the readings were some of the best I've ever had in a class. We didn't spend too much time discussing in lecture, but overall the course was enjoyable. Excellent for someone who has never taken a Soc course before. I would highly recommend this course for seniors as they apply for jobs.</comment>Although the information presented in this class might seem interesting, the class itself is not very interesting and lacks structure. It is a frustrating course.</comment>Only take this course if you are really interested in the topic. Even though Mary is an amazing person and researcher (one of the best in her field), she is a poor lecturer, and you will feel like you are not learning much and struggling at the same time. The material, however, is very interesting.</comment>If you are interested in gender inequality within the workplace, Prof. Brinton is the most amazing resource for the subject and the class if very informative.</comment>Professor Brinton is really nice and very knowledgeable. However, this class is not academically rigorous; I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who has taken sociology classes or women's studies courses in the past.</comment>The course is very interesting with reasonable readings.</comment>I recommend this class because it is interesting and useful for real-world conversations.</comment>As an MCB concentrator, I hadn't taken a dedicated humanities course before, so I didn't really know what to expect. I had a few misgivings at the beginning (total lack of audiovisual anything in the teaching process, inability to make section due to scheduling conflicts), but I soon found that I enjoyed the course and found it to be very painless. The readings are short; the midterms are pretty easy as long as you do the readings; the final paper isn't bad at all if you start early (which I unfortunately was not able to due to another final).</comment>Stay engaged with the instructors. Ask for practice questions and get acquainted with their style of grading before taking the first one.</comment>This course is really interesting — for the readings. Those are great! You'll learn a lot. But might as well just get those from a friend/download the syllabus and read them on your own. Prof. Brinton's lectures were almost astonishingly unhelpful. They rarely focused on the readings we had just done, since we fell behind after about 2 classes, and even when they did, they were mostly just review of what the author had said, with very little analysis. Otherwise she would waste half of class time telling anecdotes from her personal life, or, my favorite, when she used an entire class to have us help her come up with ideas for a talk she was supposed to give later that day. There's very little encouragement of discussion, or, really, critical thinking at all — the exams are explicitly non-analytical, and just expect you to regurgitate information you've learned. 

So yeah — don't bother.</comment>The expectations of this course are not made clear. You will be assigned little to no work every week aside from the readings, so your grade is mostly made up from your midterm grades and final paper. The professor stresses precision when answering the midterm questions (think verbatim from the readings) so it is difficult to do well in the exams. Discussions during lecture and sections were not helpful in clarifying course material, and often went off topic.</comment>Don't be fooled by the fact that this is an intro-level course. If this is your first sociology course, you'll struggle on the midterms and on the final essay. Writing for a sociology class is very different from writing for an English class or a history class; sociology may be a "soft" science, but it requires very precise and scientific writing. If you don't figure out what the professor wants from you in terms of writing early on in the course, your grade will suffer.</comment>This course has really interesting subject material. It's important to do all of the readings in this course, if you want to really engage in the class discussions, and also to do well on the midterm exams. The final paper was a bit confusing to navigate as well, as the prompt evolved and changed toward the end of the semester. Overall, a good course.</comment>This course's topic and materials are extremely interesting and relevant to Harvard students. However, the course is tricky. The grading is tough, and there's little feedback. The class had so much potential but it fell a little short.</comment>The material of this course is interesting but it was taught horribly and I would not recommend taking it if Prof. Brinton is teaching it again. She is not a good or engaging lecturer and just wanted us to regurgitate what the readings said, yet she did not make clear exactly which points from the readings were most important or if we interpreted them incorrectly in class. She spent way too much time talking about tangential or wholly irrelevant things in class for far too much time, like how she runs faculty meetings or what she would say in a presentation at the Kennedy School or how her daughter's teachers are. I left every class bored and feeling like I had learned nothing and wasted my time, which is saying a LOT since I am really interested in the topic of women in the workplace and the readings we did. Section was the same in lack of interest and engagement.</comment></course>PHYSICS 247r: Laboratory Course in Contemporary Physics</title>Best course I took at Harvard</comment></course>TIBET 150: Bod, Bod chen po, and the historical geography of the Tibetan cultural area</title>Take this class because it is extremely rare that this subject matter ever gets taught, and also taught so well.</comment></course>NEUROBIO 101hfb: Dopamine</title>This is an awesome tutorial so far! It's not incredibly difficult but covers difficult material. I would definitely say I learned a lot.</comment>This is the biggest gem I have ever taken, while also being one of the classes I have most enjoyed, and a class where I have learned a lot. First semester, we had two homeworks that each took around 30 minutes. Barak's lectures are dynamic, exciting, and interactive, and you come to realize how much you can learn without killing yourself outside of class. Best class ever.</comment>Having taught students and undergone extensive teaching training as an undergrad, I know how difficult teaching can be. I think Barak possesses natural teaching ability and charisma. I was always enthusiastic to attend his class, especially since I wouldn't have to worry about turning in exhausting assignments. I'd walk in every Monday, sit back, and learn something interesting that I'd use in my other courses and blow my professors away. I also had a memorable conversation with him outside of class, which revealed to me how much of a chill and approachable guy he is. It's obvious why my friends from other Neuro tutorials were envious that they didn't get into Dopamine.</comment>This is an amazing course. Barak is a great lecturer who always keeps the class engaged. Although there is not as much week to week work as compared to other classes, I feel like I've learned so much more in this class by just paying attention and note taking than I have in many other classes I've taken. I recommend this class to those interested in pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, Parkinson's and learning about brain pathways.</comment>Already one of the best classes I have taken at Harvard and it's only been 1/2 the course.</comment>This is easily the most engaging, interesting, and fun course I have taken at Harvard. If you somehow manage to lottery in, you would be an idiot not to enroll.</comment>Take this course! Barack is awesome! Workload is modest and doable. Too bad this course won't be offered next year.</comment></course>PSY 1508: How to Nudge: Using Social Psychology and Decision Science to Change Behavior and Policy</title>Such an applicable course (which is hard to find at Harvard). The teaching staff is amazing, and the class is very manageable. They really want you to succeed. If you are interested in policy, marketing, or psychology in general, this material will be very interesting to you.</comment>Very interesting and relevant material for those looking to apply psychological principles to public policy, marketing, start-ups, or just making good choices in everyday life. Cool opportunity to engage material creatively with a group project. Real cool guest speakers from the "nudge" departments in US and UK governments today. Lectures could have been a bit more exciting, but overall a really great class.</comment>The material of this class is incredibly compelling, and that is enough reason to take this class. Marty is no Dan Gilbert or Josh Green, but he does his best to make the material interesting and he shows genuine interest in getting to know the students and getting the students not only to learn the material, but also to apply it. The assignments are SUPER easy, but take them seriously because they matter a lot. Take the class!</comment>This is in my opinion a must-take course if you're remotely interested in the subject matter. What's more, it's one of the few hands-on/applied courses - let alone PSYCH courses - taught at Harvard. The whole science of nudging and choice architecture is hugely relevant to anyone interested in making businesses, policies, programs, and even personal efforts in their own lives more effective. Since this was its first run, there are some kinks to work out, but overall this is already a fantastic course. The workload is very manageable and complements the material well. The final project especially was an incredibly enjoyable way to apply psych principles to solve a social issue. All in all I'd strongly recommend this course if it sounds at all interesting to you.</comment>Wonderful material that I enjoyed reading and engaging with, but poorly taught and explained. Much of the learning from this class needs to come from within, but the actual material is great!</comment>This course offers a great introduction to the field of behavior psychology. Every single aspect of the course, from the assignments to the organization of lectures, is extremely intentional. All around interesting material and I really enjoyed Professor Day.</comment>This course has interesting content material. However, it does not engage with it rigorously. If you are looking for an easy class with relevant readings, this class would be fine. If you want to go in-depth, the same or similar material is covered in other courses--Social Psychology, Decision Making and Negotiation, etc.</comment>Very interesting course. Fairly easy. Not the most rigorous.</comment>Take it! It's a very manageable psychology course and probably one of my favorite courses I have taken at Harvard. You get a really great overview of behavioral economics and social psychology, and the opportunity to work in group projects is also very rewarding.</comment>Lecture can be a little boring if you don't force yourself to stay engaged (and then you just have no idea what Prof is talking about) but SUPER helpful if you want to go into marketing or any kind of public policy work. Guest lecturers were great and the group project was very manageable since you do it over the course of the semester</comment>The grading done by Kay was sometimes unclear and misguided. Even when feedback was taken into consideration, no changes in grades or sense of improvement was felt. It was like you were already placed into a certain grade scale and you could not move up.</comment>This course has great potential - if the logistics were to be ironed out in future versions of the classes and feedback were to be more constructive and pointed, this could be a worthwhile course. As it was taught this first semester, however, I would only recommend it for the project in which students had to propose an intervention for a real world behavioral problem.</comment>Its boring after the first few lectures</comment>Although the topic is fascinating, the course is not compelling. Lectures recapitulate the readings without adding much depth, and the applied case study portion consists of ten minute in-class exercises that don't require more than a superficial understanding of concepts. And assignments are incredibly redundant, creating a low effort to reward ratio. To be fair, this was the first year that the course was taught, so it may improve. However, as it stands, if you are interested in behavioural science, I would recommend making your own way through the reading list (which is excellently curated) and skipping the course itself.</comment>Great class! Dr. Day is a really great person, though lectures may seem repetitive and slow if you've already read Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman. The concepts are really interesting, though I think everything can be taught at a faster pace. The teaching staff really holds your hand through the process.</comment>The course content was fascinating and the final project was a really useful experience. Could be a little slow at times but did really enjoy it overall.</comment>Very fun class! Assignments are minimal, but the final report is unnecessarily lengthy. Marty is also great!</comment>Anyone with a strong interest in nudging/behavioral economics/decision science should take this class, as it takes a lot of theoretical concepts and applies them, which is fascinating to see.</comment>This class will be better the next time it is taught. The material is interesting.</comment>Interesting material, lectures can be a little dry. Worth taking if interesting in behavioral economics.</comment>This class is great for anyone interested in learning about nudges/behavioral economics. While the class starts off slow, it does eventually pick up. You learn about the factors behind nudges, as well as about interventions that utilized them. Although there aren't many cases for students to analyze, you do get to plan an intervention at the end of the semester. Guest speakers are a huge highlight! They've done a lot of amazing work and are more than happy to talk about it with you. Professor Day can be a little condescending at times, but overall he's a fairly good instructor. I recommend it for anyone who wants to learn about possible applications of psychology outside of grad school.</comment>This is an interesting course but the scope is much smaller than you would expect, with good reason. Nudges are very hard to implement on a large scale, so don't think this will teach you how to control the rise and fall of nations with your mind. Marty is a really nice guy and very smart, but the lectures are not all that entertaining so the actual classtime could be a bit dry.</comment>This is a really neat class! Marty (as he tells us to call him!) is quite knowledgable about the topic and always includes lots of thorough explanations and examples in his lectures. He is also very receptive to comments and questions and does a great job at providing help and support when asked. Be aware though, that there are quite a few assignments involved. They're not always difficult, but they do require you to sit down and take the time to do them. Especially when group work is involved, this can be challenging because of everyone's hectic schedules. It's a really fascinating, unique class that does things a little differently (final poster presentations!), but the grading is not that easy.</comment>Had a LOT of potential, but the discussions made it difficult to engage the material deeply. People would say BS in class, and no matter what was said the professor would respond positively. I felt like anyone from the street could just come in there and be a contributing member. I wish the course had focused more on the psychological concepts, and I wish students had been pushed more in class to really justify the concepts they were applying. The course is supposed to be about applications of nudges, but all I learned to do is throw various concepts at the problem until something sticks.

Also, this made doing the assignments kinda difficult. I wasn't sure how to actually do the DDDT process (the process by which interventions are created), so when we were asked to do it on the assignments I wasn't sure what to do.

Also, the final project. It was the same workload and tasks as the individual assignments (1000 words ea.), but now you have to coordinate it among 3-5 people. Good intentions, but sometimes we would step on each other's toes a bit.

If Professor Day fixes some of the above problems (this was his first year teaching it here), I could see this becoming an incredible course.</comment></course>STAT 300hfr: Research in Statistics</title>The best way to know and learn from the current research in the Statistics Department.</comment></course>SOC-STD 98lf: Globalization and the Nation State</title>This is a fantastic course. Nicolas created a space for some of the most fascinating conversations I have ever had. The course did an excellent job applying theory and philosophy to the study of globalization. One thing to point out: although this course helped me think about ideas for possible thesis topics, there was not all that much emphasis on learning methods.</comment>Nicolas is incredibly nice and a great teacher. The material is also super interesting, although more focused on Europe than you might expect. We had excellent discussions, and a lot of the readings are fascinating. You have almost complete freedom in choosing your final paper topic and methods, but it can also be a bit frustrating that there are no guidelines or specific requirements. Start thinking about how you're going to approach your topic early, so that you can write a paper that's really worthwhile.</comment>A really great class that touches on a diverse set of topics that could excite anyone in social studies. You can bring in as little, or as much, theory as you would like. Dr. Prevelakis is super awesome and guides class discussions well. The weekly memo is not too much work and most of the readings are very interesting. The class discussions were great - the other students in the tutorial brought in outside knowledge that made for rich and fascinating conversations. I am sad that the class is over, but am happy to have had such a rewarding experience in social studies.</comment>This course is possibly the best one I have taken at Harvard. Its subject matter is fascinating - linking two concepts that aren't always thought about together. The discussions were of a high level, and to me demonstrated the best of what a discussion-based seminar could look like. I really felt a sense of community with my classmates as well over the course of the semester. The readings were both incredibly broad and meaningfully deep, and Dr. Prevelakis was great at guiding discussions. He is also engaged outside of class, and clearly cares about his students, even bringing us coffee to class every week. I would highly recommend taking this course.</comment>If you are at all thinking about writing your thesis on national identity, globalization, or anything involving the integration of different groups of people, I strongly suggest that you consider this tutorial. You will not regret it.</comment>This is a great course! Chances are that if you're looking at this course you have to take a Social Studies seminar; if so, this is one of the best, in my opinion. Nicolas is awesome, the readings are great, and discussion is fantastic. Just know that you will have to write a 20-25-page term paper at the end of it.</comment></course>HIST-LIT 90be: Tropical Fantasies: The Hispanic Caribbean and Haiti in the Global Imaginary</title>It's very informative about something you probably did not have extensive instruction about prior</comment>This is a great intro course to the history and literature department and is part of the reason why I decided to concentrate in hist and lit. The history of the Caribbean is not usually taught in high school or in general history courses, so it is really cool to get a chance to study the Caribbean so specifically. Having Achy Obejas and Junot Diaz talk to us after we read their novels was also an amazing experience.</comment>This class is a great opportunity to study a region that is underserved in academic discourse. The readings are all engaging, and the load is relatively light.</comment>This course was a mess. The assignments and homework were unclear, and little to no help was available. The subject matter may sound interesting, but I didn't feel like I actually learned much about it. The professor didn't seem to care about the course at all. Don't take it.</comment>If your interested in the caribbean, it's a must; if you're not, then you will be.</comment></course>AESTH&INTP 14: Putting Modernism Together</title>This course is best enjoyed after taking an intro in art history. In that case, the course will be immensely interesting and worthwhile. Otherwise, you will be lost at times in terms of how everything fits together because the course delves into individual movements without the connecting pieces. The lectures can be hard to follow because there's no real apparent structure. The reading is a lot, but it's possible to not do it one week and catch up. The papers aren't bad except the final paper is a struggle.</comment>This class was amazing. Requires very little work but the benefits you reap from the lectures and discussions are extensive! Although the course was very ambitious in scope and doesn't include a lot of important elements/movements within modernism (especially in the literature department) I feel like I can now converse intelligently about modernism. Also Daniel Albright is a genius and listening to him lecture is like listening to poetry for an hour twice a week.</comment>Wonderful introduction to art history. I used several textbooks in addition to course material, which gave the class a much better structure. As is, the course is a little unstructured and definitely has more of a literary and associative feel to it.</comment>Some sort of artistic background is required.</comment>Take this course if you are interested in taking a quintessential college humanities course. It introduces you to various artistic mediums in a way you will not get in other courses, and Professor Albright's lectures are more like extended poems than lectures. The workload is mild and if you put in the time you can get a lot out of the course.</comment>This course provides both a broad and in-depth overview of the artistic movements of Modernism. It greatly raised my awareness of painting and music, and I feel much more well-versed in art history than beforehand. My only reservation is that the assignments were more rigorous and seemed to be held to a higher standard than most Gen Ed work.</comment>As a lecturer and a scholar, Prof Albright is the closest we have to a bonafide witch at Harvard. I am not aware of him every denying such a claim. He is magical. Take this class.</comment>lots of assignments</comment>It's a great class that gives you a broad overview of the Modern era and familiarizes you with key works</comment>Truly beautiful class, but what you get out of it is proportional to the amount of work you put in. If you coast through the course, which you can, you won't get so much.</comment>A lot of reading and a lot of writing but you learn to see music painting and literature from new perspectives.</comment>Modernism is fascinating and Albright is a good lecturer for it.</comment>Don't take this class if you don't like art.  I took this class because I thought it would be an easy way to fulfill the gen ed, but I couldn't get myself to do the reading because I had no interest in the course.  It ended up being a nightmare.</comment>Its quite difficult</comment>This course requires a large amount of reading but it is so worth it because of how interesting each piece of literature is. Additionally, the lectures are simply fascinating. Finally, I can look at art now and have an idea of what the artist is trying to say.</comment>This class was really transformative for me.  Professor Albright is absolutely brilliant and very accessible, section was always creative and engaging, and I came away with a deep appreciation for something I knew almost nothing about coming in.  The readings can be a little long, but they're worth doing because everything included in the course helps build a strong cultural foundation that can help you make connections and understand references in any field.</comment>This is a pretty good A&I. More work than I would have liked out of a GenEd, but you can reduce the amount of work by doing a student presentation instead of a second paper. If you choose not to do the paper then you will have to write two short papers, in addition to a midterm take-home exam and a final term paper and final take-home exam. So it's is certainly not a joke as far as deliverable work goes. But for someone who didn't have any background in literature or art, I feel like I was able to really enhance my understanding about a subject I knew nothing about. That is in large part due to the fact that this course covers a wide range of subjects.</comment>Use a laptop to take notes during lecture. Otherwise you won't be able to keep up.</comment>The subject matter is really interesting and some of the readings opened my eyes in unexpected ways, but the way in which all of this is delivered isn't engaging and is fairly impersonal. It's very easy to feel little accountability to do readings or to participate or try with assignments.</comment>This is an excellent class: Professor Albright is a luminary in the field (and also very approachable), the students come from many backgrounds but are highly talented (as is evident from the project presentations), and the readings are very carefully selected and engaging in content.</comment>Heads up: this course is 1/3 visual art, 1/3 music, and 1/3 literature (I had thought it would be more literature, but was glad to have my horizons broadened)
You get as much out of this course as you put in; you can get away with doing none of the readings and still do quite well on the take home midterm and final, but I honestly wouldn't recommend doing that.  There isn't much work at all, and that work isn't hard, but each piece is chosen so carefully to make you consider larger questions about philosophy and the human psyche.  Lectures are fabulous and help with this too--Albright is weird as all hell and a downright genius.
That being said, it was very nice to be able to skip the reading during a week when I had a lot of work in another class.  There's also a high chance that you've read, looked at, or listened to some of the work beforehand.  [Simos is a friendly and helpful TF]</comment>Section is engaging and exciting! It really got me out of my comfort zone</comment>This course is what you make of it. If you cruise through the lectures, and when the essay comes around apply what you learned in SS 10 or something to the material, you may be just fine, but you won't really feel that much of a benefit from the material. If you put in more effort, however, the rewards are commensurate.</comment>Even though there is a lot of take home work such as short paper, quizzes and a term paper, the readings, music and paintings that you look at in class give one a complete understanding of the Modernist movement.  The Professor's lectures do a great job of analyzing the art and giving it more meaning in the broader context of the Modernist movement.</comment>The course is easy, overall, but I'm not sure I could recommend it. Lectures are frustrating and without much noticeable organization -- Professor Albright will, for example, mumble the name of a German composer without spelling it on the board or on the syllabus, leaving students to butcher the spelling in their notes. It's difficult to locate themes or unifying threads throughout lectures. A disappointing class because the material seemed quite interesting</comment>A good class if you're interested in the material.</comment>an awesome fusion of the cultural manifestations of modernist beliefs</comment></course>MUSIC 250hf: Colloquium on Teaching Pedagogy</title>Take this course seriously and you'll get invaluable tools out of it.</comment>It's a wonderful opportunity to think through your approach in the classroom.</comment></course>EXPOS 20.042: Why Shakespeare?</title>It's Expos, you'll be really lucky if you get a section you enjoy. This class is great if you want to read Shakespeare's two longest plays and do more of the type of writing you did in high school. If you want to get more of an idea of other types of writing, this is not the class for you. Additionally, this class is not at all discussion-based, as some Expos sections are.</comment>Some weeks, the workload for this course will be much heavier than other weeks, and some weekends will be very much devoted to writing for this class.   You have to take Expos. When compared to other Expos sections, this one's pretty good. I would recommend it.</comment>Very helpful and interesting</comment>This course is required, but should not be looked at with anguish.</comment>If you enjoy Shakespeare at all, and Jeffrey Wilson is teaching this course, definitely take this. Wilson will give you a lot of attention if you need it, and he's so well versed with Shakespeare that you'll surely learn a lot about Shakespeare while improving your writing.</comment>This Expos course might be a little difficult if you don't have interest in Shakespeare and close readings.</comment>That many of the skills you learn will not only become useful in the next coming years, it may actually help you that semester. You will need to write papers and essays in other classes, and the skills you learn in Expos will help in that process. t</comment>This course requires a significant amount of effort. In addition, one should take the class if one is interested in Shakespearean studies. Otherwise, I do not recommend the class.</comment>Wilson is incredible. For an expos class, I actually really enjoyed it and I learned a lot. Shakespeare can be daunting, but Wilson makes it really fun.</comment>Take this class if you have any interest in Shakespeare at all, or if you have read and enjoyed one of Shakespeare's plays. All Expos classes have the same basic structure, so it is important that you pick a topic that interests you. In this class you try to answer the major question of why we read Shakespeare, looking at his plays, film adaptations, as well as academic research on the subject.
It is hard to compare it to other Expos classes that I have not experienced, but if you enjoy Shakespeare, I recommend this class and believe you will have a positive experience.</comment>This course successfully lived up to the expectation of the expos nightmare. Although the material itself was good, class felt like an unpleasant waste of time and the preceptor was often caught up in his own defensive complexes. The few large essays and the editing process may have been useful for the future, but I struggle to come up with a defense for the class otherwise.</comment>More than a Shakespeare course, this is a writing course. Your ability to craft an effective argument will be more important than your ability to say something meaningful about Shakespeare. In fact, it is impressed upon you from the beginning that as a freshman you won't really be saying anything groundbreaking about Shakespeare, and should instead focus on "contributing to the critical conversation." Anyways- Wilson is a great prof, very engaging, hilarious, and passionate about Shakespeare. This class is a lot about how much you put into it. Getting good grades is difficult. Some passion and familiarity with Shakespeare is very helpful and more or less assumed, if you're going to be able to keep up with class discussions. The ability to quote Hamlet on the spot is especially impressive.</comment>This class is as much about thinking and translating your ideas into writing as it is about Shakespeare. Come into it with an open mind.</comment></course>ENGLISH 40: Arrivals</title>This course is a manageable and enjoyable introduction into a wide variety of old- and middle-English literature. Professor Donoghue is a very approachable and encouraging professor who creates an atmosphere which encourages student's participation.</comment>Professor Donoghue is an amazing educator and one of the most approachable professors I have studied under here at Harvard thus far. The course is relatively painless with fun and interactive projects, and I highly recommend it to everyone!</comment>You read lots of good/important stuff. Don't expect to get a lot out of it besides plots points and historical/biographical background. An easy course.</comment>The teaching staff is lovely and the material is often interesting, however it seems haphazardly put together and without much of a shape leaving the course somewhat confused overall.</comment>DD is the bomb.com. So modest and clearly loves teaching and the subject matter. Take his arrivals! It's a good idea.</comment>English 40 is definitely not the most exciting English course I've taken at Harvard so far, but it's an easy and okay way to fulfill the Arrivals requirement for the concentration. Definitely don't take this if not for the concentration req. While Donoghue is a nice professor and well-intentioned, his lectures can sometimes get a bit dull, and sections can feel kind of dead, despite the fact that everyone in the class should be excited about English because we're presumably all English concentrators or prospectives!</comment>Professor Donoghue was great.  He clearly loves the material he teaches, and so does the TF Porter.  The two of them together formed an excellent team that gave character to what most would consider "boring." They brought these canonical texts to life.  I would recommend this as a solid way to do the Arrivals requirement, but it's not the best intro English class (and it shouldn't be) because of the course material.</comment>This is a fun and relatively painless way to fulfill the arrivals requirement. There are frequently small assignments due between each class, so if that's not your style, take another section of arrivals.</comment>This class was alright, nothing I would rave about. But if you are genuinely interested in the texts of this time period, then I would recommend it. The way the class was set up (half lecture, half discussion) was really nice, and Dr. Donoghue and Porter White are both very kind, reasonable people.</comment>This is a wonderful way to fulfill the Arrivals requirement. I had been putting off Arrivals because I normally prefer contemporary literature, but I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this class. Professor Donoghue introduces the material beautifully, and I liked that section followed lecture.</comment>This class is really fun. It exposes you to all kinds of literature that will likely come up again as an English Concentrator and even if you're not planning on that concentration, it's still a worthwhile experience as anyone who loves English literature. Professor Donoghue is a really great professor so I would take his class specifically, if I were you. He's enthusiastic and really cares about the students. I plan on taking more of his classes because he's just so great.</comment>Really good staff, material</comment>You will get a good taste of English literature from Beowulf up through Milton. If you are particularly interested in just one period (Old English, Renaissance, Metaphysical, etc), however, this class will not be satisfying. This class is a fair use of your time, and it doesn't take more from you than necessary to engage you in the texts. The assignments are fair, and I encourage you to talk them over with Professor Donaghue or the TF to grow from the experience.</comment>As far as Arrivals courses go, I think this is a great choice. Dr. Donoghue is very kind, and actively encourages discussion and questioning. Assignments were varied, not just writing but also creative projects; we took trips to Houghton Library and to a calligraphy class that were really fun. Porter was a wonderful TF: deeply invested in each of her students, and brought tea and coffee to every section! Get ready to read quickly, and to read a variety of materials: won't go too in-depth on any particular work.</comment>This is a good way to fill the english Arrivals core requirement, but if you're looking for a cool reading class, this does get a bit dry.</comment></course>GOV 94fp: The Military Instrument of Foreign Policy</title>Interesting class, but not enough engaging discussion</comment>It's really easy and interesting. You don't need to do any of the reading, and you can still keep up with the class discussion.</comment>This course is arguably the best course Harvard has too offer. Professor Braun is absolutely amazing. Can't recommend it enough.</comment>Very interesting topic, very knowledgable professor</comment>You end up learning very little because it is so disorganized</comment>If you are interested in war and international relations, you would be a fool not to take this class.  Unlike a lot of the liberal, in-the-clouds professors here at Harvard, Professor Braun approaches every issue in IR from a rational, logical, and practical perspective and truly helps you gain a realistic understanding of what is going on in the world today.</comment></course>WOMGEN 1253: Sexual Health and Reproductive Justice</title>TAKE THIS CLASS! This was by far one of the best classes that I have taken at Harvard. Not only was the material and subject matter interesting, but the way through which the class addressed and critiqued it provides an invaluable framework through which to view numerous issues. Professor Agenor is an absolutely incredible teacher who not only generate enthusiasm for the material, but makes what could be an intimidating and not easily accessible subject matter accessible and inviting to people with all different backgrounds and previous knowledge levels. All of the assignments forced me to engage with the material in a thought provoking and productive way.   This class is a amazing and necessary. There should be more classes like this at Harvard.</comment>TAKE THIS CLASS. If it is not offered again after this semester than that would be a huge mistake because it was honestly the best class that I have taken at Harvard without a doubt. The readings were incredible and intersectional and Professor Agenor facilitated AMAZING and thought provoking discussion each class. The work load was manageable and engaging and I would take this class all over again if I could.</comment>This is an awesome class, one of a kind! Dr. Agenor is amazing. She's very accessible and understanding. This is a class will change the way you look at sexual health and the reproductive rights movement.If you're even thinking of taking this class, do it!</comment>Be ready to work, think, and self-critique, but it is SO WORTH IT. This class is amazing and makes you question everything you think you know.</comment>This is a great class. Yes, it is a lot of reading and a lot of work, but if you're interested in the topic it is totally worth it. You think you have a hold on issues of reproductive justice and sexual health? No? Take it. Yes? Also take it (because you actually don't - you'll see). Agenor knows what she is talking about, but definitely does not drown conversations trying to be pedantic. She encourages everyone to talk and succeeds tremendously. You will learn a lot about topics that might not seem to be obviously related - especially about women of color and other marginalized groups. Definitely recommend this class if you're down for dedicating time to the readings.</comment>This class fosters learning about a wide variety of topics in sexual and reproductive health and justice, some of which are widely contested and therefore useful to have knowledge on, and some of which are not even discussed usually but are important nonetheless.</comment>Professor Agenor created a class filled not only with incredible content and rich readings to from for great conversation with a very comprehensive syllabus. She also manages the discussions in an effective manner that allow the conversation to move through various topics, always making sure we cover the content necessary. She has structured each session very well and moves the class through it.</comment>Incredibly eye-opening and useful. I loved preparing for and attending class each week. Prof Agenor is a wonderful teacher. If you have any interest in reproductive rights/justice and some foundational understanding of WGS material, take this class.</comment>Great class! The workload may seem like a lot but it's manageable and very rewarding</comment></course>SAS 199: Modern India Through Narrative Forms</title>Shankar ji is great! Do the readings because they really aid to class discussion. If you don't read then class is more or less pointless. Readings can take a lot of hours so start ahead.</comment>If you want to get a better understanding of Modern India, then this will be the best selection of readings from some of the best novels and short stories you'll ever find.</comment>You read a book every week so make sure you are able to plan your time accordingly. Also make sure you get a copy of the books well ahead of time. I didn't want to buy all of the books, because there are so many, but these books are mostly unknown and very hard to locate. Make sure you have a copy of the book at the beginning of each week so you have time to read it and write a response by the end of the week.</comment></course>HAA 22: The Architectural Imagination</title>This is a philosophy course. Expect the readings to be theoretical and ideological.</comment>This class was very difficult without prior experience in the area. Course material was very abstract and required advanced analysis.</comment>Very difficult and confusing class, but good topic.</comment></course>FRSEMR 39x: Watch Her Step: Ballet Past and Present</title>If you like ballet, it gives you a lot of good watching and reading material. The actual class isn't great, though.</comment>If you don't like ballet, and the idea of having to watch a recorded performance per week doesn't appeal to you, this is not for you. If that does sound fun, it's not too big of a time commitment, and the perspective is interesting.</comment>Lectures were very tedious and not that interesting. Take this if you want a really light workload.</comment>This is an excellent way to learn a lot about ballet if you are enthusiastic about it. The workload is pretty light during the week: the assignments consist mostly of watching ballets, which can take up a few hours, and a few readings.</comment>Take it. You will learn a lot with regards to the growth of ballet. The field trip is so much fun and the fact that is a freshman seminar graded PASS/FAIL means there is less weight on your shoulders.</comment></course>OEB 120: Plants and Climate</title>Take this class if you are strongly interested in plants and physiology. Lectures are fairly disorganized but topics are interesting and assignments allow you to explore areas that interest you the most.</comment>This is an interesting class. Learning from Missy is pretty awesome, because she's a legend in her field. I mean, we did oral exams for our final assignment and we literally sat for an hour answering questions asked by the person who came up with the theories that answer those questions. The course is really quite unstructured and random right now, though, and as far as work goes very back-heavy, with literally no effort required for the first nine weeks of the semester and then a presentation, (long) problem set, and oral exam all at the end. Work wise, definitely recommended. Material-wise...if you have an interest in how plants work, from a mechanical perspective, take this. If you have any question about whether you'd be interested in that, DON'T take this course. It really is a plant physiology class with a minor focus on how climate affects that, not a class in which you're really going to focus on climate change and its global effect on plants. Good class overall, and I came out of it with a much better sense of how plants work.</comment>Prof Holbrook is a a phenomenal resource and her excitement for plant physiology is contagious, yet this course leaves a lot to be desired. This course really lacked structure. There were no set topics, so lectures were flexible, often running over into multiple sessions. It was often hard to follow lectures because background information was skipped, and most lectures jumped right into unintelligible equations and circular discussion without any focus or direction. I wound up teaching myself the material outside of class. It wasn't until a problem set was assigned at the end of the semester that I was really forced to learn the material and make sense of what we were supposed to be learning all along. The final exam was an hour long individual oral exam. It was actually a fun experience and made me realize just how much I had learned. I would recommend this course, with reservations. If you have no interest in plants, you will be sitting there lost, and leaving with two additions at the end of every class: frustration and a headache. If you have any interest in plants, you should take this course-Prof Holbrook is great person and you will learn a lot, or at least feel more comfortable with plant physiology lingo!</comment>Should have some plant background/general interest in plants</comment>This was a very interesting class. At first, I was intimidated since more than half the class was graduate students. However, members of the class grew quite tight, and I am now good friends with many other students from OEB 120. The material covered was very interesting, but a bit confusing at times. However, Professor Holbrook is very willing to take extra time to explain a difficult concept.   The course was a bit disorganized and expectations were not clearly defined at all times. There was very little work in the course except at the end, when we had a final project, a take-home assignment, and a final exam within the span of a week and a half. Speaking of the exam, it was an individual ORAL final exam! This was an awesome way to conclude this class that really assured that I had learned and understood the material!</comment>I would recommend taking this class if you are interested in plant physiology and self-directed in learning the material. This semester, there were no assignments due until the last 2 weeks of class, so there is a danger of falling behind and getting lost because you are not actively interacting with the course material on a weekly basis (like in weekly problem set classes).  There was not as much of an emphasis on the climate change component of the class as on plant physiology. That being said, Prof. Holbrook is a leader in the field and incredibly knowledgable. The project component is a rigorous and fun way to explore a question/aspect that sparks your interest, and having an oral final is an interesting experience</comment>Great course if you're interested in this material. Very interesting to see some of the experiments that go on in plants and climate.</comment>The subject material was interesting (although this is definitely very much a physiology course), and Missy is a fantastic professor. However, since this was the first year it was offered, the structure definitely needs some work– the only 3 assignments in the entire class were due the last 2 weeks. The lectures were also rather disorganized. That being said, the assignments that we did have and the care Missy took to make sure we understood everything left me with a solid understanding of the subject.</comment>It is a good way to learn a lot about plant physiology and can help you add context to any research you do with plants.</comment></course>AFRAMER 90r.p: Xhosa</title>You will learn a lot!</comment>This class is amazing!

Spanish 120 is a fine, nurturing, and fulfilling experience for the student of Spanish at Harvard.</comment>It was a very intimate setting and the professor is very accessible. Great opportunity to deeply explore a single, seminal work in Spanish literature.</comment>There is no way to know better the spanish language.</comment></course>BCS Ar: Elementary Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian</title>This class is a great opportunity to learn BCS in a friendly, supportive setting. Aida is a phenomenal and dedicated instructor, and even though you only meet twice a week, you will learn a ton!</comment></course>EXPOS 20.254: The Science of Emotion</title>Expos is a helpful class that will prepare you for writing other college papers.</comment>I really liked the material taught in this course; overall, it was very valuable and well-taught, though difficult at times. It improved my writing skills and taught me a lot about how emotions are defined, how they influence our thinking, how to think about them, and how to form an analytical psychological argument.</comment>I liked the preceptor a lot. The class in itself and the concepts we covered were not that interesting to me personally though.</comment>As far as expos goes this is definitely one to consider. Expos as a course will never be life changing or awe inspiring. However from what I gather, this is one of the better ones. The work is manageable (fairly light on the reading, as it only requires reading journal articles), interesting (if you're in to psych), and professor tierney is incredibly wise and will really be able to help you with your writing. I highly recommend this class!</comment>It is much better than the other expos' from what I have gathered from other students.</comment>Great class with a fantastic instructor.</comment>Very science-heavy, which can be good if you are deep in the STEM</comment>Felt like this one was relatively difficult but ultimately more rewarding than other Expos classes.</comment>The material taught in this course was very interesting. However, the essay writing was quite a difficult and arduous process.</comment></course>HEB 1418: Endocrinology and Behavior: Research Seminar</title>Workload is very light at the beginning of the semester, but it does ramp up, especially for the final project. I found it incredibly exciting to be able to work with human samples (the subject recruitment phase was fun as well haha), and analyze the data to find original connections. Sample sizes will be small so understand that your research scope will be limited, but this class is a great way to actually work on analyzing data and writing up your findings (sort of a way to test if you want to do a thesis), rather than being a lab slave as an intern in an outside lab. You'll also learn a lot about how to manipulate data and run clinically significant biostatistical tests. Professor Lipson is very accessible and helpful outside of class, and I would definitely recommend talking to her one-on-one to work out any confusing data you might get.  That being said, this class is much more focused on the logistics of research in endocrinology than I expected than on actually learning about recent advancements and discoveries in behavioral endocrinology. To learn more about hormone/behavior relationships, I'd suggest HEB1310!</comment>This class really develops the skills needed to perform research individually.</comment>This course is taught incredibly well, with diligence and enormous attention to detail. My recommendation is to consider how this may be useful in writing a thesis: if you see yourself interested in writing a thesis that considers hormone levels as a variable, this is the way to go for you! The week-to-week workload is light, but the final paper is quite extensive so get a head start and meet with Professor Lipson, who will be instrumental in helping shape your final product. I enjoyed taking this class, and feel like it opened some channels of thought that are inaccessible in other Harvard courses.</comment></course>MODMIDEAST 200a: Approaches to Middle Eastern Studies</title>All incoming AM students have to take it…it really is not an option!</comment></course>PSY 1750: Free Will, Responsibility, and Law</title>This class was a lot of fun. The questions being asked here are fundamental, and you'll really enjoy debating them. You might change your mind on the issues, or simply develop a stronger basis for ideas you may already have; either way it's worth it. Come prepared, and don't be too hesitant to participate; Dr. Greene is always considerate, all the while encouraging to push your reasoning further.</comment>Make sure you are prepared to treat this class as a philosophy class. The first two weeks are extremely interesting, because you discuss criminal law and the insanity defense. After that, though, the course is focused on philosophy debates of free will and determinism. It was not what I expected from the first few classes. Professor Greene is incredible, though, so it is worth it to take just to hear him talk. Just be prepared to think in terms of philosophy and not psychology!</comment>This class is hands down one of the most engaging and incredible classes I've taken at Harvard. Josh Greene is very intelligent and is in a unique position to teach a course like this due to his background in philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, and the law. It might not be offered again, but if it is, you should definitely take it. You learn so much about the legal system, the free will debate, and the psychology/neuroscience behind our actions. Your views on criminal justice and the punishment criminals should receive will be challenged and most likely changed. I personally learned a ton about the free will debate and now feel comfortable discussing both compatibilism and determinism. There are three areas this class covers - the law, philosophy of free will, and psychology of human decision making. You will leave the class with a good amount of knowledge on all three. The class is also heavily discussion based and it helps to have a philosophy background to make insightful comments.</comment>One of the best courses I've taken at Harvard. Josh is incredibly lucid and approaches philosophy in a very down-to-earth way. The topic obviously is fascinating and lies at the core of so many dimensions of our lives. I looked forward to every class.</comment>This is the most amazing class I have taken at Harvard. It not only completely blew my mind, but also changed the way I view the world, human nature and morality. This class will actually knock your socks off. Not only that, Professor Greene is unbelievably hilarious, smart and interesting. If you know what is good for you, try to take this class.</comment>This class should not be under psychology. It is wonderful for a philosophy student, someone who would rather conjecture about the hypothetical possibilities of a situation rather than concrete assimilation or psychological analyses of facts. It was somewhat obvious that Professor Greene picked favorites in this course and would allow them to lead class discussion in whatever way they felt so inclined, regardless of the other opinions or hands up in the room. I regret taking this course.</comment>This class is one of the best I have taken in my time here. If you get the chance to take it, do not miss the opportunity. Professor Greene has put together a great course that really makes you think about your views of the world while learning a great deal at the same time. Don't miss this course if it is offered.</comment>This is an awesome course that discusses a pertinent philosophical issue through a philosophical lens but in the context of modern advances in neuroscience. Really interesting, really thorough, really enlightening.</comment>This class will make you think. It will make the gears in your head turn and that's a good feeling. But it was poorly time managed -- too many student presentations meant that discussions were often cut off prematurely. Also, know that this is more of a philosophy course than a psych course. The issues raised will often be abstract, and students trained in a different discipline may sometimes feel frustrated that all of the texts you read in this class are reduced to "big issues," for example, whether or not we have free will. Sometimes the course feels more like a series of increasingly abstract logic puzzles than an engagement with real-life phenomena. If you study history or English, this may be frustrating to you. In the end, though, I felt that my logical reasoning skills were certainly challenged and, I am sure, strengthened by that.</comment>Professor Greene is fabulous at facilitating class discussions - he always knows what questions to ask, and what holes to poke into people's arguments. Also, this class is a great overview of some of the key issues surrounding the free will debate. I found that as I got more informed, I became more confused. (In a good way.)</comment>Very cool class. The questions it raises are fascinating but frustrating (in a good way).</comment></course>SOCIOL 181: Social Change in Modern Korea</title>Professor Chang is a great lecturer! If you want an overview of Korean history with a focus on understanding the developments that have contributed to the making of Korea as it is today, it's a great class.</comment>Professor Chang is an amazing professor who truly cares about students learning and delving into the material. He truly made this class an open learning environment and brought much of his experience into it which always makes it relevant and important material. The class itself is very useful and provides historical context to better understand the social changes that have happened. It was a very positive learning experience!</comment>This is a great class, definitely take it if you want to have a good introduction to Korean history.</comment>If you have any interest in Korea, this is a great class to take. The normal workload is just readings and the lectures are very engaging.</comment>The organization of the class could use a little fixing.</comment>This is an excellent course for an overview of Korean history.  This is great if you want a refresher or general information, but it's not the course for you if you want details.</comment>I took this class because two of my friends had taken it previously and both said Paul was super chill and a great professor. Definitely glad I took it! They were right, he's a great lecturer that cares about the material and getting students interested in the material. I think he also just relates well with students. The course is well structured and doesn't ask too much from you outside of class, except for the final essay. Even then I ended up writing more than I expected, and I attribute that to Prof. Chang giving useful feedback early on and respect for his class. For my first sociology class, this was great!</comment>Incredible class - one of the best I've taken at Harvard. Lectures are engaging, the exams and the paper are actually quite fun, and the history/social changes of South Korea are fascinating themselves. Prof Chang is fantastic teacher who is accessible, knowledgeable and truly cares about his students.</comment>I cannot recommend this course highly enough. I think it may the best course I've ever taken at Harvard. The workload is more than doable, expectations for assignments are clear, and the lectures and readings are uniformly fascinating.  Professor Chang is very funny and witty, passionate about the subject material, and really cares about his students. If you are debating between taking this or another Korea-related class, TAKE THIS CLASS. You will come out with a great grasp of the changes that modern Korean society has undergone over the past hundred years, and a better idea of where Korea headed. This course reinforced my decision to go into Korean studies after graduation; maybe it will change your life like it changed mine.</comment>this is a wonderful class! Professor Chang is an awesome professor and an engaging lecturer. This was the first class I've ever taken on Asian history/Korea itself, and I was fascinated by what I learned in every single lecture. It's also has a relatively light workload so it's the perfect class to take if you need to balance out your schedule w/ a class in which you can just listen, learn, and appreciate the material :)</comment></course>VES 151br: Nonfiction Video Projects</title>This is one of the best courses at Harvard, but don't take it just to take 1. a film class, 2. help your GPA, or 3. see if film is right for you. No. Take this class if you have a passion for film (either career or just hobby) and if you want your documentary skills to sky rocket. This is an amazing class and you get what you put into it. Filming in the summer is a blast but also not the easiest if you want to produce an amazing film. The work in the summer is not easy or short. It is very time intensive if you want an amazing product. But the result is so great. You truly can balance this class amongst 4-5 courses, but just be aware that it is not an easy course because nothing great and perfect in life comes easy w/o work and effort.</comment>I recommend this course if you want to spend the semester working on a single project. If you are remotely interested in filmmaking, this course is a must-take. There are very few other opportunities where you can devote so much time to a single project, and the value in doing so should not be underrated.</comment>This class is an amazing opportunity work deeply on a project. Make sure to put the work in over the summer in order to make it worthwhile. Both Ross and Lucy really make the class.</comment>This course is amazing - it gives you the opportunity to devote time over summer and edit over the semester. Small setting allows going into the most intricate details. Prepare to spend hours and hours in the editing lab, and a lot in the class on Friday (don't hope for an easy three-day weekend). However, it does not feel like work.</comment></course>STAT 110: Introduction to Probability</title>This is a great class. Really interesting. Just be ready to put in the time. If you respect it, it is totally doable.</comment>This course teaches very useful material that is applicable to a lot of fields and will give you a strong understanding of the material through the problem sets and reviewing for exams. The exams as well as problem sets can be tough but the class is very rewarding.</comment>This class is ridiculously hard. You cannot get psets done outside of office hours and the tests are extremely difficult. It is very rewarding, but extremely hard.</comment>Excellent, decently challenging introduction to statistics and probability. Highly recommended to all majors, especially for computer science.</comment>Too much material, too much work, too difficult, too much expected, too little time. You need a VERY, VERY strong math/proof background. DO NOT take this course as an "intro to probability" or "to explore statistics". This class is for hard-core math/stat people, nothing less. I came in thinking I could waltz my way into the class with an ok math background. I was WRONG. This class is incredibly demanding. For beginners like me, DO NOT take it. You're much better taking Stat 104 or Stat 139, where you will actually learn and retain some knowledge.</comment>I really enjoyed this class. After I got into a rhythm and learned which office hours and sections to go to, I didn't find it that difficult. Definitely befriend TFs! Overall you'll be able to absorb the information better if you go to section earlier in the week and start the problem sets ahead of time. The material definitely speeds up in the second half of the semester, so that's something to watch out for.</comment>A good introduction to probability theory. Two thoughts. 1. In this iteration of the course, we were allowed to take 1 or 2 pages of notes to the midterm and final exams. I used such notes in the midterm and final. But upon reflection, it is clear to me that these notes generally create a sense of intellectual dependence that can actually reduce performance. Think carefully about the seemingly benign act of using notes on the final! 2. The class is challenging but necessary for further work in probability.</comment>Be prepared to be surprised by some results you'll prove by yourself.</comment>This class has been the hardest course I've ever taken, but if you are willing to put in the work, it can be very rewarding.  The resources are there, but you have to make the most of them.  Office hours and sections were key in understanding concepts and homework completion.  Looking back, I wish I could have dedicated more time to the class than I did.</comment>It's a challenging course but you need to make sure you actually understand the work you get done weekly on the psets. It's important to get a lot of practice problems done before the exams because they are not easy and you need to be on your game for those.</comment>Very difficult. Make sure you go to Ryan's sections.</comment>Very difficult course, be prepared to go to office hours and section in order to get a good grade in this class.</comment>A challenging subject - probability - is made interesting, organized, coherent in picking up - the course is very well structured  and organized. Professor Rader is great and engaging in lectures - the material is clarified and lectures are engaging to follow. They say it's one of the most challenging courses at Harvard - but all the resources are given to you so it is not so unpredictable.</comment>Great class. Kevin Rader is a very clear lecturer and accessible through email. Blitzstein's textbook is tremendously well-written, and the online practice problems are very helpful.</comment>Undoubtedly difficult-- be prepared to actually spend significant amounts of time with the material if you want to do well.</comment>Stat 110 lives up to its reputation.  It is definitely one of the hardest classes I have taken at Harvard so far, but unlike some other classes you really get back what you put into the class.  The resources are available- between the textbook, the teaching staff, and the other students in the class- that make each week's incredibly challenging PSet do-able.  If you have time in your schedule to put into this class definitely take it- it is such a satisfying and mind-stretching class.   Furthermore being with a self-selected group of students also makes this class fairly social and working on PSets a little more fun.</comment>Hard class that ll probably not be the best for your GPA but worth it to learn the basics of probability.</comment>It's incredibly difficult. Go to section.</comment>Wonderful course and persuaded me to concentrate in Stat.</comment>It's hard.</comment>Very useful class! Professor Rader is super nice and approachable!</comment>This class is really hard. I would definitely recommend reviewing material periodically throughout the semester so studying at the end isn't completely overwhelming (although it probably will be anyway). Definitely also do as many practice problems as possible to build intuition. And also find a great TF like Ryan Lee , and he will be your savior.</comment>This is hard, but rewarding.  You will spend a lot of time in office hours working on problem sets.  You get out of this class what you put into it, in terms of both grade and the experience. It is by far the most difficult class I have taken at Harvard.</comment>Stat 110 is an incredible class! It is very well taught and organized, and the teaching staff is there to help you succeed. While the material is definitely difficult, it's pretty fun and widely applicable! The problem sets are fair and the exams are too. A tough class, but fair and worth it. You will learn a lot!</comment>1) Unless you have previous statistics knowledge, don't take this class. The material is very hard
2) Exams are IMPOSSIBLE. Median was a 59 on the second exam
3) Problem sets generally take about 5 - 10 hours
4) While hard, material is generally really interesting. DEFINITELY BUY AND READ THE TEXTBOOK REGARDLESS OF WHAT PEOPLE SAY. TRUST ME ON THIS</comment>This is a great class, but it is incredibly difficult, especially when it comes to exams. Kevin is a good lecturer, but it can sometimes be hard to pay attention for the full 1.5 hours, especially in Sanders theater. Make sure you find people to do the pset with, otherwise the class would be impossible.</comment>Stat 110 will grind you. The lectures and book are fast. The content is waaay to broad to cover in one semester. But the joy of surviving it knows no bounds. The professors are great. If Joe Blitzstein's Stat 110 had pizzazz, Kevin Rader's has chutzpah, sisu (google it). In Archilochus archetypes immortalized by Isaiah Berlin, one is a hedgehog, the other a fox. Yes,  Multa novit vulpes, verum echinus unum magnum, but what about the lightness of not taking one's self too seriously? What about meta-cognition?  What about the importance of midstream-of-consciousness adjustments when one thinks the work has gone too far in any single direction? Reification leads only to quibbling. So let us dispense with these neat logical categories. The course is great. You should take it.</comment>This class is super cool. If you appreciate the beauty of probability, you will love this class.</comment>be prepared to be myopic</comment>I can now (with a pretty poor confidence interval) say that I know how to model my time spent in this course: as a survival function that is doomed to failure. It is evident that there is a very large variance between the professor's expectation of students, and the realm of normal possibility. I felt that both the problem sets and (especially) the exams were uncorrelated to what was covered in lecture. But alas, life goes on like a continuous Cauchy distribution: I must ignore the moments of stat failure this semester, pretend that my GPA is unknown, and reflect on all the theoretical potential I now possess,|given the knowledge that I have acquired from this course.</comment>Stat 110 is a great class. For students who are interested in math and science fields, Stat 110 will be fairly easy and fun, as the problem sets don't take too long. In particular, with a good math background, Stat 110 is a light class with problems that are at times reminiscent of high school math contests.</comment>This class is more demanding than your girlfriend!</comment>Stat 110 is a great course. It's well set up so even though it's difficult, it's tough to fall behind if you use the support system of OHs, etc. Rader did an excellent job filling in and as a result of taking this class, I'm now concentrating in Stat.</comment>Stat 110 is a useful class that gives you really useful new ways to think about the world. It's very difficult, though, and a lot of work to wrap your head around.</comment>Great class, must take.</comment>I have PTSD now</comment>The way to succeed is to keep up with the material and understand how it fits together in the big picture. I don't think I really saw that until I started studying for the final, which made doing each pset just a grind of getting through it. Office hours are extremely useful for psets. Exams are difficult--the average for midterm was a 64 and final was a 58, but there should be an okay curve. It's not impossible to do well in the course, though it is challenging.</comment>I really liked Stat 110! As a CS and Math concentrator, I really enjoyed the mathematical aspect of Stat 110. The problems on the homework were challenging, but they're doable and the sense of reward from solving the is great!</comment>if you think you're smart, take this course. if you think you're average, just no.</comment>This class earns its rep as one of the more difficult courses on campus. Problem sets are usually 4-6 problems long, and, if working alone, can easily take upwards of 10 hours to complete. Tests are very difficult, but the class is curved. The curve, however, is is a rough one. ~35% A/A- for a class where the most academic students take the class as well as grad students that tend to have a lighter workload. Just something to be aware of, especially since this is not common for most classes here.</comment>Great class.  The secret to this class might actually be the textbook.  It's a really incredible textbook that explains everything clearly, succinctly, with good connections and examples.  Also if you do the problem sets yourself (and then check with other people) but actually try to do every problem on your own, you will definitely get the grade you want. Don't fall behind!</comment>Stat 110 provides a fairly comprehensive but not overwhelming of probability, and will give you a very solid foundation in how to think about probability problems that show up in the real world. I'm not sure how it is with Blitzstein in comparison; but this year, the workload was substantial (problem sets are definitely time-consuming) but definitely not overwhelming. Take the class if you are willing to challenge yourself to learn a lot about an important area.</comment>Stat 110 is a great class and the material is super useful for future courses in a wide variety of areas. Under Kevin Rader, the course wasn't as exciting, but expect it to be better under Blizstein or if Kevin teaches it again since he will have more experience</comment>I hated every second of this class. 
Lectures were snoozeville.
Psets were exceedingly difficult. 
Exams made people cry. 
This was probably because they assumed a level of mastery that the tf's and professor admitted they didn't have, and seemed to favor luck and brilliance over actual knowledge of the material.</comment>Stat 110 was definitely an enjoyable but very challenging course and you should go into the class knowing that you will be putting quite a bit of work into it. Use your resources (sections are great, especially Theresa's and Ryan's), as well as the book (read it before/ after lecture!) and you should be okay. I feel like the exams were difficult to study with (I wish there were more intermediate practice problems) but if you're willing to put a lot of time into it, you'll be okay!</comment>It's a hard course, but once you get out of it, you definitely feel like you've learned a lot.</comment>This class was unreasonably hard. It is incredibly unfortunate that we did not get to have the usual professor, Joe Blitzstein. Kevin Rader was a poor choice for a replacement. Kevin somehow turned a theoretical class into an applied class, which is sort of impossible given the subject. Kevin's lectures were absolutely awful and unhelpful. If it weren't for Joe's textbook, I don't think I would know a single thing about probability. It often seemed like Kevin himself didn't even understand the theory behind probability. One TF who really picked up Kevin's slack was Ryan Lee. Ryan's sections were so well-attended (And with good reason! Ryan actually taught us the material that we never learned elsewhere) that they had to be held in a lecture hall. If that's not a sign that this class has major problems, I don't know what is. The problem sets were also unreasonably difficult. Kevin even said that they were meant to be too difficult to do alone without TF help. That seems absurd! We're not really learning the material if we have to ask TFs to walk us through the problem sets each week. Kevin also did not give the TFs solutions to the problem sets, so two different TFs could lead you to two very different problem set answers. The exams were also ridiculously challenging and demoralizing. Especially because we couldn't solve the problem sets on our own, doing an exam on our own was incredibly difficult. This was one of the most brutal experiences I have ever had at Harvard. Somehow I still plan to concentrate in Statistics even after this disaster of a class (a decision that is based on the other classes I have taken in the department, which have been much, much better), but I now never want to take another class based on probability or randomness. Perhaps this class is better with Joe Blitzstein at the helm. But with Kevin Rader teaching this class, this is definitely a class you should run far, far away from. Unless you are a stat concentrator... in which case I am so, so sorry for the suffering you're about to endure.</comment>It's so fundamental to so many other courses + is one of the few courses that introduces a completely new way of thinking</comment>It's one of the toughest courses at Harvard. Do not underestimate the amount of work, commitment, or stress this class will give you. If you can take an easier course instead, take it. If you do take it, make sure you understand the material that is taught each week--once you fall behind, it's going to be exceedingly difficult to come back. Collaborate with others.</comment>This is a great course that really teaches you a lot about statistics. If you plan on being a statistics concentrator, I highly recommend this class and it will teach you a lot o how to think critically and solve problems.</comment>Really hard course but worth the effort. Material is incredibly applicable and is presented in a reasonably coherent way. Fall 2014 was Rader and people say Blitzstein is a lot better and makes a big difference. Other students are very strong academically so the curve isn't particularly good. Lots of grad students. Be ready to spend 10-15 hrs on the psets.</comment>Stat 110 is hard. You learn a lot of material, but don't really get to see how it is applied, which is part of what makes it hard.</comment>I wouldn't take it unless absolutely necessary as you don't learn the applications of the math.</comment>Be prepared to work hard, with very difficult exams.</comment>This class is extremely difficult, and sometimes it feels a little like death. If you stick with it, though, it's extremely rewarding. If you're at all considering concentrating in stats, I definitely recommend it!</comment>You need to put in effort.</comment>Stat 110 is not as hard as people play it out to be -- the material is not so difficult. However, it is extremely difficult to get an A in the class though; up to a certain point, studying for midterms doesn't really help because solving problems correctly relies more on intuition / innate ability than hard work.</comment>The concepts covered in the class are very intuitive, so no one should be intimidated by lack of background knowledge or experience in statistics.</comment>Very difficult but rewarding.</comment>It would have been more efficient to learn the material myself. The material is not so difficult to grasp, and if you only need this as a pre-req for other courses, I don't think the time investment is worth it. The problem sets are the most useful element of the course. Lectures are very slow and relatively boring.</comment>One of the best courses I ever had. The topics of the course are not that hard, but problem sets make you really think about the concepts. Go to Ryan's sections/OH if he is TF next year again. He was an excellent TF and his sections / handouts helped a lot to do well in exams. This class really changed my way to think about probability. Great c</comment>The HW mean is surprisingly high given the terrible exam mean, so make sure your HW scores are perfect if you want to stay ahead of the curve. The exam mean hovers around a 60-65, so you only need bout an 80 on both to get an A. Do the strategic practice every week until you see the patterns necessary to answer exam problems quickly. Remember your stories and your symmetries.</comment>Great course, especially for CS concentrators (lots of concepts creep up in CS classes). Definitely expect to be challenged. However, if you're comfortable with math, you should be fine. The course really wants you to succeed. Plenty of helpful resources and TFs. Kevin is awesome and really approachable. I wouldn't recommend this to someone looking for a practical stats course. Although this has that, it focuses more on the mathy side to probability and such. I'd take Stat 104 instead if you want that. Overall, I enjoyed this course!</comment>Not a great class. Take only if necessary for concentration.</comment>It was an informative class.</comment>Stat 110 is a great class – really interesting material that challenges you to think outside the box. The course will take up a significant amount of time, and the exams are really hard, but in the end I think the course is worth taking because probability is such an interesting subject.</comment>Stat110 is incredibly difficult but the class material is really cool.</comment>Very worthwhile course for those who feel like they need probability.</comment>This is an extremely rewarding class to any students (particularly those entering quantitative research fields) who want to deeply understand the mechanics which underlie all statistical processes. It will contribute to a much deeper understanding of the methods you'll use every day, and help you diagnose many issues you'll encounter in your work. 

If you have the option, take the class Pass/Fail. This is from both personal experience and a healthy dose of hearsay, but cheating is widespread in the class, from trading solutions to homework problems, manipulating teaching fellows, using online and in-person expert resources (paid or otherwise) to get answers, to much more insidious issues – during exams, restrooms are full of students on their smartphones, students often exceed the "cheat sheet" limits, bringing three or four pages of notes in... probably worst of all, I overheard several people entering the final exam saying to one another "So who are you taking this for?" and discussing the students who had paid them to sit the exam. Attendance slips do nothing to stop this. 

This would be pretty much par for the course if it weren't that the class is graded on a curve. You'll be competing with such a shocking lack of academic integrity for your grade. Save yourself the trouble, avoid this competition, and take it pass/fail.</comment>Difficult class, but well worth it! Some incredibly important topics are introduced, which have relevance to any field dealing with data at all. You will need the intuitions given in this class to make effective and proper judgments with regards to data.</comment>This course is difficult, but rewarding.</comment>You will struggle for the whole semester with this course, from the complex and fast-paced lectures to the arduous homework. Expect to have some late nights putting the finishing touches on homework. And be prepared to think harder than you may have before about the intuition behind problems. Overall, this ends up being more of a math course than a stats course. But in the end, you should be able to understand how the concepts relate and you will be amazed at the amount of knowledge that you have acquired.</comment>It is not as difficult as people make it out to be. Getting high grades on the psets and exams are just a matter of being willing to do a bit of extra work, looking up ideas and concepts that you do not understand, and going over carefully previous years' materials. Kevi's version of the course is also a lot easier than Joe's.</comment>This is a great class, and you definitely learn a lot.  For those not math/statistics inclined, it will definitely be rather challenging.  The problem sets can be tough and the midterm and final are brutal (don't worry though, the curve is generous).  If you like math/statistics though this class really isn't that bad.  You learn a lot and the work load is reasonable.  There's also more than enough resources if you need help.</comment>Stat 110 is the quintessential course to take if you're considering a concentration or secondary in Statistics. It covers a lot of bases and is a very thorough and comprehensive primer to probability. I enjoyed it very much!</comment>This is a really difficult course.  There is just so much material that you will learn and the coursework is tricky.  The homeworks take around 10 hours a week and to actually get the material, probably a few more hours.  If you are a person that is comfortable with math, this class should not be too bad but take only if your courseload isn't too bad already.</comment>Do everything you can to not take this class. It is poorly taught and the material is too hard to learn on your own. The tests test material that you haven't learned. Lectures are useless and boring. This class is impossible and there is no support system in the class to help you. DONT TAKE THIS CLASS.</comment>Stat 110 is a quintessential Harvard class.  Not only are the types of questions asked and answered in stat 110 interesting, but there are interesting applications that are seen even in problem sets.  While some lectures this year were somewhat unorganized, Kevin was a great professor, and I hear it's even better with Blitzstein.

TLDR: If Blitzstein is teaching this course, you basically have to take it.  If anyone else is taking it, I still strongly recommend taking it at some point, especially if you can count it for some sort of requirement.</comment>If you've done math club-type things in high school, it makes the beginning of this course (the probability part) easier, although I've definitely seen people be able to manage without any background. Very few things were that abstract or difficult conceptually, and while the examples make sense if you go to class, there were occasionally a few concepts that I didn't think were super clear from lecture. In those cases, though, it wasn't impossible to learn that on my own from reading the textbook. 

I think the hardest part was that the solutions to the problems make sense once you see it, but it can be really challenging to come up with it on your own. Except for a select few people, though, most of the class is in the same shoes as you, which created an environment that I really liked as we all struggled together. 

Kevin wasn't always the best at answering questions in a simple, understandable way, but the TF's and textbook tend to be pretty good for that. Office hours also tend to be pretty packed, so it helps to take it with a group of people you can also ask for help--or befriend people!</comment>If you're interested in statistics, definitely take this class. If not, you should probably be a bit wary -- it's not a walk in the park. Still worth taking.</comment>Stat110 is definitely one of the most difficult classes at Harvard, but if you're willing to work hard and put in A LOT of time, you're going to learn a lot and will be proud of yourself at the end of the semester for having survived such a difficult course.</comment>Stat 110 is a great class to take if you want to learn a lot about probabilities and how the world runs with them. It will get you to think about the world in a different way. I think everyone should take a stat class sometime in college!</comment>Stat 110 is a necessary evil. It's a required course for statistics concentrators and it is not easy--in fact, the statistics department prides itself on offering "one of the hardest classes at Harvard." Be prepared for many long hours devoted to problem sets and many, many stressful evenings.</comment>take it, be ready to work hard, and rely on the book because it's great</comment>This course is very tough, use office hours and groups to work through the psets.</comment>While this class is very difficult at times, it is nevertheless a worthwhile and engaging exploration of probability theory. With a great teaching staff and numerous office hours and sections, the class is good at providing you with the support you need. At times the problem sets did not feel as helpful for exam preparation as might be desirable, but that was not a real problem; the class is overall quite good.</comment>i would like to tell them that this course is ridiculously difficult, but filled with interesting material.</comment>Stat is a good thing to learn, or so they tell me, and this class is a solid place to start if you're somewhat math-y. Not spectacular, but gets the job done. You'll learn probability, and a swath of distributions, and some basic tools to analyze them. All about the nuts and bolts.</comment>Not sure if this was a bad course, or if I was just always bored by it. Math was tedious, and the concepts were interesting but always tested in boring ways.</comment>The material you learn in Stat 110 is extremely interesting and very applicable. I strongly recommend taking this class – it'll be helpful in almost any discipline and gives you the skills to look analytically at any real-world problem involving probability.

While the teaching this year left something to be desired, I still think this is an awesome class that anyone capable should take.</comment>This class is kind of hard.</comment>don't underestimate it. it gets hard fast.</comment>This class was really interesting, but without a doubt the most challenging course I've ever taken in my life. Study for the final and midterm in advance.</comment>The way this course was taught this semester was probably an anomaly, since Blitzstein will be teaching Stat 110 next year. The material was interesting, and I felt like I learned a decent amount, but the lectures and the homework felt more like busy work. I often spent more time trying to evaluate an integral correctly than setting up the problem/applying the relevant statistical concepts. Moreover, while the first third of the course was taught with story proofs, the last two thirds of the course taught material in (what felt like) a less elegant way. I never went to section, but I went to office hours a couple times, and the TFs were very helpful with clearing up any areas of confusion. Other supplemental material (extra practice problems, practice midterms, and practice exams) were available. In general, though, this course wasn't difficult. I'd recommend taking this course (especially since it's a prereq for so many classes), but I didn't get as much out of it as I'd hoped.</comment>I took it as a stat requirement. If you're not taking this as a requirement, then I guess I would still recommend this class because it teaches you a new way to think about things, and it's just super useful. I had a job interview for a data science position that they basically asked me two stat 110 questions. It is really hard though and will probably drop my gpa because I did sooooo horribly on the first midterm. Also, Kevin's lectures are okay... but I basically learned everything from the textbook.</comment>It is an extremely difficult course but overall worth the experience.</comment>Worth it, but you'll have to work hard (and mostly, CONSISTENTLY) for things to actually sink in.</comment>It definitely takes a lot of collaboration and hours of TF office hours.</comment>This class is extremely difficult but also extremely rewarding.</comment>There's no other course like it. If you need an introduction to probability, take this. It's hard conceptually, but you'll be grateful in the end. And the work load isn't that bad.</comment>Heavy engagement with exceptional topics for those who enjoy Statistics.</comment>Prepared to put in so much time and effort, but regardless if the grade is what you wanted, you definitely will take something away from this course.</comment>This is a good class that covers a lot of important material.</comment>This class is definitely hard. It is challenging. It will keep you up at night until the point that you regret taking this class. But, after the final is over, you will be very happy that you decided to take this class. It makes you think in a very different way about statistics, as it is taught in a more theoretical manner. This course will definitely expand your problem solving ability. It is 100% one of the best courses I have taken at Harvard.</comment>We cover all sorts of concepts and keeping track of them can be tough, but it was definitely worth it for me.</comment>The class is very difficult but very rewarding. Be prepared to spend a lot of time in office hours, especially in the second half of the semester. I made the mistake of taking this class a freshman, and I'm glad I did now that it's over, but I'd recommend you wait until your sophomore year.</comment>The class is incredibly demanding but very rewarding at the same time. If you're a math or stat oriented student you will likely really enjoy the class, but be prepared to put in a lot of hours on psets and studying for exams. Most difficult class I've taken thus far but incredibly interesting material and a very worthwhile experience.</comment>I can't speak for the class with Blitzstein, but Rader did a good job filling in. Lectures often had tedious components (deriving the CLT was definitely one of them) but were engaging for the most part. Problem sets are difficult but didn't take as long as I had expected (5-10 hours/week instead of 15-20). Grading is fair, mean score is around a B+.</comment>This iteration was not as good as previous ones - I don't feel like I actually understood the material at a deep level. If Rader is teaching, maybe hold off. Blitzstein is worth waiting for.</comment>Learn a lot, but very difficult.</comment>Take this class! It's very rewarding.</comment>Stat110 was nearly everything that it was said to be. It's a hard class with alot to offer. Even if Joe wasn't teaching it this year, it certainly wasn't easy or shallow. Its a good course: highly recommend for those who may be interested in some statistical theory.</comment>This is a very difficult course which may hurt your gpa but you will learn a lot and in the end it can be very rewarding.</comment>It's not as hard as people make it out to be. If you approach each problem with the mindset that it's not that hard, the class is not that hard. It's easy to psych yourself out though, because often the answers don't come to mind immediately.</comment>This class is tough, so make sure you develop some kind of support group. Go to office hours as much as possible and work with friends. If you try to do go it alone you will be lost.</comment>Stat 100 is one of rare classes that is both extremely challenging and worth the work. It'll be even better with Joe Blitzstein teaching it. Take it.</comment>This class is quite difficult, but it is also quite helpful in gaining a further understanding of probability.  Probability, in my opinion, is one of the hardest part of statistics, and this class enables students to focus on just that aspect for the entire semester.</comment>This is a challenging class, and doing more practice problems is rewarding.</comment>This is a great class on probability and would definitely change how you think. The materials are hard but you will be able to master them through doing a lot of practice problems.</comment>If you like puzzles, this is a fun course.</comment>Stat 110 is an incredible class that teaches you really cool things about probability. You cover some cool problems that are fun brain-teasers and teach cool concepts, but a lot of the class is also going to be technical problems, like proving relationships among different distributions.
You're also going to be spending a ton of time in office hours. Being in a class where you simply cannot figure out the problems on your own and need office hours is depressing at times, but at least you learn a lot of good material.
This is a class that really takes work and practice, though. Every day you should be doing one or two problems (this only has to be 5 minutes!) so that you're not cramming in material the few days before the midterm and final.
Re: difficulty:
For the average Harvard student who did Calc BC in high school, this class will be intermediate to hard and taking another pset class or two during the same semester will be fine. For people who didn't, this class will be your hardest class. (And for full-on math people, this class will be a fun stroll in the park.) I definitely recommend this class regardless of your background.</comment>This course is so useful!  While exams and assignments (particularly the midterm) may be challenging, the material is overall not too hard to understand, and will give a good background understanding of probability/stat for related fields (I took it alongside a stat-based chem course and it helped a lot).  Reading the textbook (Blitzstein) isn't mandated, but is very helpful if you'd like to make significant headway on the problem sets earlier than the day before they're due.  Course is large</comment>This is the hardest, most rewarding class I have taken at Harvard so far. It challenged my intuitions and taught me to think about probability in a much more nuanced way. Not for the faint of heart though, it takes a lot of time -- get problem sets done early and come to office hours; expect about 15 hours a week + class time.</comment>what a hard class...very very important, but oh so hard. youll think you understand how to do a problem, then see 0/6 on the midterm you get back.</comment>Probably best to take it when Blitzstein is teaching it.</comment>Take the class! You approach problems differently than any usual math class taken, which I really appreciate in this class. The psets help solidify the content, though the sometimes didn't sync with the lectures well, so you'd occasionally have problems that required concepts during Thursday's lecture, even though it's due less than 24 hours from then.</comment>This was not a particularly fun course to take. The material is amazing, but the poor teaching and poor assignments made it a lot less fun than I had heard from previous students. If Blitzstein is teaching the course, take it; I was told this was a life changing course. It was not.</comment>This class was fairly frustrating. Lecture was spent doing derivations that were difficult to follow and very uninteresting. On top of that, homework was near impossible without handholding from TFs, which made it very difficult to actually learn the material. The topics are interesting, but this course could use some changes to how the lectures and homework is structured.</comment>This class is difficult, but very rewarding.  You will learn to really struggle with problems, but with time, you learn how to solve them yourself.  The absolute best things you can do are collaborate with your peers and GO TO OFFICE HOURS.</comment>Mind-numbingly hard and not that gratifying. Every week, you'd think, "The hype must be real. This must all pay off with some golden lecture that links everything," and it never really happens. Your mind will not be blown, but your Thursday nights will be.</comment>If you are going to take it, definitely try to take it with friends.</comment>the course itself is great, fascinating material and useful in many subjects.  probability is weird and ubiquitous.  
re: difficulty level, be prepared to work.  the psets require thinking through difficult logical and mathematical problems - plug'n'chug won't get you very far in this course.  
the instructor this semester, kevin rader, was pretty terrible - careless, defensive, insecure, no teaching presence, and low on empathy.  fortunately, he was only a stand-in for the regular instructor, who was on sabbatical this year.  but on the off-chance he ends up teaching this course again, you're probably better just following the lectures and notes online from previous years.</comment>it's required for a master's degree in statistics</comment>Took it as freshman. If you have a math background it is not as hard as people say.</comment>It's tough. Be committed to learning the material.</comment>This is a tough class that makes you think about probability theory. If you are interested in probability theory, distributions, and other such things, take this. If you are satisfying an economics requirement, don't: take stat 104.</comment>Everything they said is probably true. Very difficult but very rewarding. Don't expect to tackle p-sets alone. I usually do all of my work individually, but if you want to do well in this class, there is no way around finding a good group of people to work with. Although it's not mandatory, I'd recommend buying the book. I made the mistake of barely using it until I started studying during reading period, but that's when I realized how much it really helps. It goes through a lot of the examples that were slightly unclear in lecture. Probably wouldn't recommend the class to someone who's not getting some sort of degree in stats because of its difficulty, but it definitely can be worth the struggle if you put the work in.</comment>It's hard to say if I would recommend this class; I certainly wouldn't if Kevin Rader is teaching it again. He didn't actually seem to understand the more theoretical aspect. At the very least, he didn't do a good job explaining it to us.</comment>This class is really hard, but if you really put work into it, it is extremely rewarding. That said, be prepared to be really challenged and ready to put in the work. Otherwise, it could very well be a very unenjoyable course.</comment>Unless it is imperative that you take this course, don't. It is a weed out class at it's finest.</comment>For someone who has never done competitive math or is used to brain teaser questions, this class can be very challenging. You have to know all the tricks and how to apply them. Practice really helps and there are a lot of resources but it always ends up being the case that you don't have enough time to go through all the practice problems. Make time for this class if you want to take it and feel that you don't have a strong background.</comment>Get used to tricky questions, thinking between the lines beyond intro math courses</comment>TAKE THIS COURSE! It's going to be hard but it's also going to be rewarding. Also, go to section and do the strategic practice problems every week. You can't afford to only really understand everything a few days before the exams.</comment>Be prepared to be challenged, just be persistent and try to keep up with the materials each week, the class can go very fast and cover lots of materials.</comment>this class is very difficult but if you put in effort and do problem sets in advance you can SURVIVE and learn a lot.</comment>Exams are very difficult, but homework is manageable in a collaborative setting. You certainly learn a lot, and you'll probably appreciate the skills you learn later in life, but don't expect a necessary life-changing experience in lectures and sections. It's simply a great and challenging course.</comment>This class is extremely hard, but you can learn a lot from it. Take it during a semester where you have relatively easy classes so you can dedicate a lot of time to it. Definitely go to office hours and don't wait until the last minute to start the homework.</comment>It's difficult. Homework is impossible to do alone. Exams require a lot of studying. Brace yourself.</comment>This class is no cake walk but is definitely worth it.  Go to kevin's OH to get help and get to know him.  You will do poorly, but so will everybody so in the end you're fine</comment>If you are prepared for this course, you will enjoy it. Don't think, however, that you will be able to excel in this class without reaching out to TFs and putting in the time.</comment>Great class - know what you're getting yourself into, it's definitely a lot of work and exams are very hard, but it is definitely manageable and worth the effort</comment>Don't take it unless you really enjoy statistics and want to take a class that will challenge you to think in a more profound way.  However, if you are interested in stat and enjoy that kind of subject material, it is a fantastic class and READ THE BOOK.</comment>Unless you are a Stat, CS, math, or applied math concentrator, I don't recommend taking this course due to how much work is necessary.  The problem sets take a lot of effort and time and the midterm and final are very challenging.  As somebody who has loved math my whole life, I struggled in this course and thought that the lectures should have been more about demonstrating how to think about solving problems and why some of the main concepts were important instead of just focusing on algebra and proofs.</comment>This was a challenging class and many hours were spent in office hours trying to figure out the problem sets. I recommend getting a tutor from BSC ASAP because they're hard to come by, even if you're not going to necessarily use your tutor every week. Pretty challenging, but also pretty interesting material.</comment>Most definitely not an easy class.</comment>Watch out. If Blitztein isn't back, you might be in for a rough one on the exam -- meaning that studying previous exams will likely not help you at all.</comment>Very well-run and well-taught class, even without Blitzstein. Rader did a good job. My math background was higher than most of the class (Math 25, USA(J)MO, etc.), so I found the course easy and not time consuming. Still useful though for sure.</comment>This course is a great introduction to the theory behind much of statistics, and it provides a useful way of thinking about probability. However, as a graduate student, I think I could have learned the important details by just buying Joe Blitzstein's book and/or watching his lectures on Youtube. The problem sets and exams certainly reinforce essential concepts, but if you just want a basic understanding of the ideas underlying statistics, they aren't necessary.</comment>It's tough but interesting</comment>STAT110 is a challenging but rewarding course. As a detailed examination of probability distributions, their behaviors, relatedness, and relationships with real-world problems, the course provides both immediately useful knowledge deployable in analysis, and a strong foundation from which to move confidently into more advanced statistical subjects. In particular, STAT110 helps to break down the assumptions underlying the use of different probability distubutions for various statistical processes.</comment>This class is rewarding once you get through it, but there are definitely times where I became exceedingly frustrated with the difficulty of the course. Be prepared to work very hard.</comment>This is a very difficult course but the material is extremely useful in everyday life and outside the classroom. Almost anything you do in life can benefit from a background in statistics.</comment>Great class!</comment>Be prepared to work hard, know when to ask questions</comment>Good class, standard large lecture format.</comment>My life became centered around work for this class. :( Do not take this without prior statistic knowledge OR the required math requirement, or material will be unnecessarily more difficult. The psets are extremely hard (GO TO OFFICE HOURS) where the TFs will be super helpful. It's hard to feel like you learned a lot if you can't do the psets, but you definitely go through a TON of material. Do not fall behind in this class and make sure you understand everything from the beginning. Say goodbye to Thursday night social life unless you're really disciplined/on top of your work.</comment>This class is extremely difficult, make sure you have the time and passion to take it seriously</comment>Definitely, definitely take this class. It's really cool to think about how distributions can be applied to daily life things, such as how often a bus stops at a bus stop. Be prepared to study for it, but it's really an enjoyable class.</comment>This class has some very interesting material, but is definitely challenging. It is not very well taught, either, so you might need to put in the extra work on your own in order to really learn the material.</comment></course>NEP 103a: Advanced Nepali</title>Take this class if you are interested in the literature and culture of Nepal. You will be able to focus on your literary interests because B.K. Rana will encourage you and help you with many resources.</comment></course>AFRAMER 90r.x: Setswana</title>This is a great class to take if you want to learn Setswana, and the Tswana people.</comment>It is a really good class.</comment></course>MUSIC 15hfr: Harvard Glee Club</title>The Glee Club is an amazing family.</comment>Do HGC!</comment>The Harvard Glee Club is a wonderful opportunity; it is the club I am the most happy about joining since freshman fall. It is a great social group, but with the purpose of making music. The abundance of wonderful performances makes the work in rehearsals all worth it. If you want to make music with others, it's a golden opportunity.</comment>I highly recommend joining Glee Club. We welcome singers of all backgrounds, we have a great sense of community, and we produce beautiful music. You'll make lots of friends and learn music for free. All you need to join Glee Club is the courage to audition and the ability to sing in tune -- Glee Club will take care of the rest. If you're a weak sight-singer/music-reader, Glee Club will pair you with someone more experienced on the seating chart, which allows you to follow along with your part. Warnings: it's a significant commitment of 4 hours (for Glee Club itself) and 8 hours (including Glee Club Lite, the a cappella subset of Glee Club).</comment>Glee club is awesome!</comment>Put in practice time outside of class. It really does benefit the entire Glee Club.</comment>Glee Club is a lot of fun!  Even if you do not have the most singing/musical experience in the world, I recommend you audition.  I have improved so much as a singer and musician, and it was one of the best decisions I made as a freshman this year.</comment>Glee Club is awesome! We sing great music.</comment>Being enrolled in the course hasn't changed my HGC experience at all, except that it will almost undoubtedly open up room for me to take a three-course semester sometime later, which will be very helpful if I write a thesis.  Joining the Glee Club last year is the best extracurricular decision I've made so far in college.</comment></course>ENG-SCI 165: Water Engineering</title>Chad is an awesome professor, and this course is good. The psets were a little annoying, but it's a fun course, and the final project is an awesome opportunity to really do something. The course gives students a lot of respect and freedom-- I felt we were treated like engineers, not like little undergraduate students.</comment>This course was a joke. I came into it hoping it would be an interesting elective outside of my field of study, but it was not rigorous at all. This course only assumes high school level of chemistry and no environmental science background. If you have a decent mathematical background, then it will be very easy, as problem sets and midterm are just plug-and-chug problems with formulas easily found inside the book. I guess if you're in environmental/water engineering, then you need to know the material, but it doesn't present enough material to warrant it as an interesting elective. Final project was also very disorganized. There was absolutely no direction, so many projects were only marginally related to the class material and did not reinforce what was taught.</comment>the p sets are SO hard.</comment>The class is not too much work. There is only one midterm that wasn't too bad. Chad's t-shirt game is off the charts</comment>I think the material in this class is important, but the class is what you make of it. The work does not require a lot from you, but since the class doesn't give you a very deep understanding of anything you really will gain the most by reading the textbook. Otherwise, you'll probably do well in this class but you might feel like it's a waste.   Also, think about final project topics well in advance! If you have an exciting project, you'll really enjoy those hours spent in lab and have something cool to write up.</comment>Pay attention and ask questions and this class will be very manageable. Chad is easygoing and approachable, and he makes an effort to avoid always lecturing the whole time, which makes it almost fun. Also nice to have an intimately sized course.</comment>Great course. Much more in depth than ES 6, but similar material.</comment>This class is good but it repeats a lot of things that are taught in ES 6 and almost any other ESE class. It was not a tough work load and the variable lab and homework helps keep each week with only one assignment. If you are looking to learn a variety of things and are ESE I would recommend taking a different class because this material is covers a lot in ES 6 and the level of difficulty is not that much more. It is interesting and not hard so if you just want to learn more about remediation take it.</comment></course>FRSEMR 21y: The Art and Politics of Science</title>This class is a fantastic, thought-provoking class that will get you very excited about the scientific process. The assignments take time, but everything is interesting and the work will never overwhelm you--even the projects are a labor of love. Dr. Kolter is a fascinating person and very passionate about his work, which is reflected in the great lectures and discussions he holds.</comment>Professor Kolter was unable to be in class several times due to previously scheduled events. This seemed weird to me early on, but I realized he made the course work very well since we watched movies or went to the museum when he wasn't around to moderate discussion. I feel like I have grown from taking this course, and wouldn't change my decision to be part of it.</comment>The material in this seminar was slightly scattered but all was interesting! And Dr. Kolter made us a very nice dinner at his house.</comment>An interesting seminar with not a lot of work. The projects can be fantastic if you apply yourself, the two books you read are interesting, and the movies are entertaining. Overall, not a lot of effort required but still a fun way to spend two hours a week.</comment>This class is no work, stress free, and a waste of your time.</comment>The course is somewhat interesting and very low stress. If you're interested in scientific discovery and the people behind discoveries than you will likely find it enjoyable. The reading and assignments are unbelievably manageable.</comment></course>HIST 1619: Premodern Vietnam</title>Pay attention in class--very useful for the essays</comment>Learn a lot about a history that isn't covered in traditional history classes.</comment>Excellent class to take as an elective if you're interested in history or for your concentration requirement. I took as an elective knowing nothing about Vietnam and learned an incredible amount about a very unique and interesting place. Piqued my interest to visit one day. Cool class I'd recommend as an elective for upperclassmen looking to take something they'll actually enjoy learning about.</comment>This class was very relaxed and was a great choice as an elective. The professor is awesome, really nice, and flexible about deadlines.</comment>She is a fantastic professor who teaches with enthusiasm for the subject. You will learn so much about a subject that you most likely do not know much about.</comment></course>PSY 15: Social Psychology</title>If you are interested in examining psychology through different lenses, like combining the subject with anthropology, biology, sociology, etc., I would take this class. Personally I often felt lost because it seemed like I was no longer in a psychology class when we were discussing some concepts because they either seemed out of context or were very difficult to connect back to the big picture. Fiery is humorous and an overall great guy, but his lectures aren't very structured and it often took me at least one rewatch of the lecture recording to understand how and why certain studies and ideas were relevant to the bigger topic.</comment>Super interesting materials. Please, please go to lecture! They're so much fun.</comment>PSY15 is amazing!!! Definitely take it with Fiery!</comment>Fiery is the best lecturer! Seriously, all professors at Harvard are smart and brilliant people, but NOT everyone is a good lecturer/teacher. Even though some contents/concepts in this class overlap with SLS 20 or some other psychology seminars, the way Fiery presents the topics are still so interesting that I couldn't wait to go to lectures every week. (Watch out for the lecture where he does vocal fry!!!) He is also very accessible outside class (which is another thing that not every other professor is good at!)   There is a weekly assignment that takes about like 0.5-1 hour a week to complete, but overall the workload is not that overwhelming (though it looks like there are a lot!) The TFs are super helpful. Overall the teaching staff are always there for any questions, concerns, and any help you need to complete the assignments.</comment>This class is very very exciting and interesting and fun. Lectures are definitely worth going to. Fiery Cushman is a great lecturer! The material is extremely interesting and relevant. This is a great elective / gen-ed.</comment>With Fiery as an instructor, this course is more "science-y" (greater emphasis on the brain and on biological explanation) than you might expect a social psychology course to have. Nevertheless, it is completely manageable if you are a humanities person. The material is by definition applicable to the real world, and you will find yourself referencing concepts from the course multiple times a day. A frustration with the course is that the exams are very definition based -- you may understand all the concepts perfectly, but if you didn't sit down to make flashcards and memorize a specific definition, you could easily fail.</comment>Great class. Professor Cushman is an amazing lecturer.</comment>fF you are interested in exposing yourself to the field of Social Psychology, and covering a breadth of topics within the field, this class is perfect for you. If you are simply interested in learning how people think, and operate, I believe that is a quality course for you as well. This class was not always the most engaging class for me, but if you are someone with a strong interest in Social Psychology you will find this class very interesting and engaging.</comment>The lectures in this course are fascinating and they're all videotaped, which is nice. Section is good. The course is really well-paced, it has you stay up-to-date with the material and the assignments are fairly graded. I took this as my SLS class, and I would definitely recommend it (SLS20 not needed)</comment>This is a really interesting class. Fiery is an amazing lecturer, so you'll genuinely enjoy going to class. Assignments are very few and relatively simple and the final project is pretty fun (develop your own psych study), but definitely study a lot for the one midterm and final exam.</comment>If you're looking for an interesting and engaging class with relatively low commitment, then this is the class for you. Professor Cushman was awesome and he really engaged the students with the material.</comment>Good course - lectures are engaging. You don't need to buy the textbook. Grading is fine, as long as you vaguely pay attention in class.</comment>Really solid class.</comment>Professor Cushman is an engaging, funny and generally fantastic lecturer.  He'll make you want to come to class. Additionally, the topics covered are interesting and make you think about the world in a whole new way. I highly recommend this class for the interesting projects (a book review and a research project) and topics.

The annoying part of this class are the required 5 study pool credits, which are pitched as a learning opportunity, but really are a way for the Psych department to get unpaid labor for their studies in a way that no other department does (trying to imagine a Government or Behavioral Economics class that required you to participate in studies without compensation - really, this should hardly be allowed). Rather than being a learning experience, this requires you to sit through hours of completely mind-numbing and mindless activities (for example, one of my studies involved having images flashed at me for 1.5 hours while I guessed what color they were - I got my learning experience out of it after the first 20 minutes). Another annoying bit is how much the mid-terms and exams rely on textbook readings and terms that are not mentioned or covered in class, which makes it difficult to understand how to fit them into the context of the course.</comment>This course was fantastic. Fiery's lectures were great and section was usually interesting. Take this class if you want to better understand how people operate on a more grand scale and if you're interested in investigating social phenomena that interest you.</comment>Pay attention! The information is helpful, interesting, and amazing.</comment>Be sure to attend section for recap of challenging concepts and to rematch lecture slides––even when you are passively going over the material and think you have mastered it, learning this material is challenging and requires going back over it for many people in this class.</comment>The class provided a great foundation for psychology in general and covered a wide range of topics, but the exams are both all multiple choice and cover material from both lecture and the book, so you have to either stay on top of your readings during the semester or spend a super long time cramming before the exam. Pretty great class though!</comment>I loved this class; the thing about psych is that we often think that the conclusions reached are obvious, but there are often things that we think that are obviously true that are not, in addition to surprising facts about our own psychology that have a large effect on our decisions and attitudes toward various ideas. This class will teach you all about that and will also allow you to engage with the material on a more personal level since you'll get to conduct your own experiment. The source books that you read to help you think of an idea for your experiment are interesting in themselves as well. The TFs are nice and available if you have questions, and Fiery's pretty cool as well. The exams are very generous on time, and the staff even used a concept from the course on one of the exams to help us out/give a laugh to those who noticed!</comment>You learn lots of interesting things about psychology and better understand how people think. Lectures were engaging.</comment>If you're looking for an SLS credit, look no further. This class is by far the best one you'll find. PSY 15 is everything SLS 20 wishes it could be, but with better and fewer assignments and more straightforward exams. Fiery's lectures are engaging and comprehensive, and the material covers a range of topics including racism, game theory, and cultural development, all in a respectful, data-driven way.</comment>The material presented is quite interesting and the lectures were very clear and well-prepared. Plus, things like the fundamental attribution error and cognitive dissonance are generally useful to know about</comment>Amazing lectures and Fiery is awesome! Everyone who is interested in social psychology should take this course! It will make you think a lot. Key to do well on the exams: read the book & take notes during the year; during reading period - rewatch the lecture videos and review notes. Nothing is tricky on the exam, very straightforward.</comment>Great course to fulfill the SLS gen ed. In my opinion, the most painless SLS class. I don't know if I learned a lot from this class though; it's a relaxed easy class.</comment>It's a very good class as a first psychology class.</comment>Watch the lecture videos to prepare for the exams.</comment>Fiery is the best lecturer I've ever had, and makes all the material extremely intuitive and interesting (although it is pretty interesting in the first place). Would definitely recommend as the best way to fulfill SLS.</comment>If you haven't taken psych before, this is a good introductory course. It is not difficult and does not require a high amount of work; it's possible to do well without ever attending lectures or owning the textbook if you are willing to study hard for exams.</comment>Take this class if you are interested in how and why people behave the way they do.</comment>This course is like Freakanomics in class form with more useful studies and better science.  The lectures were entertaining and they taught counterintuitive and practical aspects of social psychology that can be used in daily life to better understand how people interact.</comment>This is a great class. Professor Cushman is an amazing lecturer; he's always enthusiastic and has a great sense of humor, and is also usually interactive. He's clearly excited about the subject matter and it's infectious. You cover all sorts of topics related to social psychology, from baby morality to why people become addicted to cocaine. Really interesting subject material, plus, it's not too difficult of a class in the slightest.</comment>Really good gen-ed or elective--you learn a lot, the information is presented very well, and it's pretty low-stress</comment>Social Psychology is one of the best courses I've taken at Harvard. Fiery Cushman is young, energetic and passionate about what he teaches, and is also an excellent lecturer. The material is engaging and relevant, and the final project provides a low-stress opportunity to sample research in psychology. There are eight short weekly assignments of 150-250 words in addition to the final project, which includes a 1000-word commentary assignment, a short proposal, and the report itself, which is 2000 words. The course staff does a good job walking you through the steps of the project, including the write-up and the statistical analysis they expect. The lectures are videotaped, but I definitely suggest attending class, and then you can re-watch the lectures to study for the midterm and final. The midterm and final are very fair, and consist of 40 and 60 4-answer multiple choice questions, respectively. Sections are mandatory, but really helpful. Laura was a fantastic TF, and very accessible. It is very possible to do well in this class with a reasonable amount of effort. (I took it because I was interested in the topic; I'm not a psych concentrator.) Overall, highly recommend.</comment>I took this class as a senior to fulfill SLS. The material is interesting, relevant to your life/interactions/groups/Harvard/etc. However, this is not the easiest way to fulfill the requirement. It also requires a lot of memorization and the assessment is not easy. It is a lot of memorization. Fiery was great and everyone say's Greene is great too. You can't go wrong. It's manageable in that it is videotaped, has clear expectations, and will not require much work on the week to week assignments. However, the midterm/finals require a lot of studying and are quite difficult - even if you think you are good at memorizing. They do curve them, slightly, though.</comment>This was an amazing course, and Fiery articulately teaches with obvious enthusiasm about the subject matter. Social psychology is incredibly important in retrospect, and it has enabled me to scrutinize human interaction on a whole new level. Take this if Fiery is teaching!</comment>This is a solid class that covers an array of concepts in social psychology, ranging from stereotyping and prejudice to attraction and relationships. The material is engaging (and super applicable to your everyday life), the workload is on the lighter side, and the professor is really great as well. Recommended.</comment>TAKE PSYCH 15!!!!!! It's unquestionably one of the best courses I have taken at Harvard so far, not only because of Fiery - who is incredibly insightful, funny, and personable as a professor and a person - but also because of the sheer content of the course. Social psychology is so interesting and applicable to real life, and there is no better way to learn about it than from someone who knows as much about it as Fiery in this course. It's also a very manageable workload and all of the assignments are pertinent and meaningful, and you will find yourself looking forward to lecture and all of the new ideas and insights you will come away from each day.</comment>Fiery is an amazingly engaging professor, and the course material actually changed the way I think about things in everyday life. Take it if Fiery teaches again.</comment>This course is extremely interesting. I enjoyed both, going to lectures and reading the material in the textbook. You will learn more about yourself and others by examining the social relationships between people. Although interesting, this course is challenging. Since the material covered in class is not the same as what is in the textbook, you have to keep up with readings and lectures. I recommend reading a chapter per week and attending all lectures as to not fall behind.</comment>Social Psych is a great class and super applicable to the real world- its a decent amount of work, but definitely worth it.</comment>Fiery's lectures are an absolute treat—he does a truly phenomenal job of making the information relevant, weighty, and fresh. I definitely wouldn't worry about taking SLS 20 before this class—there's some, but not too much, overlap. Finally, aside from ease of grading, there's no reason why the exams for this class need to be multiple choice—I would highly recommend that future iterations of the course change this to a short response-style exam, which demands accurate, rather than vague, understanding of the concepts tested.</comment>Fiery Cushman is by far the best lecturer I have had at Harvard. All of his lecture presentations are extremely interesting, and for some reason remind me of TED talks.</comment>Social psychology by the nature of its discipline is a wonderful intersection between biology and the social sciences that can fascinate students from any backgrounds. The course is designed wonderfully and the lectures are wonderful.</comment>This is by far my favorite course at Harvard. It has the rare combination of being fascinating and relatively little work. You usually get fascinating/impossible or boring/easy courses but this one had the best of both worlds. Fiery is so passionate about what he teaches that lecture is truly fun. I enjoyed every minute of this class and I'm really disappointed that this class had to end.</comment>Take this class! Fiery is a really engaging lecture, and the course material - which can be quite convoluted at times - is very well organized and explained. Make sure to study both the book and lectures in preparation for the midterm and final.</comment>Fiery is a powerhouse academic who will become a huge name in the field in the years to come.  A pleasure and an honor to learn from him.</comment>This class is really really cool and Fiery is such a great lecturer!! If you're looking for some way to fulfill SLS, this is the way to do it. It is objectively a really interesting and relevant to your life and this world, and it is a subject matter that I think should be incorporated into many more courses. Definitely do readings.. that's the only way to do well on the midterm and final. The project is the most fun part! have fun with it.</comment>Fiery entertains during lecture. The material is engaging and applicable.</comment>It was great definitely take it even if you think you're not "good" at science</comment>This is a class with great bang for your buck. Fiery is an astoundingly dynamic lecturer, and every presentation will have you laughing, or, at the very worst, at the edge of your seat in rapt interest. The material is very engaging, though if you don't have a personal interest in understanding the concepts of social psychology, then I really don't suggest taking this class for an "easy Gen Ed" or something. There's a lot to cover, and you will get swamped if you're bored. That being said, it is very hard to be bored with this subject, especially with the fantastic way in which Fiery presents the material. I don't believe I've taken a better course at Harvard yet.</comment>This course is highly recommended for all students who are looking find out more about emotions, attitudes, behavior, and more. It is easy to think that you know everything about yourself, but this course raises many thought-provoking points that I am sure most people are unaware of.</comment>This was a really great class. Fiery is such an engaging lecturer and does a really good job presenting enough, interesting evidence while making it clear how course themes apply to your own life/the world around us. It's really interesting to learn about and very applicable. It isn't too much work. You'll have weekly assignments but they are quick. There's a commentary on a book-not that consuming. The experiment you'll have to do seems daunting at first but it isn't that bad, you'll get guidance, and if you pick something you care about it is fun to do and illuminating. Really good course and great (stress-free) way to fulfill gen-ed requirements.</comment>Incredible course - Fiery was great and I learned a ton about how individuals work in the context of relationships, society, and an evolutionary standpoint. Only negative was that there were a ton of assignments that seemed like busy-work.</comment>This class is awesome, just make sure you go to lecture and read the textbook, both are tested in exams. Otherwise, awesome class.</comment>It's a good SLS course.</comment>TAKE IT!!! It will change the way you approach group settings and social situations.  The lectures are extremely interesting and engaging.  I really did have fun reading the text, going to class, doing the assignments and project, participating in studies, even studying for the exams.  Fiery was great!!  If he keeps teaching it, definitely take it with him.</comment>This course is really great if you're interested in social psychology. However, I wouldn't recommend it if you like your studying clearly defined - there are a lot of sometimes vague and overlapping terms and theories that can be confusing. I did like the final project as it offers the opportunity to be creative and design your own study, and Professor Cushman was a great lecturer.</comment>If Fiery is the lecturer, take this class! And probably take it even if he is not. Don't worry about taking SLS 20 if you haven't; you'll be fine without any prior knowledge of psych. The lectures are great and engaging because of Fiery. Also, make sure you read and know all the textbook's vocab before the midterm and final, because he puts a lot of that stuff on there, and doesn't talk about it in lecture.</comment>Please attend the lectures in person, for your own sake. You'll remember the material better if you go.</comment>TAKE THIS CLASS IT'S A PERFECT GEN ED</comment>take it. take it as a fifth, a sixth class, it's worth it because this material will shape how you perceive others and how they perceive you; invariably, for the better</comment>Great class! Tough exams, but you learn a lot</comment>This course IS SO RELEVANT. Legit. It sheds light on so many human idiosyncrasies: why we believe what we believe; how our individual selves are so heavily influenced by the external. Take this before graduating! It'll help you become a better human being and more self-aware.</comment>You'll learn lots of fun applicable information!</comment>Fiery is an engaging lecturer, and the material is interesting.</comment>Social psychology is an interesting subject and Fiery is a good lecturer.  There is a significant amount of work each week with textbook reading, weekly assignments, final projects and midterm/ final prep.</comment>This course covers a ton of material, much of which feels like common sense, but you will leave it feeling like you learned a lot of really interesting stuff. Professor Cushman is an amazing lecturer, although sometimes you may feel overwhelmed because he covers so much in such a short amount of time. The class is minimal work, but you should definitely keep up with the reading because exams include stuff from the textbook that is not covered in class and they can be a little tricky. Definitely spend time studying for exams and get to know your section leader, because they're awesome and really helpful. I definitely recommend this class if you're looking for a fun, pretty easy class that will teach you some basic psychological theory.</comment>very interesting class</comment>This class is incredibly interesting. The weekly assignments make you keep up with the class, and sections are mandatory.  Don't procrastinate on reading your book!! It will take time to think of a counter-theory. You get to conduct an experiment (it can be observational), and they don't grade you very harshly, which is considerate given most people have never run a psych experiment.</comment>This class put into perspective for me just how many biases I have in the way I think. The message wasn't that these evolutionary and cultural biases were good or bad; although many of them explain why humans are the most advanced life-forms on Earth. More importantly, though, this class made me examine the way I think, either because I was raised to approach situations a certain way, or because it's an innate response. Now I know to make sure I push myself farther when thinking critically, and to make sure I'm not falling back on some tendency or bias that clouds my judgment of the situation. I know what traps I am prone to falling into, whether evaluating criminals, different cultures, or moral situations. I learned to acknowledge my biases without being proud of them, and stubbornly rooting myself in them.</comment>It's very light work for most of the semester (short assignments which don't take time if you were at lecture), but studying for exams takes time because you need to read the large textbook as well as re-watch the lecture videos.</comment>Fiery is a fantastic lecturer: intriguing, relatable, and fun!  The information is something that everyone should learn in order to understand the world around them and how we as humans interact with other humans.</comment>This is definitely a great course to take, even if you aren't going to be a psych concentrator. The content was pretty interesting and the course staff are really helpful/not trying to make the course more difficult than it has to be. The one recommendation that I would make is to try to keep up readings each week as opposed to trying to wait until the midterm/final.</comment>I recommend this class strongly to all students, no matter one's academic interest. It is impossible not to find the course material applicable to most aspects of your life, daily and otherwise. You'll find yourself thinking differently.</comment>This class is easy to the point of boredom. However, the lectures are entertaining and make up for the high school level material. I took this class for the novel experience of designing my own experiment. However, I don't feel like I ended up with an experiment that particularly interested me. You might want to come into this class with some idea of what you already want to do. Be sure to complete all of the weekly assignments. The quick turn-around from Friday (when the assignment is announced) to the deadline (Friday or Saturday night) sometimes caught me off-guard. The class has two multiple-choice exams that count for a combined 45% of your grade. I don't particularly like Multiple-Choice questions, though the exams were fair, in that everything included was something important we learned. Sections are a ridiculous waste of time, but I suppose that may be in-built to science classes.</comment>The material is interesting, but the lectures are somewhat dry. A decent number of questions on the midterm and final will cover material from the textbook so make sure to do the readings. Sections were fun and interactive!</comment>Attending sections is great review. READ THE TEXTBOOK. There are things not covered in lecture that show up on exams that made me regret not reading.</comment>Psych 15 was a great way to do SLS. I am not a psych concentrator and had not taken SLS 20 and it was still very approachable. The material is not easy - you need to put some time in when it comes to exams and give the assignments some real thought, but most of the content was really interesting. The midterm was mostly fair and straightforward. A lot of what made this class great was Fiery - he's a really good lecturer and has an amazing way of making complicated concepts very clear, especially to people with no psych background.</comment>Fiery is, without a doubt, one of the best lecturers at Harvard. The lectures are recorded, but I would not miss it. You'll do better on the exams and leave with a great understanding of social psychology.</comment>Social psych is a great way to do SLS, much better than SLS 20. It's far more interesting and it's easier. Fiery is a great lecturer but they're also recorded so you can go back and watch. All of the assignments are fairly straightforward and kind of fun.</comment>The lectures are awesome. Definitely worth going to, even though there are videos online. Also, the best possible way to study for exams is to just watch lecture videos again.</comment>This is a course that allows you to fulfill SLS easily and gain some dope info.</comment>Interesting lectures with a passionate instructor. Painless assignments.</comment>I would recommend this course to anyone with even the slightest bit of interest in psychology. Professor Cushman is so knowledgeable and his lectures are very engaging. The exams are fair; the written assignments are thoughtfully designed and often leave room for creativity. The highlight of the semester is definitely the final project, in which each student has the opportunity to design and conduct a social psychology experiment.</comment></course>SCI-PHYUNV 21: Stellar Understanding of the Cosmos</title>This class is great. Please take it not just for the GenEd requirement (it's probably not the easiest SPU class) but because you're really interested in the material, otherwise it's a waste of really nice and competent teaching staff.</comment>This is a special course at Harvard: it is small, hands on, and intriguing. The teacher staff is great and extremely dedicated. However, the evaluations are not extremely reflective of the course (I think this is changing so that it is). And sometimes that lectures are a little long (since it is a 1 1/2 hour long class).</comment>This class has the potential to be hands-down the best class at Harvard. A few organizational changes--weekly quizzes, no true or false on exams, and weekly review components of sections--would make it fantastic. It is an extremely large amount of material to learn but it is an amazing introduction to astronomy and at the end you will be surprised by how much you learned. In the end, you can explain how the universe began and how it will end, and how all the stuff that occurred in between came about too. Josh is an amazingly knowledgeable lecturer and is responsive, receptive, and interesting in the well-being of his students. The weekly observation sections are an amazing opportunity and if you dedicate some time to this class and its readings it will be very manageable. If you do not, it will be difficult. This is not an easy SPU, but it is extremely rewarding.</comment></course>VES 10br: Drawing 2: Drawing Expanded</title>Whether you love art or are considering VES, you should take this class. It gives you freedom to explore what is considered a drawing and will challenge you to surprise yourself. However, be aware that it will take a huge chunk out of your schedule.</comment>Really great class, of course particularly if you already enjoy drawing, but also if you don't have any experience drawing/find it difficult</comment>This class with help you improve your skills and eye of looking immensely. Plus, its a great stress reliever and escape from everyday life.</comment>This class is wonderful. Katarina pushes you aesthetically in ways you would never expect. My work progresses during the semester, though I was also able to be truthful to my own voice.</comment>I had never taken a serious drawing class prior to this, and I am honestly now pretty hooked on drawing. Katarina and Sally do a great job of helping each person grow, regardless of where they started out.</comment>This course was great. You will be around students of all levels, yet it benefits and improves all.  You'll learn a lot technically and visually. You'll be introduced to the works of many great artists. You'll be taught by an amazing artist. I don't think you could ask for more.</comment></course>TWI 101ar: Reading in Twi</title>Great class. You will get out what you put in.</comment>If you've taken any Twi before, this is a great way to learn some more. It's not inordinately stressful, and it's not going to pile up your workload if you're already taking very heavy classes. Definitely go for it.</comment>Take this class!</comment>It is a great course. It is thought very well and at a pace that can be understood by all the students.</comment></course>MANCHU A: Elementary Manchu</title>Take it! It's a blast. It's fun. It'll be educational. Admittedly, you should probably only take this if you have a specialized interest that somehow relates to Manchus/the Qing, but regardless, a good thoroughly educational time was had by all.</comment>Very enjoyable class especially if you are interested in using Manchu academically. Beware te script is quite difficult at first but you will get used to it.</comment></course>E&M-REASON 20: The Business and Politics of Health</title>Take this class if you want to learn about the ACA, beyond "is it moral/constitutional." Take it to understand how your insurance plan is going to work when you enter the real world, and don't have your parents to take care of everything for you. Take it to understand that you are being bad for society when you take advantage of your cheaper health care, and that you should instead consider the fact that someone, somewhere is paying for those meds. Take it if you want to learn about health care from the man who basically wrote all of the ACA - and it's not a biased class - you actually learn about studies showing that it might be completely useless towards improving health outcomes. Just TAKE IT!</comment>This class, for what its worth, requires not much work. If you are taking it for Econ credit, the second half of the course effectively doesnt mean much for your evaluation. That being said, I am SURE you can find a better option than this class. This class was one of the more frustrating experiences in my academic time at Harvard. The class was incredibly disorganized, with no structure to any of the assignments and little real tie between the assignments and the material. The class was not economic enough nor empirical or mathematical enough. The tests were completely arbitrary. My TF could not speak english. And Professor Cutler is too caught up in his own ego to provide a fair analysis of the business and politics of health.</comment>If you don't know too much about the health care system in the U.S. then I would highly recommend this course! You will leave the class knowing so many different aspects of the health care system that it is so worth it</comment>way exams and answers are written are completely separate from the class, need to do the additional readings and also learn what they want you to write and how they want you to write it</comment>You learn a lot about health insurance / health care systems / the ACA, though it's a lot to cover in one course. Try to keep up with each unit/important readings so you don't get confused/bogged down when studying for midterm/final.</comment>If you're interested in health policy and insurance, the second half of the course will be really interesting to you! The first half is more focused on global health that you can get at any other global health class but the second half is really what makes this course so special. This course is really good at learning about insurances and health care--knowledge that we need to know in the real world and cannot get anywhere else.</comment>A great perspective on the US health system from a professor who is undoubtedly an authority on the subject.  Suffers from the usual growing pains of a large gened, but ultimately a good experience for anyone seeking a better understanding of the history of medical systems, health insurance, the Affordable Care Act, or any other topic in US health policy.</comment>This class is great if you have an interest in health care policy.</comment>This is a great intro to healthcare class if you're looking to get a broad idea of how healthcare works in the U.S. Professor Cutler is an engaging and prepared lecturer. It was a really good class!</comment>Generally low workload.  Lectures are dry and get repetitive at times.  However, the health care debate is a very interesting topic to analyze and the professor is one of the best in the field.</comment>If you are at all interested in learning about health care both around the world and in the US take this class! I learned so much that will be so useful in life, which I can't say about most of my classes. Also, Professor Cutler literally wrote Obamacare so you are learning from the best.</comment>I wish this class moved faster. We spent a lot of time on qualitative concepts and I feel like I didn't take away as much from the course as I had hoped. Painless way to fulfill the econ requirement but the grading is a bit harsh.</comment>I love healthcare economics and was really excited when I found that this course would count for economics credit if you write a final essay. However, the course was much slower paced and less economics based than I was hoping. Although I truly did learn a lot anyways and really enjoyed the course, I wish I had known about the lack of economics beforehand!</comment>Fairly easy, genuinely interesting. I came in knowing nothing about American health care and now feel quite well informed. There is mandatory weekly section and p-sets. The midterm is fair and grades are scaled. I recommend it as a manageable class that you can actually get something useful out of regardless of how engaged you are with the material.</comment>This is a good E&MR class for those not math-inclined. The math in this class isn't too hard and, more importantly, it's relevant to your life. You learn skills that help you understand the pricing of health care and understand how you can make the most of insurance.</comment>TAKE THIS CLASS! If you have any interest in why good quality healthcare is still lacking in much of the world and much of the US, and/or want to understand Obamacare, this class is amazing. David Cutler is hilarious and breaks things down so well so that you can see the essential conflicts in all these controversies and decide for yourself what you think the right policy actions are. There's not a ton of quantitative analysis in the class, but when it's there it's really interesting, not too complex at all, and rounds out a really solid understanding of the determinants of healthcare, outside of the medical procedures. David Kim is also the best TF ever, and the readings for the class are super interesting. You won't regret taking this class.</comment>Taking pass fail is definitely beneficial of impartial grading</comment>the material was really interesting, which was why it was a bummer that none of the assignments or the exams had anything to do with the material. Or even if the questions we were asked reflected material we had learned, the questions would be very open ended but be graded on such a strict rubric that was impossible to predict that studying the material would have no bearing on your grade.</comment>The course material is really interesting and very relevant to your lives, the lives of your families and of society in general. Lecture essentially goes over the readings, so if you do those you should be able to follow lecture easily (or just listen in lecture). P-sets are not very challenging and overall the course is not very time demanding, but it does help you explore healthcare and introduces concepts of economics that are really useful. I recommend this course.</comment>EMR 20 is a wonderful introduction to health policy and provides a survey of both global health policy as well as domestic/American health policy, though there is more emphasis on improving healthcare in the United States. You should be aware that this is very much not a quantitative class- even though it is empirical and mathematical reasoning, there is very little of it. It is much more about learning how to approach healthcare issues from multiple policy angles. David Cutler is a fantastic professor- combines policy and academia really well.</comment>Really chill class where you learn a lot of interesting stuff about the healthcare system. Reminded me a lot of SW24 the first few weeks but really turned into a class about the healthcare system which I liked more.</comment>Take this course for sure- especially if you are premed and want to be a more informed citizen about health care. The first half of the course is especially interesting, while the second half is more economics focussed. You do not need any prior economics training. Would highly recommend writing the paper- it is a really cool way to explore an interest you have.</comment>Easy class, but keep in mind that it's an intro course</comment>The course is really interesting and eye-opening and the readings are fun (especially the NYT articles and some of the scholarly articles). You don't need any background in economics and you can pick up some statistics along the way. Professor Cutler is a great lecture, funny with lots of experience, and you have a pretty good idea of the problems in health care and some potential solutions. The exams and half of the psets tend to be vague and sometimes don't have correct answers, which is hard to study for and do.</comment>the exams are pretty difficult, need to know the details of the lectures, and think critically; may include some stuff not extensively covered in section or lecture</comment>The effectiveness of the TFs and sections could be improved. Some TFs can be pretty unresponsive and unhelpful, and they take a very, very long time to grade problem sets. That said, grading can be harsh and seem arbitrary or unfair sometimes. Overall, the course is good, but I would recommend it with reservations.</comment>If you're interested in today's health and the state of health care, this class is a must. I learned more than I would ever thought about healthcare and the fundamentals behind it all.</comment>This course provides a great overview of US health care policy and also the economics aspect of many global health problems.</comment>This is a great course, especially to fulfill your USW requirement. It's not demanding in a way that would affect your focus on your main concentration courses, but really pushes you to think about healthcare and public health in a new perspective. Very chill class to take for a GenEd and yet you learn so many interesting new things about our world. Prof. Cutler is an amazing lecturer, problem sets are very fair. Midterm and final were also very fair, not a bad class at all. I highly recommend it.</comment>Really, you should take this course to become a more educated citizen. I admit that I really disliked the class for the first half of the semester, but then I began to realize how much I was actually learning and how relevant the subject material is to current national and international conversations.</comment>This course, although discussing very interesting topics, is a bit more work than expected as there are many readings, and it is at times difficult to grasp the subject material because there really are no concrete answers to the complex debatable current system of healthcare. Although you do leave the course with much more knowledge about he current healthcare system and I feel that i now understand insurance companies so much more which will help me in the real world. Also, Professor Cutler truly is a great individual, and lecturer.</comment>Great class; easy way to meet the GHHP requirement. Not as much math as I thought, which I liked. Overall it was really good.</comment>You will learn a lot of important and useful things about health care and insurance.  Good EMR for humanities. Lots of reading but you can get away with not doing most of it.</comment>Problems sets are very easy but it's impossible to keep up with the amount of readings, only take this class of you have a direct interest in pursuing this subject.</comment>If you want a corse that combines all elements of gen ed, then take this. Seriously, it should count for ethical gen ed, study of the past, etc. There's just so many themes in this class. You will come out of it a better person and a more knowledgeable one. The class is easy, but you will learn a lot at the same time.</comment>0 Math in it</comment>I took it to fulfill EMR, and it is not a bad way to do that. There is very little math, only some general economics-type concepts and very few, (and short) problem sets. If you are generally interested in healthcare policy, Professor Cutler's lectures are somewhat interesting, though very broad and general, and the class attempts to cover way too much and therefore does little very well.</comment>Although "The Business and Politics of Health" taught by Dr. David Cutler sounds like a dream come truth to any future physician, economics, or health policymaker, be forewarned. This class is not worth your time. Professor Cutler is renowned in his field, yet an ineffective lecturer in the classroom. He has virtually no control over his TF staff either, as there were such inconsistencies in section instruction quality and grading of assignments. The midterm is also an unacceptable assessment of student performance in the course. As a student who had attended every lecture and was familiar with every reading, performing below average due to not providing precisely the answers on the midterm exam that were desired was infuriating. Problem sets seemed straightforward, but if you are taking the course for economics credit, note that the additional problems were terribly worded. Section was extremely weak as I mentioned, and assignments were not turned back in a timely manner. Head TF David Kim is quite full of himself, and does not know how to interact with students via email. The saving grace of this course is the term paper / final exam option. The term paper truly gives you the chance to go in depth into a topic of your choice, which I found edifying. In sum, do not take EMR 20, and instead spend some time reading a healthcare economics book (or Cutler's own work) on your own time.</comment>It's a pretty good course, but you may not learn as much concrete material as you expect to. Also, who your TF is will really affect your impression of the course, so hope that you get a good one!</comment>it is a great genED, a relaxed class and you learn a lot about the healthcare</comment>It gives you a very basic understanding that is useful in navigating a world dominated by healthcare.</comment>Professor Cutler has an evident passion for health policy and genuinely seems to want to facilitate discussion amongst students. If you have any interest in health policy, I would definitely recommend this course.</comment>While this class is minimal work, it is not an easy A because there is a lot of subjectivity in grading. That said, the material is very interesting and important.</comment>problem sets were graded very tough, but interesting material and a great alternative economics class</comment>Only take this course if you don't know anything about global health or health care and want to learn the basics. I didn't know anything, so I thought this course was really refreshing! I'm not sure how much my friends who are pre-med liked it though...they seemed bored.</comment>You do not need any specific background.</comment>This class is so interesting and you learn a tremendous amount! But actually do the readings, and do not get behind.</comment>The lectures were very boring and repetitive from the readings. The economics behind the material was significantly dumbed down.</comment>The course material is extremely interesting, and Prof. Cutler makes you look forward to coming to lecture (quite a feat for a class that meets at 10 am!).</comment>easy gened, useful to learn about health policy and insurance, but not always the most exciting</comment>I call this a trap class. The material is relatively difficult, but the class comes off as really easy for awhile until you actually have an assignment</comment>This class was a good intro into healthcare and all the issues surrounding the field. The workload is pretty low, and as long as you due the readings, the midterm/finals aren't bad. I did the term paper for my econ secondary, and they give you a lot of flexibility in your topic (which can be a good or bad thing!) Overall, low work class for an econ/gen ed req, so I would recommend this class if the topic is at all interesting to you!</comment>This was a great introduction to some economics and policy thinking and I found the material interesting and the lectures engaging and my TF was always very accessible to discuss the finer points of the course. I recommend this course as a good introduction to health economics with excellent readings and not too much work at all.</comment>Take it, as it's a good class. Interesting from a global health perspective and an economic perspective. 

Just be warned about the grading--it's not a GPA killer, but it is very arbitrary and section-dependent.</comment>Prepare to put in the work and make sure you have a liking for health systems</comment>The lectures are surprisingly engaging and Cutler has a wide range of actual experience designing healthcare policy that makes the course more interesting.  If you are taking the class for Econ credit, beware of the final paper.  It takes quite a bit of time and is difficult to do without having taken metrics or the sophomore tutorial.  Otherwise, very painless way to fulfill requirements.</comment>Cutler's lectures are great - for me, this was reason enough alone to take the class. However, the unfortunate truth is that because a) problem sets usually don't actually require any knowledge of lecture concepts and b) of the term paper option, there is very little motivation for students to actually come to lecture after the midterm, if at all. That said, overall it was an interesting course that covered a lot of interesting material from a really interesting perspective.</comment>It is extremely disorganized and there are plenty of other health courses that are much better.</comment>Although this class lingered on some topics, the material was not only relevant, but taught in an enthusiastic way by someone who is at the top of their field. It is an easy class, but a great way to fulfill a gen ed requirement that teaches you something meaningful.</comment>Everyone should learn material, it's super relevant!</comment>Take this course if you're very interested in health care policy. The course spends a long time on health care history/policy and not that much time on empirical methods, which I was hoping for.</comment>Nice and easy way to fulfill USW requirement. Material is somewhat interesting, but lectures can get long and tiring.</comment>You'll get a nice introduction to the health care system of the United States, albeit a strongly one-sided view.  Professor Cutler, a proponent of Obamacare and former advisor to President Obama, will impart his own beliefs about the health care system either overtly or implicitly (e.g. via the readings).</comment>This is an incredible course taught by an amazing professor and teaching fellows. After taking this course I walk away with a much better understanding of how our health care system works, its flaws, and its benefits. The readings and assignments are not demanding and you get a lot out of this class. This is a great life-class to take (I took it as an elective and am so grateful).</comment>interesting class but few gradable points to contribute to overall letter grade.</comment>Professor Cutler is absolutely hilarious, and the material and discussion in class was really fascinating. The concepts were all really easy, especially if you took Econ or Stats at any level before, but what was a lot trickier was that the questions (except for the quantitative ones, which unfortunately there weren't much of) were so open-ended and at least for the first half of the semester, we had no clue what the point breakdown was that they were looking for. This was fixed though second semester, and it also fulfills US-W without necessarily having to write any essays! 

If you're at all interested in healthcare (or maybe even if you're not), I highly, highly recommend this class as I really enjoyed the discussions and material. If nothing else, you should take this class for Prof. Cutler.</comment>Cutler is a great lecturer, the problem sets are manageable, and the readings are interesting. Take this class if you have any interest in healthcare economics or even think you might!</comment>It is really interesting subject material that is totally relevant and applicable to you right now.  The course can be slow at times, but those moments could be really great opportunities for  you to do a little bit of exploration on your own.</comment>Readings are necessary for the exam and therefore should be done. Problem sets are not very difficult. Lectures are really interesting -- Cutler is GREAT.</comment>EMR 20 provides a nice opportunity to learn about really relevant concepts (major players in healthcare economics, insurance systems, Obamacare, etc..) in a relatively enjoyable and not-too stressful way. Professor Cutler is really cool (if you go to lecture), but you can learn nearly all the important concepts in section. Problem sets are fairly quick and easy, too, and the class has a nice option (for non-econ concentrators) to either write a final paper or take the final exam. As a warning, the midterm wasn't difficult but does ask you to reference specific course readings, so although you don't really need to do them for lecture/section you might want to at least skim them throughout the semester. Overall, this class was great way to both satisfy a gen ed and learn about a highly pertinent subject.</comment>Professor Cutler is very knowledgeable and delivers interesting lectures, but the class is very basic and the economic component to it is very superficial. I expected to learn way more economics. If you have only taken EC10 then you will be at a disadvantage for the paper because most people taking the course for EC credit are Seniors.</comment>Super painless way to fulfill your US in the world gen-Ed (and even less painful for EMR since the "math" is basically multiplication and addition). I thought the second half of the course that actually focused on what Cutler specializes in (the American health care system) was definitely the strongest part; the first half on global health was pretty scattered and couldn't say I learned too much. It's definitely not a difficult course but you do learn a lot; it's actually shocking how little everyone knows on how insurance works since that's something we'll all have to deal with pretty soon in our lives. Good for a basic intro into US healthcare but don't expect to go into too much.</comment>Fascinating guide to health care from a leading expert and one of the best professors I've encountered at Harvard. Take it! Also, to address a concern I had coming in--I have absolutely no economics background and found the course quite accessible</comment>This was a very interesting class that can be very relevant to the world of health care today.</comment>It's an interesting course, and obviously David Cutler is a very prominent figure in the healthcare community (ACA). That being said, it was very easy to take the course as a joke and never attend lecture and simply do the problem sets every two weeks.  I perhaps would have enjoyed it more had I taken it more seriously and had the time to really learn the material, but it's an easy way for humanities majors to fulfill EMR and an easy way for science/math people to fulfill USW.</comment>It's not terribly easy. But it's a cool class and you learn a good amount about health and healthcare and society.</comment>Very boring, very inconsistent grading</comment>This course is a great introduction to get a basic understanding of the US health care system. The workload is very manageable, and no economics background is necessary to understand the concepts.</comment>This class could be one of the best classes at Harvard! Unfortunately it is severely hindered by the focus on making students' lives incredibly stressful. The grading expectations are NEVER made clear and points are subtracted for unknown reasons. Cutler is great though and by far the only reason to take the class</comment>This is a great course! Professor Cutler is really engaging and gives great lectures, and it's really great to get his perspective since he really is in the thick of health care policy in the U.S. The psets are really manageable and it's an especially great class if you're trying to get your economics writing credit--you don't get many guidelines or restrictions on the term paper, but it's really nice to have the chance to write a lot about something you're really interested in. The class on the whole will change your understanding of health care here in the U.S. and around the world. Definitely take this course!</comment>take only if you are interested in the lecture material. there is very little math, like almost none so don't take this as a math course. problem sets are easy.</comment>Very interesting look and how health care works, one of the more practical classes taught at the college. Teaching staff isn't great and section is a big waste of time. Its a good class, but not great.</comment>This course was really engaging; Professor Cutler is a great lecturer. I would recommend the class to anyone interested in public policy.</comment>The section component to this class was irrelevant, and didn't help my understanding of the material.  Overall I thought David Cutler was an interesting and compelling figure, but the administration of the class left me with an overall negative experience.</comment>Besides the mystery of how grading is done in this course, there is nothing bad about it. You get to learn from a policy expert, and you learn the material very well if you are interested.</comment>This is a solid course for garnering a useful understanding of the business side of healthcare, as well as understanding the current problems that affect the system.</comment>Interesting material, but would be so much better if it weren't a gen ed. The assessments do not accurately measure your knowledge of the material but how good a test-taker you are.</comment>It's a good course taught by an expert in the field. However, I wasn't very fond of how large the class was- it seemed pretty overwhelming at times. Also, the midterm was graded very harshly... I would say unnecessarily so. That said, I came out of it with a new, more wholesome understanding of health insurance and its role in the economy.</comment>You learn a lot in this class, but the assessments often don't reflect that.</comment>Not life changing, but a good course on a complex contemporary issue</comment>The course material is extremely interesting, and David Cutler is a great lecturer (I love his sense of humor). However, as the concepts in the class are rather simple, grading can be harsh in the sense that you don't really know what exactly the teaching staff is looking for at all times.</comment>Great course. Covers a lot of interesting material. Especially if you do the readings, you will learn a ton about the business and politics of health!</comment>Great class! Especially if you have a econ background but don't want to take it for the ec requirement / are just taking it as a general elective.</comment>Could be very frustrating for those who do not find the material interesting and who do not like the lecture style</comment>Prof. Cutler is overly proud of his work. In class, we would frequently go to the website of a health organization and, lo and behold, it was a self-plug by David Cutler. For example, during lecture he would go to the Mass Health website and scroll down. As students, we thought there'd be some form of important information, yet the only point was for Cutler to point out that he's on the Mass Board of Health Directors. There were many other examples of this; for example, he spent an entire 1.5hr lecture name-dropping (think Obama, etc.) and displaying his own papers, for which he had to point out that unsurprisingly, he was first author. 

The course was very interesting in the beginning, and it was my favorite class going into the semester. However, a combination of poor teaching staff and vague assignments made me very frustrated by mid-October. The TFs are very disconnected from the course and sections were disorganized (some TFs also had very strong accents that made them hard to understand). The final paper (for Ec concentrators) was also ridiculous in its requirements. Head TF David Kim required you to use data to make a meaningful contribution to the medical field by either 1) finding a dataset and running unique regressions from anyone else in the field, 2) building your own dataset, or 3) conducting a systematic literature review on a health topic that is publishable and makes a unique contribution to the medical field. For one, datasets are very difficult to come by, and very few people even knew how to use Stata. Two, building your own dataset takes years. Three, we're not medical students or Ph.D students, so how can you expect us to understand the nuances of clinical trials and expertly compare them?

Expect your grade to be a coin toss.</comment>This class is about really interesting and important subject matter, but Cutler manages to make everything politicized, which gets frustrating. Granted the information is subjective in some cases, but it is far too biased of a class. Once you get passed Cutler's attitude, its really interesting. That being said, I really liked learning about health care in the US, but wish the level of economics and statistics knowledge assumed was higher. We literally spent an hour and a half learning how to interpret a simple linear regression, which, I don't want to sound snobby, but that was a waste of time.</comment>Painless way to fulfill an Econ writing requirement</comment>Decent course with interesting topic.  Lectures are good, assignments are not always math based, in spite of an EMR designation.</comment>Make sure to do the readings on time. For the weeks that I did skip the readings, I found that I got a lot less out of lecture that I could have otherwise. The readings give you the ability to engage in discussion during lecture and section, and provide a framework for you to build off of.</comment>Though there isn't much work involved during the semester, it's not worth taking.  I really did't get much out of this class, having taken global health classes before.  I wouldn't recommend it to Economics concentrators as there is very little economics involved, and the grading is very confusing.  Helps you get familiar with the health insurance market, however.</comment>it's definitely not a math class and it's hard to figure out what they expect out of you with the problem sets and the tests</comment>Easy to listen to, actually enjoyed lecture! Great was to fulfill an econ elective and actually enjoy the class.</comment>You NEED to take this class if you care even the slightest bit about health, economics, or politics...so basically everyone needs to take this class!</comment>This class is a very easy introduction to healthcare and global health.  The material is pretty interesting, and the lectures are sometimes slow but pretty good anyway.</comment>This is a great class to fulfill a gen ed or if you are just looking for a great class. You will learn a lot of interesting material and professor cutler is a great lecturer.</comment>They baby you on some clear ideas, neglect some that are important on exams, and generally do not run the class well. Yet, lectures were interesting and you can learn a lot from them and Cutler. Also half of the readings are from the New York times haha</comment>This class is very enjoyable, and I loved the fact that the lessons we learned were very applicable to real life.</comment>The subject matter is great and very fascinating; the class was just alright. I didn't feel like I got much out of lecture - mostly just from doing the readings. The class was definitely easy enough, but not as challenging/rigorous as I would have expected.</comment>It's a great class. Not too much of a time commitment, nor is it too difficult. Yet it's still not a time waster, and you will truly learn. It was very interesting (and timely, with Obamacare)!</comment>Ec concentrators - beware that the section of the problem set for ec concentrators is unclear and graded harshly.</comment>The midterm focuses a lot on the readings which are not covered in lecture or really even section so you have to understand those on your own. Really interesting class though and a lot of relevance to current events, especially with what's going in our country right now in regards to healthcare reform.</comment>Professor Cutler is really nice and really smart.  The class is not too difficult but I came away learning a lot about healthcare systems and health insurance.  Really glad I took it.</comment>I found out a hate global health with this class. However, I don't believe it was because this class, just an opinion I discovered during this semester.</comment>Not a lot of work. Very painless USW especially for the more math/science inclined.</comment>This class is actually a really good choice if you're at all interested in health care in the US and covers a good variety of topics. There's some basic math concepts and it's probably really easy if you've taken ec before, but even though I hadn't, it was still easily understandable. Professor Cutler wrote some of the ACA so of course the class is biased towards his own opinions and views but he also does a pretty good job of emphasizing that health care is an extremely complex topic and that no one solution is the best. The lectures can get a bit dry sometimes, and section wasn't super helpful but I enjoyed the class overall, more than I thought I would (I took it for the Global Health secondary and as a gen ed). There're only six problem sets total, one midterm and a final or research paper and other than that, you really don't have to do much work (reading the articles is not necessary as the same things are covered in class). It definitely made me interested in going in to health care in the future.</comment>Just don't take the class. It is not a lot of day to day work at all but unless you are extremely interested in global health and are willing to deal with the random bs they make you put up with it will not be worth your time.</comment>prof cutler had some great lectures and some boring lectures - it's the type of class where you get out what you put into it. that said, the material was engaging, and even though I didn't have the head TF (who was apparently amazing in section) I still somewhat benefitted from the section component.</comment>Attend lectures so you know the focus of the course. The readings are moderate but won't be helpful if you don't know the key takeaways of the lecture.</comment>The grading is super arbitrary. Didn't feel like I got any feedback on my assignments or midterm, which made me decide to write the final paper instead of take the final exam. The class has a light course load which was nice, but I'm not sure I would take this class again due to the arbitrary grading.</comment></course>HIST 1992: Disease and Public Health in Modern East Asian History</title>do the readings. this class only had 7 people in it so there's no faking/bsing if you don't do the readings. The professor is awesome and super engaging not only on an academic level but also just in a real way. He's not afraid to bring up injustices that are currently occurring and talk about them even if it's a tangent from the class discussion.</comment></course>APMTH 205: Advanced Scientific Computing: Numerical Methods</title>Important class - you learn the important methods</comment>4/5 difficulty, ~10-15 hours per pset  This was actually a pretty good course for numerical methods. It's pretty well-taught, and Prof. Rycroft gives good explanations for all the math behind the algorithms. The slides are also excellent and help clarify things when lecture is hard to follow. Beware of the homework assignments. They can take a surprisingly long time, especially because bugs in numerical algorithms are extremely frustrating. Be very careful while writing code and be sure to check all the little pieces, and watching out for pass-by-reference things. If you can, start early because debugging is very frustrating. Despite struggling on the psets, I actually liked this class and felt like I learned quite a bit from it.</comment>If you like coding functions that have already been written in Python or MATLAB then AM 205 is for you. If you'd rather take a class where the material you learn will be applicable later on in life, then find another course.</comment>You must be extremely confident with PDEs to take this course. It is tough and if your not prepared you will not be able to complete the assignments.</comment>Material is so important and enjoyable</comment>Time consuming, but teaches good subjects</comment>It's a manageable course that covers a good amount of material on ODE, regression, interpolation, lin alg, and spectral analysis. The course is very much applied and focused around programming, with proofs as necessary. The course emphasizes breadth over depth.</comment>This course is pretty interesting, but not sure how applicable the methods are.</comment>You learn a lot of good stuff!</comment>This course provides a broad introduction to fundamental concepts in applied mathematics. I found it valuable, though the lectures were fast paced. Therefore, I recommend supplementing Chris' lectures with those from the previous year, when the course was taught by David Knezevic (videos available online). If you have studied mathematics or physics formally, this course will not be too much of a challenge. If you come from another discipline, or have not seen the prerequisite material in a while, this may be difficult, but definitely still doable.</comment>fun class.</comment>This class is quite challenging. A lot of material is covered very quickly. Be prepared to spend a lot of time on assignments and expect to get little to no sleep during the 24 hour midterm. You learn a lot of useful stuff though.</comment></course>MUSIC 189r: Chamber Music Performance</title>This was by far one of my favorite classes of the semester: I would strongly recommend this class to anyone interested in playing some chamber music at a high level.</comment>The Parker Quartet is one of the best things that have ever happened to chamber music at Harvard! They are phenomenal and articulate, supportive and kind and generous (although they could afford to be a bit tougher and a bit more authoritative).</comment>This is a great way to continue playing classical music at a high level, with fantastic instruction, in a relatively stress-free environment. If you're a pianist: be ready to power through a lot of music very fast; pieces are long and tough, and you're expected to play the entire piece at performance level, not just a movement. I highly recommend this class- I met a lot of great people through it, and got to interact with one of the best chamber groups in the country- the Parker Quartet.</comment>It is a wonderful experience to make music with a handful of fine musicians. Chamber music is the best.</comment>An opportunity to experience chamber music of an extremely high caliber, as well as become part of a close community.</comment>I absolutely loved this class.  The community and musicianship are unparalleled, and I can't wait to sign up for another semester!  The coaches are all extremely talented and down-to-earth, the peer group is really inspiring, and the low pressure atmosphere means this class doesn't even feel like work.</comment>This class is essentially determined by how much time and effort you put in. You can choose to put in as little or as much time as you want, but ultimately you set your own expectations for your chamber group. The coachings can be very valuable depending on your instructor.</comment>I had an enormous amount of fun throughout the semester in 189. Working with the Parker Quartet was extremely rewarding, and the coachings were great. Of course, much of my enjoyment of the course probably derives from my being placed in a chamber group I liked, so if you're interested, try to find a good chamber group beforehand.</comment>The opportunity to work with members of the Parker Quartet was a wonderful opportunity. This is definitely a class in which you get as much out of the class as you put into it.</comment>This course is one of the most hands-on of the music courses here and is informative even for beginner-level musicians</comment>Choose group members beforehand who are committed and willing to practice and cooperate. Score study, talk about how you intend to shape phrases, record yourself to hear if these intentions are legible. Don't wait until mid semester to learn the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th mvmts, start early.</comment>It's helpful to form a group beforehand. Definitely a great experience, and I would take it again.</comment>If you would like to have fun playing chamber music and work hard to polish your piece, this is the class from you.</comment>The Parker Quartet is fantastic, Heng-Jin is fantastic, the course is fantastic. TAKE IT</comment></course>PSY 980o: Perception and Imagination</title>Justin does an amazing job of teaching the material. It might seem like the material is a bit dry, but he does a really good job of making the material stuff you could really engage with through discussion with your classmates. Plus, he buys delicious snacks for every class.</comment>Professor Junge was fantastic. The course deals with some pretty difficult topics, but Justin makes them digestible and fascinating. It ended up being one of my favorite courses. Loved the small class atmosphere. Great class if you have any interest in the material. You will take away so much from the course!!</comment>if you have any interest in knowing underlying mechanisms and current frontiers and conceptions of how we see the world, both literally and figuratively, then it's worth it to take this class. light workload, tranquil sections</comment></course>AESTH&INTP 13: Cultural Agents</title>If you're interested in what impact the arts can have on the world -- whether hopeful or skeptical that they can -- take this class! It's a great survey of the major theories of art as an agent of social change. Lectures can be a bit meandering and sometimes a bit boring, but it's generally worth it for some really cool guest speakers, and cool hands on cultural agency workshops that Prof Sommer facilities (Pre-Texts and Forum Theater). Jeronimo is an amazing TF, and can cut through some of the pretty dense reading quickly to just make it clearer. Because the class has a weekly response paper, it can be a moderate bit of work depending on how much time you put in, but grading is generally very kind (note to the teaching staff: please keep it that way!)</comment>interesting class that could be more organized</comment>This class will get you to think deeply about how art can be an effective measure to change the world. I can honestly say that I look at every protest, every movement, and every intervention through the lens provided in this class. I always the questions that this class asked of me. As far as class content goes, response papers are pretty low-key for interacting with the material and fairly useful for formulating your own ideas. I definitely echo everyone else that says prepare for the final project early. Basically just start thinking about it as the class goes on. Come in with an open mind to this class - some days are more believable than others for sure.</comment>This is a great class in which, if you apply yourself, you will learn a great deal and finish the semester with a huge inventory of political theories and philosophies under your belt. If you pay attention and actually think about some of the issues discussed, I feel that this class can be really engaging. With that being said, it is a very manageable time commitment, and though the first lecture may seem monotonous, stay for at least a couple more-- it's a great class; trust me, you should take it.</comment>Want to have a quacky time with quacky ideas and gnarly people. This is the class for you. But jokes aside, this class opened the idea of initiatives of cultural agency to impact social change and how culture and art can be used as a complimentary force to drive change you may desire.</comment>All the good that this class brought - giving us a better understanding of aesthetic theory etc - was counteracted by the terrible spacing and grading scheme of the assignments.  Also the guest lecturers were boring and irrelevant.  The professor and TF seemed to place high stakes on everything and in the process lost the trust of the students.</comment>Do the readings, go to lecture, and verify what the expectations are</comment>The class is conceptually interesting, but fails in execution.  The guest lectures are disorganized, the readings dont align with what's talked about in class, and the class is much more theoretical than I initially thought.  I think the course load is incredibly manageable and one of the lightest you'll find in gen-ed, If that is worth sitting in lectures that aren't always engaging and not getting as much out of the class as you might in another gen-ed that's up to you.</comment>This class is pretty interesting and has a low workload. It's a painless way to fulfill the AIU Gen Ed if that's what you want. Also, if you put in a decent amount of effort, you should get an A.</comment>This class is very interesting, albeit a little bit disorganized. The term project is actually really fun and super rewarding!</comment>As of right now, this course is an easy way to fill a gen-ed, but it’s a totally waste of time. I did not enjoy a single lecture. If you want to have a gut class, this is it. If you actually want to engage with your AIU class, don’t take this one.</comment>If you're looking for a highly interactive course about art and social intervention, this is it.</comment>I shopped Cultural Agents, as a figured it would be an easy way to fulfill a gen-ed requirement. As the semester progressed, I actually began to enjoy the course. The readings were great and the discussions really opened my eyes to the idea of social intervention. The guest speakers were also great. That said, most of the students in the course had no idea what was going on. The class is terribly disorganized and expectations are not really discussed. For example, students participate in a "map project" in the middle of the semester. We were barely told what we were supposed to do, and our TF couldn't seem to get answers from the professors/head TF. We were also told it wasn't going to be graded... but after we turned it in, we were told it was, in fact, going to be assigned a grade. 

If you are looking for a gen-ed that doesn't take up too much time and you're willing to deal with a lack of organization and professors that babble on for a long time without saying much, you may find AI13 enjoyable.</comment>This is an amazing class! Also great to fulfill a gen ed</comment>If you're looking for an easy A&I class, this is your answer. It's essentially just a 300 word response paper each week for which you don't even need to do the readings, an easy midterm, and a final project. The teaching staff is also really nice and very passionate about the course material. The downside is that the class is rather poorly organized - expectations for assignments and projects are vague and aren't well communicated. All told, you probably won't get a ton out of the class, but it will be a relatively painless, if not somewhat enjoyable, way to satisfy your A&I requirement.</comment>Great course, if you are looking for a project-based class and want to be more creative in your coursework. For this course, you really get what what you put in.</comment>It's super laid back yet informative.</comment>Even though this class is easy grade-wise, you will suffer for taking it.  Some interest in art and aesthetics definitely helps.  The professors are fairly incompetent.  Most of the time you cannot understand what Francesco is muttering and Doris is a bit too eccentric.  The readings are too dense and no one actually reads them.  However, Rob is a great TF!  He helped so much in explaining the concepts and connecting everything together.  In general, the course suffers from its lack of organization.  While guest lectures were interesting, they don't connect to the course.  The professors don't seem to prepare too much for their own lectures and the guest lectures.  Doris even fell asleep during two guest lectures.  In addition, there was apparently a joint collaboration between this course and CS50, but other than a mention during the first lecture, the effort was non-exist.  As a STEM concentrator, I found myself frustrated by all the wishy-washiness of this course.  You're stuck with a bunch of humanities concentrators who, along with the professors, seem to just be making things up half of the time.  So if you want an easy grade, take the class.  But know that you will be frustrated by it every day and that you will question yourself on why you chose it.</comment>Great class that makes you think of "change" in a different way.</comment>Try not to get bogged down by the not-so-great logistics in this class. The ideas are still valuable and use the final project as an opportunity in your life to do something that will actually change society.</comment>Don't get fooled on the first day of class is less about case studies of cultural initiatives but more about aesthetic philosophers</comment>Make sure you have an idea of what you are doing for your final project.</comment>You will learn in this class if you have a good section leader (Rob Fox). Low work load during the semester, but high work load at the end.</comment>Awesome and very do-able class!</comment>There is a lot more assignments and work than you would expect, especially at the end of the semester.</comment>This class was a wonderful way to explore the arts through so many different lenses and through the medium of innovation and social change. As a science concentrator, I was worried about completing the A&I GenEd. I am so glad I took this class, though! I learned so much through it.</comment>I would most definitely tell them to pay attention to the material. Although the lectures may not be the best indicators of how great the course is, I definitely benefited a lot from paying attention to the material and wanting to dive deeper into each theorist.</comment></course>ITAL C: Intermediate Italian: Romance! Mystery? Noir...</title>You're Italian will definitely improve, but be ready to put in a fair amount of work if learning another language does not come naturally to you. There will be more work some weeks than others, so just be prepared to be flexible.</comment>This is a very interactive class with room to make mistakes, fix them, and learn from them for the future.</comment>This could be a good course but it lacks structure and a lot of the assignments are made up as the course goes on. That being said, it is a decent review of Italian if you want to continue into higher level Italian</comment></course>SPANSH 30: Advanced Spanish Language I: Four Countries and their Cultures</title>This class is a great way for you to further your language skills. It is different from Spanish C and earlier classes in that it delves much deeper into the historical and cultural backgrounds of the four different countries, and the guest speakers and extra events adds a nice touch to the class as well. It was great to look at so many different artworks, music, social and political movements, and historical events that provided a real context to many of the themes and ideas we were learning.</comment>Spanish 30 was a great way for me to expose myself to the language after not having taken it for years. Perfect combination of breadth and depth! Be prepared for daily work, but it's really manageable if you stay on top of it.</comment>This class requires daily work but not more than an hour. It is really interesting because you get to learn about four different cultures through literature, music, film and food.</comment>The experience in the class will be shaped by your section leader so spend time choosing who will work best for you</comment>If you intend to pursue a citation in Spanish or are very comfortable with the language, this is a fine class. However, if it is your first foreign language class at Harvard, you should perhaps consider dropping down a level to get used to the workload and the intensity. It is not the same as a high school level language class.</comment>This is a really great course! It's very similar in structure to Spanish C, but the grammar topics are a little harder and require more studying for the exams. That said, you can definitely do well in the course by keeping up with the grammar outside of class, and exams are very fair. Additionally, I found lessons and assignments to be interesting. Andrés is great!</comment>Be aware that you do have to use the book a lot if you want to succeed on the test. Section isn't really for learning grammar, but more for practicing it through speaking and discussing course materials.</comment>Carolina is incredible, if you want to get better at spanish you really have to apply yourself to this class, while you can also just kind of float through without improving or doing poorly.</comment>It is a very fun, engaging class that both improves your grammar and your wrting/speaking skills</comment>I loveeeeddd this class!! Carolina was amazing!! I think the course can be really awesome but it all depends on who your professor is. The material is interesting (especially the part on food) and the assignments are straight forward and challenging but not difficult.. Great course!</comment>Really interesting topic on four Latin American countries.  It is not very difficult, but you need to know Spanish.</comment>Andres is a great teacher. My Spanish improved tremendously and I am extremely satisfied with my experience in the class. That being said, I like Spanish very much and wanted to learn it. It is important that you care about learning the language in order to enjoy the class.</comment>I thought this class gave me a good review and refinement of my knowledge of Spanish grammar.  The assignments and assessments were helpful to learning and generally quite reasonable in terms of time and effort needed.  The course this year included reading a Spanish-language short novel, and while this was very helpful for improving reading and vocabulary, incoming students should know they will likely have to budget significantly more time for reading the novel than they do for the other assignments.  The reading assignments for the novel seemed to be a bit longer than the other reading assignments given in the course, the vocabulary seemed more difficult to decipher, and one's level of comprehension needed to be higher for the novel reading assignments than for the assignments for the other texts, as each novel reading assignment, of course, built upon the information from the last reading.</comment>Spanish 30 is a great class to take if you're interested in learning more about the cultures of several Spanish-speaking countries. Although grammar is definitely still covered, it is not the focus of the class, which made it more enjoyable than some other Spanish classes I've taken in the past.</comment>It's a great course! You get to learn a lot about other cultures through fun and interesting approaches i.e. music videos, food, novels, news articles, documentaries, movies, etc. Plus, my listening and speaking skills improved incredibly.</comment>It is a really interesting course that focuses on the cultural exploration of four spanish speaking countries while developing some grammar and language skills along the way.</comment>This class is good because it focuses on both speaking/listening and reading/writing, but keep in mind that a lot of the material that you talk about is on South American culture and history, which may be interesting to some, but wasn't really what I expected out of the class.</comment>Practice your spanish speaking as much as possible in class</comment>This is a good class to take if you want to solidify grammar rules and learn about Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru.</comment>Maria was a fantastic teacher and to try and be in her section.</comment>Definitely need prior Spanish experience. Helps less with improving conversational ability</comment>It was one of the few classes in which I had a lot of fun while learning.</comment>Take this class if you want to practice your speaking skills.</comment>I recommend this class. I learned a lot about Latin American culture.</comment>Spanish 30 is a fun language course, especially if you have Andres as your professor. The chance to incorporate food, music and literature into the study of a language was always exciting and fun.</comment>While it was a fun experience overall, I will admit that it was much more demanding than I had imagined at the beginning of the year. It was also my first Spanish class since senior year of high school and I am a sophomore, so there was definitely the element of challenge. Papers are graded harshly to get you ready for more rigorous Spanish classes afterwards.</comment>Spanish is gr888888888.</comment>Fun class in which you have plenty of practice improving your spanish fluency.</comment>Great continuation after Spanish c.</comment>Good solid intermediate-level Spanish class.</comment>This course made me so much more aware of the varying cultures and dialects between the Spanish-speaking countries.</comment>This is a really well designed course and you will learn a lot about the four countries while also having the opportunity to practice your Spanish speaking skills.  How much you end up enjoying the course probably comes down a lot to your teacher and your classmates.  My teacher, José Ángel de Leon Gonzalez, was fantastic.  He was interesting, approachable, and overall just a great person to get to know.  He spent a ton of time writing out constructive feedback on everything we turned in, and corrected us when we spoke in class without making us feel inferior.  I had the chance to speak in Spanish every day in that class, and I never felt intimidated.</comment>Take this class if you want to get better at spanish, in all components. It is alot of material covered at a fast pace, but you will end up feeling like you truly got better at spanish.</comment>If you have taken spanish before this course is a great way to brush up on what you have learned and to reinforce grammar rules. It is also a fun way to learn about 4 countries Latin American counties.</comment>The class moves too quickly for any depth in the grammar portion, which is the only thing that is tested in this course.  If you want to only care about grammar in Spanish, this is the class for you.</comment>In highschool I was able to get by without being very good at speaking but these class sizes make it much more difficult to do that. You get pushed out of your comfort zone but I definitely got better at spanish.</comment>This class does not have a heavy workload, but can be difficult if you lack the necessary Spanish background. The exams test grammar and vocabulary that is mostly learned outside of class. I took Spanish 30 even though a lower level was suited for me. I learned a lot through immersion and my Spanish significantly improved, but I was disappointed with my performance on exams.</comment>It was a great class to learn about the culture of numerous countries, and even to begin to break down some standard literature. However, a solid knowledge of Spanish grammar is definitely needed, and maybe some background in writing essays in spanish.</comment></course>LATIN 112a: History of Latin Literature I</title>If you feel that you have holes in your knowledge of early Latin literature, then this course is for you. It provides a great foundation for those students planning to write theses about Latin literature or those students considering graduate school in Classics.</comment>This class is amazing. You read so much material in one semester that it is mind blowing. With this being said, you do read about 600 lines a week, which is a ton to translate in one week, and the workload can pile up if you start slacking off. So the trick to the class is to really stay on top of your work. Being really good/fast at translating Latin really helps, but you can pull through if you are decent. Professor Tarrant is fantastic and really gets you to appreciate the texts of Catullus, Lucretius, Horace, Virgil and many others. I do recommend this course, just be prepared for hard-working semester.</comment>I haven't taken the others, but I do get the sense that Latin 112a is the best of all of the 112 level classes. A fun class, and with subject matter including Lucretius, Virgil, and Horace! It's also exciting to read Propertius and Ovid toward the end in close succession. The section translating helps you make sure you are understanding these texts carefully, and it is conducted in a helpful way.</comment>Take this only if you need to for your concentration, or if you anticipate an easy semester in other classes and are genuinely interested in Latin literature</comment>This class can be a bear at times because of the sheer amount of reading assigned - that being said, the insight and focus on every author is unlike what you will find anywhere else. More important, though, is the context in which you'll experience each of them, because the attention to the growth and evolution of Latin as a literary language is huge and, at least for this period, can only be found in this class.</comment>Professor Tarrant is amazing. 112 is a challenging course, but Professor Tarrant makes it worthwhile. He knows so much and makes amazing connections across texts. He chooses texts specifically so that comparisons can be made and you get more than one look at, e.g., drama. (Seriously, if not this course, take a course, any course, with Professor Tarrant.) The biggest challenge of the course is the quantity of Latin, not the quality of Latin. There are a few texts that are difficult (hi Lucretius!), but mostly you get into a rhythm and you're fine (if you can commit the time; it is a time commitment). The final was much more challenging than the midterm so be prepared for that. The essays are short and doable. Section can feel like a pain because it's yet another hour, but it is helpful to go over some of the Latin in depth and to make sure you're getting it.</comment></course>LING 106: Knowledge of Meaning</title>If you really enjoy open-ended, theoretical lectures that do not lead anywhere but just pose existential questions and you enjoy working with syntactical structures and semantical denotations, then this will be a very interesting class for you. The lectures will be unrelated to the homework and you will not cover everything on the handouts in detail, so either you need to self-study a lot or just have an intuitive sense of what is going on beforehand. Great for linguistics concentrators, not so great for everyone else.</comment>Not a great first linguistics course to take. The material is super interesting, but it's pretty disorganized and the teaching is variable. If you're already interested in linguistics, though, it's cool.</comment></course>CULTR&BLF 34: Madness and Medicine: Themes in the History of Psychiatry</title>This is a great class! Keeping track how the different thematic chunks relate to the overall timeline is kind of confusing sometimes. Lectures are really interesting though and Prof Harrington REALLY knows her stuff. If you have any interest in mental health, this is a great way to contextualize where we are today -- it's crazy how much of how we think about mental health seems rooted in a time we think we are so far past. Section can be hit and miss depending upon your TF</comment>This is a really interesting class, especially if you are interested in psychiatry, but it is a lot of reading and a lot of work, so make sure you're interested in the topic.</comment>CB34 is great. I don't think I know a single student in the class who didn't thoroughly enjoy the material. Although I am not a history student, I was actually attentive for at least 95% of the actual class time, which is record breaking for me. Professor Harrington is absolutely excellent and is a very compassionate person. In class, she is highly engaging, and, outside of class, she is incredibly approachable. I would recommend this class in a heartbeat.</comment>This is a great class. Don't get behind on the readings, as they'll come to haunt you, though they really haven't seemed to be necessary to do most of the assignments (note, I haven't taken the final yet), but they're pretty interesting nonetheless.</comment>Lots of reading thats important for section. Lectures are interesting and engaging for people of all interests. Only one midterm that was relatively easy, with a final that was not cumulative. Two papers that were short and easy</comment>This course is very helpful in understanding historical as well as very contemporary debates about mental health (in America) because it addresses issues ranging from the 19th century up to Adderall and modern day genetic research. The work load is not heavy and most of the material is very straightforward. Overall, I enjoyed this course a lot.</comment>The material for this course was unbelievable, and it has shaped my modern-day understanding of our world and its stigmas more than any other class at Harvard. The course is not a lot of work on a weekly basis, but be prepared to invest time and energy into the essays.</comment>Harrington is a great and engaging lecturer. If you're at all interested in psychiatry/mental illness this will be an awesome and pretty easy class. There are a lot of busy-work assignments but you learn so much over the course of the semester none of them are that hard.</comment>Definitely one of the most interesting classes I have taken at Harvard.  Professor Harrington gives great lectures, and the TF's are all deeply interested in the subject matter and really convey the passion that they have about the course.  Not as easy as some of the other CB courses, but definitely not a stressful class.</comment>This is an amazing class. Anne Harrington is one of the best lecturers that I have had at Harvard.</comment>Professor Harrington's a very passionate lecturer and really cares about the material deeply. However, I was expecting the course to be a little more science-y - the course is basically a history course about science. And history of science is something that I don't find particularly interesting. Also, make sure you talk to your TF EARLY about the research paper.</comment>Take it for Anne</comment>This was pretty low stress and low time commitment. It was also very interesting and section was useful in terms of reviewing the material.</comment>absolutely amazing course. a must take. easy, learn soooo much, so great.</comment>Kind of tough that there was a final research paper and a final exam, but other than that not too overwhelming for a gen ed.</comment>An amazing course!! Take if you have the chance.</comment>It is a well-structured course that does not demand a significant amount of time while also permitting flexibility for you to explore your interests within psychiatry.</comment>FANTASTIC! A complicated and fascinating topic presented in a manageable and stimulating way! Take it!!!</comment>This was an incredible class.  Take it if you can.  Dr. Harrington is the best lecturer I've ever had, it's very little work, and you'll come out a better person.</comment>This class discusses a serious topic in great detail but the material is presented in an amusing and thought provoking way. Harrington is an excellent lecturer.</comment>Professor Harrington is any amazing, engaging, and compassionate lecturer. I would highly recommend this class for anyone interested in how views about psychiatry have changed over time and how they continue to influence current practices and likely will influence the future. It It also will lead you to reevaluate how you view what is normal or abnormal through this thought provoking course.</comment>The class is great. However, the exams are somewhat harshly graded. You really have to keep up with the reading to understand what is going on, and doing so enhances the experience. The papers are also quite self-explanatory and not very challenging. All in all, you get a lot out of this class without it being too much stress.</comment>This is a fantastic course! Whether or not you are interested in psychiatry before enrolling in this course, by the end of it you will realize how large of a role it plays in society. The lectures are really interesting, the teaching staff is very supportive, and the class is not too much work. Overall, I am very glad I took this course!</comment>TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!!! By far the most interesting course I've taken at Harvard, and Professor Harrington is a delightfully kind, incredibly intelligent mentor. Do not miss a chance to learn about an incredibly interesting topic with one if the best professors Harvard has to offer!!!!!!</comment>This is an awesome class! It's incredibly interesting. With that being said, there is a significant amount of work. There are weekly readings, two papers, a midterm and a final. Though one could definitely get away with not doing the readings, its useful for your papers and to contextualize the material taught in class. The midterm was not difficult, but it was intimidating because I had no idea what to expect on it. The structure was clearly explained to us, but I wasn't sure which terms would be more likely to be an ID than others. If you do take the class, get started working on your papers early! Get feedback from your TFs when you have an outline or idea.</comment>it is a good way to fulfill a gened requirement</comment>Good lectures, clear outline, fun to study.</comment>This class is amazing. Take it. Anne Harrington is one of the best lecturers at Harvard
.</comment>This class is excellent. Doesn't matter if you need the CB or not--I didn't--take it anyway. I think this is one of the best classes I have taken. I had no idea about the history of psychiatry at all, and it really surprised me how fast is has been, and how far we still have to go. Every lecture is so engaging that you want to go. This course does not feel like "work" but rather learning because you can.</comment>This gen-ed course covers really interesting and meaningful material, but requires more work than the majority of gen-ed courses in my opinion. Additionally, I felt like this class had grade deflation. My section leader told us that the majority of students received Bs on the midterm papers because the TFs felt like they needed "to teach freshman a lesson". As a senior taking my last gen-ed, I felt like my paper was graded unfairly because of this objective. Other than grade deflation and numerous assignments, it's an interesting course.</comment>Take this course only if you have a legitimate interest in psychiatry. If you don't, then there may be times in the classes when you ask yourself "Why am I here?" If you do take this class, then try and keep up with the readings. You don't have to read all the material methodically but try to get the main points out based on the lecture slides. NEVER ABANDON THE READING!!!!!! You will screw yourself on the exam especially when questions ask for references to the reading material. Actively pay attention in class or you will find yourselves drifting on cloud 9.</comment>For a gen ed, the coursework is on the heavier side.</comment>This is a good introduction course if you are interested in psychology and good for Freshmen. The lectures are interesting, but the sections are pretty disorganized and the sections as a whole are too big to really get many questions answered there. There's a lot of information that is given out and not much opportunity to discuss it.</comment>Don't miss a lecture!!</comment>This class is AMAZING! Professor Harrington is a great lecturer and is extremely available by email and office hours to discuss course material and help with paper assignments. This class takes you through hundreds of years of psychiatry in such a comprehensive way that by the end of the course, you have a clear picture of how we arrived at the current state of psychiatry.</comment>A fairly straightforward history course. There aren't that many instances where they teach you how to think and write like a historian (but you are assigned to think and write like one), so the class is mostly what you put into it.</comment>Awesome class. Prof. Harrington gives great lectures and the readings and subject matter are captivating.</comment>This is an interesting and painless way to fulfill your Culture and Belief gen ed.  I was genuinely interested in the subject matter, and the course was easy enough that I could genuinely enjoy it as well.  Take this class!</comment>The course is not very demanding and it is an interesting course to take to fulfill the Culture and Belief requirement.</comment>Very interesting material, fairly easy GenEd, well taught. The course focuses on Europe in the 19th century and the US in the 20th. Prof. Harrington is an excellent lecturer and a devoted teacher.</comment>It's a pretty low time commitment, except for the two papers. But the material is super interesting so you'll actually enjoy lectures (if you go) and possibly enjoy studying for the exams. The professor is a great lecturer!</comment>I really enjoyed this class! You leave this course with a comprehensive understanding of the history of psychiatry. The work load is manageable, lectures were incredibly interesting, and the teaching staff is always willing to meet with you.</comment>It's dedinitely a course for people who are interested in psychiatry. If you're just looking for a gem, I moght look elsewhere. It all depends on who you are, really.</comment>This course is great if you are interested in the history of psychiatry. It is a relatively easy CB requirement, however, you will have both a final paper and final exam so keep that in mind when choosing which CB you want to take.</comment>Take this class. The material is amazing, the lectures are interesting. And section is fun.</comment>This is an overall great class - the only issue is that with the research paper and final it seems like a lot of work, especially if you have very challenging classes, but if you keep up with the readings, the final shouldn't be that bad.</comment>This course is WONDERFUL. You will learn a lot of history, and Professor Harrington is a very dynamic and engaging lecturer.</comment>This is a very fair class. There is a good deal of work, but it is very doable and you get so much out of it. I would absolutely take this class. Professor Harrington is an amazing lecturer, and I can honestly say that this class was life-changing.</comment>This is a great Gen Ed class! Lectures are engaging, Professor Harrington is wonderful, and the course is structured well.</comment>It's great but it might be more work than you expect it to be, especially at the end of the semester.</comment>Very fun gen-ed course, that satisfies all the boxes a student would want to check when finding a gen-ed: surprisingly interesting and relevant material, passionate professor and excellent teaching staff, moderate workload and engaging assignments. I had no interest in psychiatry going into the course but in hindsight I would advise all students to check it out during reading week.</comment>The lectures are very interesting.</comment>This class was a lot more work than I expected.  The grading was also harsher than I expected.  Lectures are interesting and if you are looking for a P/F class this could be good.  I took this as a 4th class and it was a mistake!</comment>This is an awesome C&B gen ed! It's super interesting material, not a big workload (depending on your TF you can probably get away with not doing a lot of the readings), and Anne Harrington is a great lecturer. It's a really cool and relevant subject you probably wouldn't learn about in any other setting besides a college course, and if you need C&B I would totally recommend.</comment>This is a gen ed that you'll be glad you took</comment>I strongly recommend this course to any student who is interested in the history of science, mental health policy, or psychology!  The lectures are engaging and the source materials are consistently interesting.</comment>My favorite course this semester. Anne Harrington is an extremely engaging and thoughtful lecturer - and person. It is both a blessing and curse that this class is so large - glad that it is not lotteried, but would have really appreciated having more opportunities to get to know Professor Harrington outside of rushed 15 minute office hours. 

Whether or not you are a pre-med and whether or not you have an interest in psychiatry, do not hesitate for a moment to take this course. It will amaze and astound you - and give you an appreciation for and understanding of the contentious field of psychiatry.</comment>This is a pretty standard lecture course, with interesting subject material. You learn about the history of psychology from a lot of different angles and in a lot of different contexts. The essay assignments are pretty open-ended, so you can pick something that you're interested in to research. There's a final paper AND a final exam, so that's kind of brutal.</comment>Interesting, but exams are weighted disproportionately</comment>This course is good to give students basic knowledge, but it is a little slow.</comment>Anne Harrington is awesome and the material is very interesting.</comment>This is a wonderful class. It is not too much work and is very interesting. The lectures were great and I learned a lot through the course. All in all, a great GenEd.</comment>This is the best course I've taken at Harvard (currently a Junior). The material in this course covers a history of mental health that is still unraveling today, which is therefore a highly vibrant and relevant history.</comment>This course was awesome!  It's a really interesting look into the history of psychiatry that doesn't get lost in the details or skim over too much.</comment>This is a great class and there's a lot of material to cover.  Prof. Harrington does a great job making the course into a story, which makes it very entertaining.</comment>This course is challenging and thought provoking without being stressful. I enjoyed and even looked forward to going to lectures, and section was ALWAYS useful and interesting, which is rare. I would absolutely recommend.</comment>There is not much work required, but make sure to do the readings.</comment>This is an awesome course! Harrington is an amazing lecturer, the readings are interesting, and the assignments are flexible, allowing you to focus on what you think is captivating. Also, you will learn how much more complex the history of psychiatry (and medicine) really is. This course is what I think the Gen Ed program is trying to accomplish.</comment>Professor Harrington is the sweetest,always ready to reach out and help her students. Even for a Gen Ed, the material is fascinating and the class doesn't have more work than you can handle. Section had very thought-provoking discussions. TAKE IT!</comment>The class is a fun and easy introduction to classes based on the field of History of Science.</comment>This class is a pretty good way to fulfill the CB Gen Ed. Professor Harrington is a great lecturer and really cares about her students. We also had two fantastic guest lecturers with former NIMH president Steve Hyman and author Elyn Saks. But I don't think that it is the easiest Gen Ed ever. The readings can be long and kind of unnecessary, and you have a short essay, a midterm, a long research paper, and a final, which is kind of a lot for a Gen Ed. But with some sort of background in English or History it is completely manageable.</comment>They will find the course find this course fascinating, and make sure to complete the readings consistently.  It is much easier to digest the content in pieces rather than right before the exam.</comment>This is a great, interesting class! Definitely best way to fulfill CB!</comment>Very interesting topic and fun to learn</comment>Take it! CB34 is a great course and you get to learn so much about how psychiatry has developed over the years.</comment>Not too much work but the tests are graded hard.</comment>Take this course if you have absolutely any interest in the subject matter. While it is all about the past, it has great relevance to the present day. Take this course!</comment>Love Prof. Harrington! She is very passionate about very interesting material and it shows when she teaches. Great gen-ed!</comment>Great Gen. Ed! Easy workload and very interesting lectures.</comment>Professor Harrington is extremely knowledgeable in the subject and covers a lot of material very quickly but, because of that, you need to be prepared to study a lot for exams. Although this is a gen ed, it has a lot of assignments (source analysis paper, midterm, final exam and final paper) so you need to invest a lot of time. Overall, it is a great class, definitely recommend! If you are lucky to get Yvan as your TF, you will have a blast. He's the best.</comment>This is a wonderful course about an extremely relevant topic to today's society. It opens your eyes to the historical development of a fascinating field, and you walk away having truly learned a great deal. As a senior, this was without a doubt one of the most interesting and well-taught classes I have taken here at Harvard.</comment>This course is riveting; I cannot think of any reason why you wouldn't take it.</comment>Professor Harrington is amazing and makes the class worth taking, but the workload is not as light as the Q guide makes it out to be.</comment>This is probably the best gen ed I've taken.  The material is fascinating, the professor is articulate, dedicated, and engaging, and the work load is pretty light.  Although there are three "essays," the first is a warm-up assignment, and the second is just a short close reading; it's really only the third - the research paper - that's a significant amount of work.  The in-class midterm and final are both straightforward; they're just to make sure you've done enough of the readings and been to enough lectures to know the overarching themes and the important details.</comment>Right now, I am considering a career as a clinical psychologist, and this course was really helpful in coming to a better understanding of how therapy and drugs have evolved as treatments over the years, both in conjunction and separately.  It was fascinating to learn how understandings of mental illness has changed over time, as well as the future directions of the field.  There is no textbook for the course--just primary and secondary source readings, which I thought was an interesting, albeit necessary, approach, as the kind of ideas which Prof. Harrington is exploring have not yet been codified into one coherent voice.  Overall, a great class!</comment>This is a very interesting course if psychiatry, medicine, or history interests you.  Prof. Harrington is a wonderful lecturer and she makes it very interesting.  I would take this class if you have any interest.  Wythe is a great TF if he is still around.</comment>I didn't like the class throughout, but realized that it actually was sufficiently interesting upon studying for the final. Don't let the incohesive lectures and excessive readings deter you from learning the broad themes.</comment>Take this course if you have the opportunity! It's only offered every other year, so I highly encourage you to take the class if it's offered this semester! Professor Harrington is brilliant and extremely knowledgeable, and the TFs are great at guiding you through the subject matter. You will learn so much about the origins of psychiatry, the various movements that influenced psychiatry, and mental health more broadly from a political, cultural, biological and ethical perspective. I only wish I had been able to take this course earlier, because I would have definitely pursued history and science as a concentration or secondary field of study...life-changing, truly. Take it.</comment>This class is amazing! Prof. Harrington is such an amazing lecturer and very nice and helpful! The lectures are very interesting.  Having a final essay and exam was somewhat stressful, and there are quite a few readings, but they are all manageable.</comment>Anne is great</comment>This really was a good class. A lot of people complained because there was a final paper and a final exam but honestly it wasn't that bad. 

My roommate hated her TF and said she was very annoyingly particular about answers. I on the other hand had a wonderful TF (Kit) and really enjoyed section.

Prof Harrington is really very knowledgeable about the topic and very available to students. I'd definitely recommend this one if you are at all interested in the topic.</comment>I loved this class because it really got me excited about History of Science. It really taught me a lot about the underlying beliefs in our culture today.</comment>your TF has a lot to do with how much you will enjoy this class. The professor is very accessible and helpful!</comment>I would not buy the sourcebook. many of the readings are online or available in the library, and oftentimes you can get buy without it</comment>This is such a fascinating class, and great introduction to the history of science, specifically to the realm of psychiatry. Professor Harrington is so great, and lectures are awesome!</comment>This class is amazing, maybe the best one I've ever taken</comment>This is one of the best courses I have taken at Harvard. Professor Harrington really engages people and cares about helping all of us learn and interacting with the students. We would clap after each of her lectures because we all really appreciated her enthusiasm.</comment>Be ready to be surprised to learn a few things you may never have considered before!</comment>Awesome class! Prof Harrington is a great lecturer, material is interesting, and you feel like you learn a lot without ever being stressed by the amount of material.</comment>Very well-organized, strong support structure. If you are looking for a gen ed which rewards you with knowledge for the hard work that you put in, this is the gem!</comment>This is a fantastic CB, and just a fantastic course in general. Prof Harrington is a great lecturer, and the readings are really interesting. I loved the questions that the course raises about the ethics of psychiatry and the question of the patient experience, and the memoirs you read are also so interesting. My biggest suggestion would be to do all the readings and go to lectures. It's really worth it (and it's easy not to do either of those things).</comment>This class Is AWESOME. I consider the mark of a great class (especially as a gen ed) to be a class that doesn't require busy work or a great deal of time but that you are still able to learn a lot in. I did almost none of the readings beyond skimming (if that) but I still took a tremendous amount away from lecture and the research project. If you can, of course, do the readings because I'm sure they make the class even more worthwhile. Ether way if you think CB will be a painful experience it doesn't have to be! Take this class! (I'm an engineering concentrator and I'm saying a humanities class was amazing = it REALLY way)</comment>Fun</comment>This is a very interesting course that exposes you to the history of psychiatry.  However, beware the grading is not as easy as it would seem, given its gen ed status.  The class is composed of mainly pre-med underclassmen who will hurt the curve.  Also the TFs grade pretty harshly.</comment>This course was a great way for me to learn more about mental illness and how it has reached its current perception in American culture. Professor Harrington is an engaging lecturer and connects the history of psychiatry to so many different areas of history - war, feminism, gay rights, and more. However, if you are looking for a history of psychiatry in non-Western societies, you won't find that here - this course was very much focused on the United States and England. Personally, the information in the beginning was less fascinating to me than the 1960s-70s history in the United States, because the more modern history helped me learn more about how America is how it is today. That being said, it was necessary to do the earlier history to understand the foundations for more modern history.</comment>Well taught and organized. Prof. Harrington cares a lot about the material, the TF team is spectacular and the guest lecturers are top-notch. This being said, a lot of the material is pure facts with little space to argue; exams are somewhat arbitrary and the grading is a little unpredictable. If you can relax about the grade and the nontrivial workload, it's an interesting class about an important topic which we don't hear much about otherwise.</comment>It's a fantastic course. If you have even the slightest interest in the study of mental illness then you should seriously consider taking this course at some point.</comment>This is a huge, impersonal, generic course with fairly stale lectures. Prof Harrington is okay but TFs are hit or miss. You will most likely not receive detailed instruction or feedback on your work. Readings are sometimes too long or irrelevant -- don't buy the coursepack, just get it from Lamont. Not too challenging if you are looking to fill a GenEd, but not interesting enough to take as an elective.</comment>Great class.  Professor Harrington is a dynamic lecturer, and the readings and assignments are interesting.  As a senior, I can say this has been one of the best classes I have taken at Harvard.  This is a fun, interesting, and painless way to fulfill the Gen Ed.</comment>The material in this course is interesting and relevant, especially if you are interested in psychology or a pre-med field. However, don't let the fact that lectures are recorded and uploaded online tempt you into skipping class, because it's not fun catching up at the end of the semester. Be sure to stay on top of the readings and go to lectures! This course may be more difficult if you are a freshman and haven't yet taken EXPOS, because you are required to write a lengthy research paper and do a primary source analysis.</comment>It's great and really interesting.</comment>Anne Harrington is a great lecturer. The workload is fairly light, and all the lectures are videotaped. As a pre-med who saw very few appealing courses in the CB category, this was an enjoyable course from which I learned a good deal about how psychiatry came to be how it is today.</comment>The material is so interesting and the lectures are always very invigorating. The workload is not too bad, we just have readings to do every week.</comment>This is a really solid class. I only took it to fill my CB requirement, but as I realized while studying for the final, my general annoyance at having to take a class I wouldn't have otherwise obscured how much I had in fact learned (a lot). I've taken some Gen Eds where it felt like the equivalent educational value could have been derived from reading a very long article in the New Yorker etc., but this was not such a class. Anne Harrington is clearly passionate about teaching, is an engaging lecturer, and made appreciated efforts to be available to students despite the large size of the class. Sometimes the pace of lectures felt a little slow. Section was fine, but encumbered by people (like me) for whom the class was not a first priority.</comment>This class is endlessly fascinating, but is definitely not an easy gen ed.</comment>This class is great. You definitely should take it. Anne Harrington is the best.</comment>It is not for everyone, I think you should be interested in the material prior.</comment>It's a great course! Go to lecture, you will enjoy them. The books that professor Harrington has the class read are long, but fast and entertaining reads. Professor Harrington is a great person and is incredibly helpful if you need help coming up with sources, bouncing ideas off of her, etc.</comment>This class is one of the best that you will take at Harvard. Harrington is phenomenal and the material is super interesting.</comment>Amazing material, amazing teacher, can't be beat! This is the perfect Gen Ed.</comment>very interesting subject</comment>Not just an easy Gen Ed, very interesting however.</comment>Professor Harrington's lectures were great. This course is very fascinating and follows a clear path through the semester. It is a perfect course to not just fulfill the Culture ad Belief requirement but also to give you a taste of a history of science course.</comment>This is a great class! Not a lot of work and the exams and grading are very fair. Plus the material is really interesting and well-taught. Definitely worth taking if you still need to meet your Gen Ed requirement for CB.</comment>Important material and engaging lectures, you do have to put in a fair amount of work though since there are two papers and a final exam.</comment>It's immensely interesting material to learn if you are the least bit interested in medicine.</comment>You'll learn a lot through the lectures and definitely a good intro to the history of psych</comment>The course gives a comprehensive introduction into the history of psychiatry, and it will also give you the opportunity to do more research on a topic that you may be personally interested in.</comment>Madness and Medicine did not disappoint. Professor Harrington is an incredibly good lecturer and a really personable professor. The course material is really captivating and is very relatable, especially when discussing more modern-day psychiatry themes.</comment>If you have an interest in mental health care and it's really interesting history, definitely take this class. Both lectures and sections are more engaging than most and I feel I came away from this course with a lot of newly gained knowledge.</comment>This class is wonderful. It is one of those classes that actually change how you think about the world. Professor Harrington's narration skills make history very easy to swallow. One of the best courses I've taken at Harvard.</comment>This is an interesting and rewarding class. Anne Harrington and the teaching staff are very dedicated and helpful.</comment>At times it's more sociology than history of science, and it very much focuses mainly on the psychiatrist's side of history and gives little if any insight into the patient's side- It's mostly a history of psychiatry as a profession rather than a history of conceptions of madness. The grading on the exams is pretty capricious and is much more focused on rattling off names and dates than really synthesizing the material. That being said, you could do a lot worse for a GenEd.</comment>This class is great if you have a good TF. Exams are fair, the material is interesting and very well taught/told.</comment>This class is an interesting gen ed. The lectures get a little dry sometimes and you should probably have a slight interest in psychiatry.  If you like mental illnesses at all then this is the class for you.  The readings are not necessary, as they are pretty extensive and are never discussed.  All of the material you will need to know for papers and exams are based off the lectures, so basically just go to lecture and take notes. The first half of the class is a little painful but gets really interesting when the discussion of drugs come up.  Definitely read both books if you can because they were on the final and were quite enjoyable memoirs.  The workload was light and TFs were accommodating with extensions.  So if you like mental illnesses and don't mind memorizing a lot of key people and ideas, take this class.</comment>Anne is such an amazing lecturer, she is so engaging. She knows what she's talking about and it shows in her enthusiasm. The subject matter is so interesting. The work is very manageable. Definitely a class you should take.</comment>Wonderful CB requirement for science majors, especially Neuro/psych.</comment>Professor Harrington is a great professor and regardless of whether you're pre-med or not, the material is super interesting and super relevant!</comment>The exams are not bad - Anne does a fair job of making sure the exam covers big concepts and themes and doesn't throw any unexpected twists at you unfairly. However, section grading I am bit critical of because the instructions for some assignments in terms of their scope were unclear, and the TF's are grad students writing pHD papers, so they're assessing your work in a class meant to orient you towards an introduction to the history of psychiatry, at very high standards.</comment>This course is great. Prof. Harrington is a good lecturer, and she really cares about how much the students are learning from the course. It was also video-taped this year so I was able to review the lectures easily before the exam.

That being said, this course doesn't have a light workload; it was a 5-page essay and a final paper with a final exam, with non-negligible reading material. However, I think the assignments were not graded too harshly, so that was a plus. Overall I would still recommend people to take this class!</comment>Fascinating material and Harrington is a great lecturer. At times, it felt as if the expectations between Professor and the TF team were very disconnected. Hopefully this is something that will change upon feedback. Overall, a great way to fulfill the CB requirement.</comment>This course was amazing, mostly due to Harrington's lecture style. Very interesting material that makes you think about psychiatry today.</comment>I learned a lot without the added stress from other gen eds.</comment>Madness and Medicine is an amazing class! It is fun, engaging, and truly informative! I learned so much from the course's curriculum, about the history of psychiatry and how mental health movements entered into dialogues with contemporary politics, social trends, cultural movements, and economic history. In addition, though, this class truly threw into relief for me what the discipline of history of science means at Harvard, which was exciting to see. It is low-stress, really interesting, with lots of freedom to study what you want and engage with the aspects of the history that you find most interesting. One of my favorite classes!</comment>Great class, lectures are interesting as are readings, assignments aren't unmanageable, and Professor Harrington is awesome.</comment>Professor Harrington is an incredible lecturer! The course material is very interesting, and I think students of all concentrations would find it interesting as well. That being said, it is a gen ed, so if your forte is not in writing, this course will not be super easy. Fortunately, I enjoyed the material quite a bit so I was willing to deal with essays and etc.; also, even as someone who does not like writing, the writing assignments were definitely manageable!</comment>Do the reading, its not super important for tests, but its very interesting and I really wish i had done more of it, just because it was very well designed to improve the course and open your mind-- im serious.</comment>Certainly one of the more interesting Gen-Eds, it is a truly engaging and unique course, with an instructor who genuinely cares about the students.</comment>This class was not overwhelming work wise, but very interesting and engaging.</comment>Very interesting course with intriguing material that's very likely to be quite different from anything you've ever learned before. Lectures are good and interesting, although there is a bit of reading, that you could probably weed out and pick and choose the more pertinent ones. Keep in mind that theres both a final and a final paper, but overall great class, especially if you are interested in the history of science!</comment>This was a great course with a reasonable amount of work.</comment>This class really allowed me to deepen my appreciation for psychology and mental health. Go to office hours with Professor Harrington! She is awesome and very enthusiastic!</comment>This course's topics are very interesting, but unless you're very interested in history of science and the humanities, this class is too much work (especially for a gen ed). The expectations are difficult to grasp, because they expect a certain type of writing. The readings are sometimes so arbitrary...and those who put in the hours to read don't necessary do better on the exams, which barely require any reading. Overall kind of a frustrating class.</comment>The amount of reading may seem daunting, but don't decide to not do any of it and skip lecture like many of us did. Try to make it to lecture as often as possible, Anne Harrington is so engaging and it will save you so much time in the future. Don't do all the readings, its impossible, so stick to the primary sources or any others that she mentions explicitly.</comment>Really great way to fulfill Culture and Belief, especially if you're someone with an interest in medicine/how science and culture interact.  Professor Harrington is an excellent lecturer and really engages the class in the material.  Everything is well-structure and well-organized, and the material is easy to learn.</comment>Great course, not too much reading material, interesting lectures.</comment>Solid class. Taught me new things about psychiatry that completely changed my view of psychiatry today.</comment>Take this course if you're at all curious about psychiatry's history (because it really is going to teach you the comprehensive timeline underlying the psychiatric discipline). However, be aware that there are a good number of assessments throughout the semester, so it can be a time-consuming class at certain points throughout the term.</comment>Definitely a fun class to take as a Gen Ed. Not really necessary to do all the readings as long as you attend lecture, which Professor Harrington does a great job of making entertaining. The first third of the course is kind of slow but when it picks up it gets very interesting.</comment>I HIGHLY recommend this class. The things I learned in Madness and Medicine often make me think deeply about the news or happenings in my daily life, and I often find myself questioning truths I am used to taking for granted in a thoughtful way because of this class. 10/10. Take any class with Anne Harrington that you can. She is a demigod professor but also truly engaging and really accessible (she encourages class participation despite the big lecture format and loves when students come to office hours).</comment>If you want a relatively straight forward gen ed, take this class. It's basically kind of like a history class except you'll constantly be asked to think in terms of themes. Also, there is both a final paper and a exam so know if your schedule can handle that.</comment>This is not only the best gen ed, but also one of the best courses I took at Harvard.</comment>This is a good Culture and Belief Gen Ed if you are interested in medicine. The lectures are very interesting and the weekly readings are not too overwhelming. There are two short essays and a midterm so it is only a lot of work right before those assignments are due. However, there are two assignments during reading period, a research paper and a final exam, so be prepared for that work.</comment>Do your readings and attend lecture, very interesting class and manageable if you do the work</comment>This course was hands down the most interesting course I have taken at Harvard. Learning about the history of psychiatry truly changed the way I view the field today, and my approach towards mental health and mental illness has changed drastically! TAKE THIS COURSE! You will not regret it!</comment>It's a really neat, really interesting class all about the history of psychiatry. If you don't really love history, but recognize you need to take a history course, this course lets you study the progression and evolution of beliefs in the field of psychiatry -- basically changing ideas in science! It's taught by the History of Science Department. So it's science (and history).</comment>This is a great course! Fascinating material, great lectures and readings. You'll definitely leave the course with a deep understanding of the history of psychiatry in the US.</comment>If you take this class for any reason, it should be for Professor Harrington's lectures alone. She is a wonderful speaker and I encourage to attend absolutely all of her lectures.</comment>Take advantage of the reading resources they're extremely interesting and not too difficult</comment>If you haven't taken other classes on the history of social science, be wary  of taking this class. Although it started out very interesting, it soon went into  substantial technical details. i just wish I knew this before taking the class, it would have saved me from wasting my CB requirement.</comment>I absolutely loved this class and would recommend anyone to take it! It was a great course and had very engaging material. It does require a final paper and a final exam so just be aware when picking other classes that might have a demanding final exam period.</comment></course>ENGLISH 44: Arrivals: The Invention of English Literature, 700-1700</title>Professor Wang gives very compelling lectures. Some texts are very good, some texts--The Canterbury Tales, in particular--are overpraised and perhaps dwelled on a little too much. Still the department is in love with that text so it's not really Professor Wang's fault. Anyway, a solid course where you will learn a lot and read some fascinating texts. An interest in religion, and questions of faith, helps make some of the more drier sections easier to swallow, but is not necessary.</comment>While you do walk away from the class with very ingrained knowledge about Arrivals-era literature and the skill to read Middle English aloud, the course is very structured and isn't very dynamic in terms of talking points or the way discussions happen.</comment>Professor Wang really loves the material, and gives you an appreciation of texts that can be a bit of a bear to get through.</comment>This is a strong Arrivals course, though understand that you might not have the deepest conversations on the material. Do the readings--they're absolutely worth it--but understand that, if you find a particular passage or detail surprising, you will probably have to bring it up, otherwise it might get glossed over.</comment>Great way to fulfill the Arrivals requirement! I'm not a medievalist and wasn't looking forward to this requirement, but I enjoyed the class; Professor Wang is really knowledgeable, approachable, and engaging, and readings and papers are super manageable.</comment>This is an excellent way to fulfill the Arrivals component of the Common Ground courses. Dr. Wang is energetic, knowledgeable, down-to-earth and witty.</comment>Lectures are not the best, but sections are good and the assignments are of college-level rigor, unlike those in the comparable Donohue class. Definitely take this one- both Yun and Prof. Wang are enthusiastic, helpful, and insanely knowledgable.</comment>If you are an english major needing to take an Arrivals class this is a great one. That being said it is still going to be early english literature which is obviously not something everyone enjoys.</comment>Professor Wang and Yun are incredible! While the course load may sound intimidating, they make the material so much fun and exciting. This is the best way to satisfy your Arrivals requirement!</comment>This is a pretty straightforward course that's very well organized, almost to a fault at times. The assignments (minus the quizzes) are solid. As far as Common Grounds go, this one demands an adequate amount out of you so worth checking out. Also, reading Middle English out loud is pretty cool! Even though I sometimes didn't know what I was saying.</comment>Professor Wang and Yun are very cool people. Both are tremendously passionate about their topics, and you could do worse than take a course from them. However, they are still  inexperienced as pedagogues, and sometimes the class felt stiff and overly lightweight. The papers are graded to a surprisingly more serious standard than the class discussion is held to. Sometimes the things we learned in the class discussions felt somewhat rote and not geared towards deep understandings -- as, perhaps, is inevitable with a survey course of this magnitude.</comment>This is a great way to take Arrivals. Laura is really passionate about the material and lectures beautifully. Be prepared to really engage with the texts and take time to understand them</comment></course>SOCIOL 135: Education and Culture</title>This class is a really great class, with a lot of good readings that you will need for this course, and for others if you're very passionate about education. A must-take course.</comment>it's easy and really interesting but lectures are incredibly boring and unfortunately required</comment>ABSOLUTELY take this class! It was such a treat and something to look forward to every week. There is a bit of reading/writing, but it is all graded really fairly and is not meant to trip you up. One of the best classes I have taken at Harvard.</comment>This course was excellent and about such an important subject matter. I learned so much about education and the disparities in the educational system which is important to understand coming from all types of education and ending at Harvard. The sections were amazing and the TF made the course so amazing. Everyone should take this course.</comment>This class has very interesting material (especially if you have never taken a sociology course). It has a low workload and no exams. That being said, a decent amount of effort is required, as lecture attendance is mandatory (this is rare). If you go to lecture and you do the low amount of work, you will reap the rewards in your grade.</comment>Readings were interesting, but lectures and discussions didn't feel very rigorous which took away a lot from the experience.</comment>This class has a very low workload and is pretty easy. However, if you're someone with a really strong interest in the education system and pretty knowledgable about the in</comment>This course has some really interesting and thought-provoking content and pushes you to apply the information to your life and possible solutions for education crises. This takes a more theory-based approach to solving problems in education rather than concrete policies. Lecture can be pretty boring but assignments and grading are generally very easy.</comment>You might have to push yourself to think about yourself in your communities and it might make you uncomfortable! Be willing to go there, and then some (especially if you come from a White, middle or upper class background).</comment>Great topic if you are interested in education, but horribly taught. The professor does not bring as much enthusiasm into the course as I would have liked, and the due dates for assignments were always poorly timed (paper due the Monday after Thanksgiving and then the final paper due a few days after)</comment>There is a lot of focus on methodology in this course. The lecture style may not be suitable for everyone.</comment>Do not take this class if you are the kind of person who is tired of talking about race and class issues, and especially don't take this class if you think we live in a postracial America. You will not enjoy the class and will probably further confirm your erroneous views by turning everything you read around. :)</comment></course>COMPSCI 141: Computing Hardware</title>This class, although a bit disorganized, will give you a new found appreciation for your computer.</comment>The course material is interesting but the labs are very time consuming- the last few weeks of the semester I spent ~15 hours a week on just the labs. This is time outside of the time I spent in class and doing homework assignments. Just be aware that throughout the course the lab is a significant amount of outside work- I don't think that is always made clear by the teaching staff.</comment>This is an extremely interesting class, but is definitely time consuming. But you really learn a lot when you spend a significant amount of time debugging code. If you really want to learn about computer architecture, this is definitely a good introduction. I think all CS concentrators should take this course and EE concentrators as well, especially if you're in EE and are interested in the CS side. The lab component is the most time-consuming portion. The problem sets are pretty straightforward and don't require too much time. If the labs were as disorganized as they were this semester, you will constantly be frustrated by the ambiguity of the specifications given to you and spend many hours debugging things that really weren't in your control. But if you have a great partner, the experience is made a little bit better. You definitely bond with your classmates in this course a lot, and as an EE concentrator, I really enjoyed working with CS concentrators.</comment>This class was a brutal grind. Although I learned a lot throughout the course, specifically about computer architecture, FPGA's and verilog, I don't know if it was worth the struggle. The lectures were pretty dull, there are p-sets every week (which typically don't take too long) but the labs are really difficult and lengthy, taking 6-12 hours, sometimes more, each week trying to get your code working. The software we used was really outdated, and the course structure/teaching fellows did not make it easy to get help with the buggy Xilinx program. Avi was extremely helpful throughout the course, but was also very often busy teaching ES52, and certain problems no TFs could help with and they would just refer you to Avi. Overall, a very tough class that took a ton of effort, and while learning a lot, it just seemed like changes should be made to make it more effective and up-to-date.</comment>I would not take this class without significant changes from this year. The material was interesting and the psets were fair but the labs took 30-40 hours a week. There is not enough teaching staff, not enough office hours, and not enough lab staff who actually know Verilog and the lab assignments. The take home exams are long and don't test the material from class</comment>High workload class with both problem sets and labs.  Lectures go over material for the pset / take-home midterm / take-home final, but you can also learn effectively from the textbook.  Lab sections and TFs go over material for the lab.

Labs took me ~7 hours/wk, psets took me ~3 hours/wk.</comment>This class has a lot of great potential. Brooks knows what he's talking about, but the labs need significant improvement.  At the moment, we would spend hours trying to debug code and errors that TFs themselves told us, since they had no idea as to what exactly the code was doing. Yes, I understand that these are all grad school students, but they need to take the time out to prepare for the weekly lab session that they lead.  Don't take the hours as a joke as well.  The psets are really straightforward, but the labs are a pain.</comment>Prof. Brooks teaches well.

If you don't like struggling with implementations, you probably shouldn't take this course.</comment>Be prepared to allocate a lot of time for this course.  I wasn't given any heads up, and I chose other classes that were also time intensive.  That made this class more difficult.</comment>Expect to spend a lot of time on this class.  You are assigned homework and coding assignments (labs) which usually add up to at least 10 to 15 hours per week.</comment>Very interesting material.  Professor Brooks is a good lecturer. Recommend because of just how cool computing hardware can be. The TFs have not invested themselves heavily in the course. The labs are often frustrating. Pretty much all things you will see in every response.</comment>Start the labs as soon as possible because they will take forever to get working properly.</comment>Very interesting material, but the class was not well run. Exam and midterm were filled with typos. Verilog lesson was after the lab, not before, etc</comment>I have mixed feelings about this course. In my opinion, the labs, while difficult, were the best part of the course, and you really gain an understanding of how a CPU is implemented, because you implement one yourself as the last lab! The labs do take a ton of time, and the 3 hours per week that they allocate for you are really just help sessions where you can ask questions of the TFs and get help. Lectures were pretty dry most of the time, although at times they could be informative and interesting. Problem sets were generally pretty easy (except for pipelining) but very tedious, consisting of hand-translating code into assembly or machine code or drawing large gate diagrams. Exams were similar to the problem sets (we had a midterm and a final, both of the take-home variety). Overall, I thought the amount of stuff I learned in this class and the cool labs outweighed the dryness of the lecture and the tediousness of the problem sets. Full disclosure: I am a CS concentrator with a few more CS classes under my belt than some of the other people in this class who were more EE-focused, so I found the labs easier and the problem sets trickier than they did.</comment>I would not recommend this class at all. Professor Brooks does not care about the class or students. His lecture slides are years old and will likely not be updated anytime soon. He is not involved with assignments or labs. Most of the teaching staff are either incompetent or just do not care/put in enough time to make the labs run smoothly. They do not know exactly what's going on in labs. The due dates and organization of assignments/labs was completely arbitrary, and students in earlier labs did not get the same amount of time to work on them because the labs were released at the same time to all students, while being due at the end of the assigned lab section. It basically felt like taking an exam every week.</comment>Ensure you have necessary time in your schedule to devote to this course.</comment>The course is awesome and is an absolute staple for EE and CS. You learn how to use Hardware Description Language (Verilog) to design hardware. By the end of the course you will have designed a humbler version of a real computer processor. The problem sets are trivial but the labs take much more than the scheduled 3 hours - think of the labs as the real problem sets and the problem sets as a warm-up. You can easily do the labs alone if you put in the required time and you will learn much more that way as well. If you're familiar with Physics 123, it's essentially the digital portion of Physics 123 continued into the 21's century - there isn't much overlap after the first two weeks. Awesome class - more EE classes should be like this.</comment>The lab are demanding. Make sure to get a good partner, and read the book--the lecture and textbook provide the same amount of information in terms of what is used in labs and assignments.</comment>This class is a lot of work. There are 4 labs, 9 problem sets, 1 midterm, and 1 final. Sounds like your average class? Think again. The 4 labs are split into parts, and it's basically like having double homework every week. If you're okay with the work, it's a great class. Prof Brooks is a wonderful lecturer and teaches you A LOT in a semester. Whether you're an engineer or computer scientist, it's great to know a bit about circuits and computer architecture. Beware, though, the TFs are usually not prepared (save for Sam, the head TF) and will be little of help on all the assignments. The problem sets and labs will also have errors, omissions, and missing details. In general, the course staff could be better prepared. But I believe the knowledge you learn makes it (kind of) worth it.</comment>This class has the potential to be good but it needs a lot of work. In particular the labs need to be re done and it would be good if the teaching staff had better understanding of the material.Overall I would be very careful before enrolling in this course.</comment>It is great to learn how computers work at a low level. It is empowering to build your own assembler or multi-cycle processor. It is good to build these things for yourself, and learn how to use a FPGA.
However, the virtualbox, which you have to complete the labs in, was unwieldy and annoying. The labs were unrealistically ambitious. It was nearly impossible to complete some of them without significant help from TFs, who were generally unavailable outside of lab time. It was unrealistic to think you could come into lab with questions for the TF and finish it within 3 hours.</comment>The professor obviously doesn't care at all- he is a terrible lecturer and has not even looked at the lab materials. He doesn't have office hours and won't answer any student questions. The material is cool, but don't bother with the class. Take 161 and learn about hardware that way or just read a book...</comment></course>ENGLISH 294z: On Beauty: Graduate Seminar</title>I think that English grad students shouldn't miss the opportunity to take this class and engage with its content.</comment>This course is a Harvard English classic - I think an understanding of the history of aesthetic discourse, the gifts and curses of beauty, is necessary to an understanding of literature itself.</comment>This course is an exceptional opportunity to consider a subject that is all too often passed over or unthinkingly treated in other seminars. It has a wider array of readings than just about any other seminar in the department, and it will ask you to think in ways no other English seminar ever would.</comment></course>ECON 2060: Contract Theory</title>This course is a very good introduction to contract theory. A lot of material was covered. However, there is not enough home assignments (only two HA during the semester), in my opinion. So, if you need additional stimulus in the form of HA and other graded activities for reading papers and studying during the semester, then do not wait for them. If you are quite organized and self-motivated and you are interested in the subject, then you can take the course. There is also no sections, which is not very good, as the models are sometimes quite hard. The course is also not very good organized.</comment>Interesting material, very motivated instructor, but unstructured.</comment>In my opinion, the topic itself is one of the most interesting fields in economics. Lectures are quite entertaining. However, course isn't very well organized. Required workload is low - you should be motivated to work by yourself to get a lot from the course.</comment>Good class for an intro to contract theory, it is geared to set the stage for research so at times it goes into a little more depth than one would want if one just wanted to get a very high level overview.</comment></course>STAT 244: Linear and Generalized Linear Models</title>Best course ever. Super clear. Useful material. I will definitely keep the course materials for future reference.</comment>Absolutely fantastic class! Professor Agresti is a wonderful lecturer and so approachable.</comment>I had already heard of almost every topic that this course went over, but it went over each topic in much more depth than I had done previously, which was fantastic.</comment>Unfortunately this is the last year taught by Prof. Agresti. It is also the last full course he lectures in his career as a professor. So comments probably will not be applicable to future students. GLM is a very useful area if anyone is interested in data science.</comment>This is one of the best-taught classes I have ever taken. Alan's lectures and his book were wonderful and thorough and gave a clear introduction to the theory and application of GLM's.</comment>This is BY FAR the best course I have taken at Harvard. It is nothing short of phenomenal how Alan can keep the material so superbly organized while pushing forward at such a pace. I've learned so much from this one class, and I'm quite certain no other class will even come close to matching how good this one was. Without Alan, however, I'm not sure how the course will be.</comment>This class is super well thought out. It was pretty rigorous theoretically, and also had lots of applied examples in R. The book was a great resource and provided plenty of parallel examples to work with. The TA also did a lot of really helpful simulations to make us believe that theory works. And all of the homeworks felt like they were pointedly trying to help us learn.</comment>Note that after 2014, Dr. Agresti won't be teaching this class, and it will probably be different in the future.

As an undergrad in the course, I say that it makes sense to take as a second or third course in linear modeling (i.e., after 139 and/or 149) or as a first course pass-fail. The material moves quite fast, and it's tough to keep up if you don't already have some background in regression. On the plus side, you will cover almost everything you would in an entire year of the undergrad sequence, plus theory, plus more (including quasi-likelihood and modeling correlated responses). Exams are difficult, but fair. Problem sets take work, but the course offers good support through office hours and the textbook. You'll learn a *lot*, but chances are a fair amount will go over your head too.</comment>One of the best classes I have taken while at Harvard. I actually feel sorry for those who won't be able to take it under Alan as it will be his last offering of Stat 244.</comment>Alan is a WONDERFUL TEACHER! I have 95% confidence that his teaching is better than 90% of the professors in the stat department at Harvard.</comment>This was one of the best courses I've ever taken. I believe this is the last year that Prof. Agresti will be teaching it, but if the format is the same in future years I would strongly recommend it to anyone with a serious interest in statistics.</comment>Section is great, but not like a normal course's section- you go over new material NOT covered in the lectures, rather than cementing the material covered. Course covers crazy amount of material.</comment>Interesting material and Alan is an amazing lecturer</comment>Alan is a great lecturer, and his book is fantastic. The course is very well organized, and not overly difficult. The benefit-to-effort payoff is great. For a theory course, things are pretty well-grounded and tied to applications, in part by the nature of the topic.</comment>The class was amazing. Professor Agresti (although it's probably his last year teaching this) was awesome, and he explained the concepts in a very clear, illuminating, and inspiring way. Definitely my highlight of the semester!</comment></course>RUSS 101: Advanced Russian I</title>This is a great class. Excellent teachers and excellent people on a personal level.</comment>You'll probably learn more during conversation section than grammar section, because you'll go over a lot of the verbs and grammar rules that you've already encountered.</comment>The third Natalia in the Russian sequence is just as much a treat as the others.</comment>Natalia Iosifovna is great! She's very helpful with the material, even if the material is very simple. If you did well in Russian B, you'll do fine in this class.</comment></course>CHEM 160: The Quantum World</title>Avoid at all costs. Change concentrations if you must. Drop out of Harvard and run an ice cream stand - you'll learn more doing that anyways. In the unfortunate event that you do take this class as is, make friends with both your classmates and the TFs - without them, you stand no chance of completing any of the assignments, regardless of how intelligent you are.  The course ideally would be split into one or two semesters of mathematical quantum chemistry and a semester of computational chemistry; alas, this is not the case. Instead, lecture and homework have approximately zero overlap. Lectures are mindbendingly difficult to follow. I believe maybe a handful of people in a class of several dozen were able to keep up with things. The problem sets and "considerable exercise" midterms demand that you have some background in programming, CS50 at a minimum.  The organization is atrocious. Office hours were irregular and announced only hours in advance. Distribution code rarely worked.  I could go on for hours, but the upshot is this: Chem 160, as is, is nothing but a waste of your precious time, money, and energy. If you wish to learn, look elsewhere.</comment>Have a solid background in programming, it'll make the class much more manageable. Go to office hours!</comment>I understand that the teaching staff was trying very hard to make this a good course. But I honestly cannot give this class a good review, and it was a complete waste of my time. To be fair, this was the first iteration of a very new course structure, but it was nowhere close to working. If you are considering taking this course, please use the add/drop deadline to your advantage and see if the course has improved since I took it.  First, I want to talk about the lectures. Alan is a great and friendly guy, and very intelligent, but the lectures did not teach me anything. We were all given lecture notes to fill out with equations and follow along in class, but this was all we did: go through the lecture notes, page by page, and fill in the blanks with equations with no clue as to where these equations came from.   The assignments are set up so that attendance at the lectures isn't even necessary to receive good grades. These problem sets were so easy that it was probably 10% the difficulty of any CS50 programming assignment. Furthermore, they required absolutely no knowledge of what was going on in class to complete. For instance, some problem sets would literally consist of blocks of code to fill out, and the instructions would tell you line by line what to do ("write a for loop and print this", "graph this"). I easily completed each problem set with no clue what was happening.  Sometimes, it was even worse: problem sets were distributed with numerous bugs, and often the code that was provided by the staff just plain crashed or didn't work. When this happened, fixes would be emailed to the class, sometimes very late in the week, right before the pset was due. I often got frustrated because my code wouldn't run simply because the boilerplate code didn't work. Assignments did not contribute to my learning at all.   Here's a tip regarding how to choose classes: look carefully at the assignments. Make sure they are challenging enough that you can learn the more difficult concepts in class well by completing the psets. Make sure that they actually help you learn and don't consist of rote coding of for loops with no purpose in mind. This class was a disaster, partially because the assignments contributed absolutely nothing.   If you are interested in quantum and you have room in your schedule for a challenging but fulfilling course, skip this class and take Physics 143a.</comment>This is a great class for chemistry concentrators. They really focus on teaching you what you need to know about quantum as a chemist. Don't expect to really go in depth into the math and theory, there are other courses for that. Alan and his staff have crafted an amazing course for chemistry concentrators.</comment>You will not learn quantum mechanics after taking this course. You will in fact learn very little of the principles. Nonetheless, you will learn python and get an intuition for how to take on quantum problems. You will get a lay of the land--the bigger picture of quantum at the expensive of not comprehending the details.</comment>This is a great class!! From what I've heard, chem 160 in previous years has been painless and hard to understand -- this is definitely not the case anymore! Alan and the rest of the teaching staff are wonderful. They are so clearly excited about the material and the students, which makes everything so much more enjoyable. The material is interesting and the class has a strong focus on how things are applied (especially with the coding psets) which is super cool and important! Work load is very low, and there are no exams. They really give you the freedom to decide what kinds of things you find interesting and to pursue those. That being said, it's easy to get by without really understanding the material, so make sure that doesn't happen to you!</comment>-there exists a gap between the skills that is required to do problem sets and that required to understand the lecture. this means that you can do psets and quizzes without fully understanding the lecture, but doing so will fundamentally hurt you. i recommend that you try your best to grasp the materials taught in class.</comment>How much you get out of the class is entirely dependent on how much work you put into the class. You can totally get through without knowing any actual course content, as long as you can finish the iPython exercises. Or you can spend hours laboring over the content, but have no difficult assessment or problem set to test your knowledge. It is extremely interesting material, and Alan and the TFs are super enthusiastic about helping you every step along the way. But you really have to have the self-motivation to learn the material, if you want to get anything out of the course.</comment>You are exposed to methods used by contemporary quantum scientists, which is cool, but as always you get out what you put in.</comment>Start on the considerable exercises early because office hours are necessary to do well on them.</comment>If Alan is teaching this, you should take it. I took this class having no idea what it was going to be like. I think it was one of the best decisions ever. It's essentially a coding class (Python), so if you have a lot of background with coding, you'll be fine. Otherwise, be wary. I'm not sure how much quantum I actually learned, 1)because it's hard but also 2) because of the structure of the course. No exams, just longer psets called "considerable exercises." Weekly online quizzes that have a ridiculous amount of extra credit. Only frustrating part is a lot of typos in the psets. Otherwise, a fantastic course--one where you can dabble in quantum while getting a good grade.</comment>I took CHEM 160 instead of PS1/PS11 as a pre-med requirement and I'm extremely grateful for the decision. The class uses the edX platform which is really helpful for keeping track of all of the course materials including 5-10 minute instructional "pencasts." It presents a lot of material but you aren't required to learn all of it. You will get out however much you put in, however. A lot of the earlier programming exercises can be completed without learning any quantum chemistry. The staff is very approachable, and there is a lot of hand-holding through the exercises. Not having tests from this class really alleviates stress. The programming aspect is a huge plus and demystifies quantum chemistry when you can see every step take place in code.</comment>The class was not too challenging and you gain an appreciation for how theoretical chemists and experimentalists could collaborate and work together. I would recommend you have some coding experience, but besides that there isn't a strong requirement for math/physics background. (In the future they probably should buff up on the Math/Physics to make the class more relevant but that day is not today). Also, make sure you're able to go to office hours to go over your code at least once a week.</comment>Overall, the class was a lot of fun - at the beginning, the iPython component felt a bit like being thrown into the deep end, but I ended up feeling like I learned a lot of useful programming skills, and the programming exercises were a lot of fun. (Though, honestly, you could probably get through most of the programming assignments without completely understanding the course material.) The class sometimes felt a bit disorganized and/or overwhelming, though probably some of this could be chalked up to the fact that it was basically a new course this year, and overall the class was not a HUGE amount of work. Also, the teaching staff and Alan were fabulous - very helpful and accessible.</comment>Alan and the teaching staff are fantastic people and you can tell they really care about you learning. It was a super chill course that allowed you to take what you wanted from it (e.g. you could either just coast through and be a code monkey or actually take the time to properly learn the concepts). With weekly psets and only two "considerable exercises" with no final, it's definitely not too time-intensive but I felt like it was more a class on coding (in python) than actually learning the theory of quantum chemistry. That was largely on me though because the materials are there to help you learn beyond just the code. Overall really solid course and after hearing from friends who took past versions of chem 160, it was definitely the most fun and least painful.</comment>This is a required concentration course, even if you do not have a lot of interest in quantum chemistry. Fortunately, the coding assignments were all very easy and comparable to the in-class examples.</comment>Very laid back class- onus is on the student to be self motivated if you want to learn anything, because most of what you learn you don't need to know in order to get a good grade.  If you're motivated, you will learn tons.</comment>As taught by Alan this course was fantastic and not like any other science course I have ever taken. The class was very low stress and doesn't require a huge amount of time dedicated to it in order to get through with decent grades - however if you don't dedicate the time, you won't take away much because many of the assignments are able to be done without a real understanding of quantum mechanics. For the considerable exercises definitely start them before a week before they're due!! I didn't and it was a bit painful to cram them into a short period of time. The teaching staff for the course is extremely dedicated and nice - they seriously made the course as great as it was. Watching Alan lecture is always a fun experience, whether or not you actually know what he's talking about! He's just so passionate you can't help but feel that what he's talking about is cool. I'm not sure how this will be taught in the future, but I really enjoyed it (but would have enjoyed it more if I had actually dedicated the time to really knowing the material). I did definitely learn some things too even though I definitely didn't learn all the material!</comment>I would definitely recommend this class but if you are a chem concentrator-- you have to take it anyways. The psets are all coding so if you are okay with that- than the class is not bad. The two midterms are also coding exercises and they give you a lot of time and guidance.</comment>They changed the class entirely and it was awesome. If you like practical applications of quantum mechanics this is your course. You get to write code to implement all the stuff you learn and see how it really works.</comment>Chem 160 teaches you how to code in ipython -- an incredibly valuable life skill -- and the teaching staff are so dedicated and excited about the course that it makes the whole experience fun and rewarding.</comment>This is a fun way to learn about quantum chemistry. You will also improve your skills at programming in ipython.  However, this will not give the rigorous, proof-based, pen-and-paper quantum mechanics education.</comment>Programming skills are beneficial.</comment>I actually really ended up liking this course. My coding skills have gotten significantly better, along with my conceptual understanding of quantum mechanics. That being said, I did put in a lot of work outside of lecture by going to office hours every week. They were also fun to go to since the teaching staff and very friendly and helpful. Really, if you put in the work, you will get a good grade.</comment>If you want to learn quantum you definitely can in this course. If you got stuck taking this because its a requirement and you really don't care about quantum, you'll still be fine. I got an A in this course and have no idea what I learned in any of the lectures. Don't think I could explain a single thing about quantum chemistry.But thats ok because you don't need to know it. A lot of the course is coding based so if you had no background (like me) go early in the course for help to learn the basics and you'll be fine. Takes some time, but nowhere near as difficult or time consuming as other courses I've taken at Harvard. Go to office hours as much as you can to get the coding psets done and start considerable exercises early. Really though, don't be afraid of this class.The TFs are great so use them!!!</comment>Good, painless class. Not a great way to really learn quantum chemistry (if you want to understand the theory) but good for learning computational quantum chem.</comment>This class teaches you all the basics and fundamentals of a very useful language, Python. The computational skills you take away from this class will be valuable many science fields.</comment></course>APMTH 115: Mathematical Modeling</title>really interesting material but kind of disorganized</comment>Great class. Not a significant workload for a concentration class, but learned how to approach modeling with MATLAB. Make sure you don't put off the final individual project for too long.</comment>this is the most useless class at harvard.</comment>It's not a lot of work weekly, but as you're going do pay attention to a few topics that interest you, and give them a little more attention and maybe earmark them if they're something you might wanna work on for a group project.</comment>Please take it!! And preferrably as a junior or a sophomore! It really helps you nail down the routine and basic good habits to develop for to be excellent in mathematical modelling. The things to pay attention to, how to use different coding packages and techniques with data to asnwer a problem, how to work with other people and receive critical feedback! I loved it! If you are a big fan of meaningful teamwork, this is your class!</comment>Professor Kuang and this course overall is excellent. You are exposed to a lot of different ways of thinking about problems and you will get out exactly what you put in regarding the material as a whole.</comment>Great if you want to learn MATLAB and do your own stuff - could be better-organized and have more clear objectives.</comment>The projects can be fun and allow applied math people to use the things learned in previous classes to build models.</comment>Make sure to have some background in applied math when taking.</comment>Interesting, light workload. Very broad.</comment>I am a senior who has been taking applied math courses all throughout Harvard. I wish I had taken this class sooner. It helps you view every math context in a modeling perspective. All my past applied math classes seemed to matter and make much more sense (in terms of practicality) while taking this class. Taking modeling early will open your perspective for all your future math, stat, econ, CS, bio, chem, physics courses. Don't make the mistake I made, and try to take it early, sophomore and juniors.</comment>I took this course with Prof. Kuang, and it was great! The lectures were interesting, but the material is never tested -- no problem sets or exams. Instead the grade is based on two group projects and one individual project, were you have free reign to model whatever you like.</comment>This course is a really great hands on introduction to basic mathematical modeling using MATLAB. The workshops and group projects were a great way to actually apply the material that we learned in class, so you will leave this class with a sense that you actual gained some tangible skills, which is really nice. Don't expect to learn any hardcore modeling/mathematics though, most of the topics covered are done so quickly and at a really surface level.</comment>The material in the class could have been interesting, but I don't feel like I learned much. Lectures were not particularly engaging, and the professor spent time just providing the model, but not explaining how that model was arrived at, and why the parameters were chosen, or how to think about approaching a model. I was definitely looking for more of the latter when I chose to take this class. 

The in-class exercises are good, but challenging unless you have some conception of MATLAB. It's easy not to pay attention in the class, but to get the most value out of it, it's necessary to pay attention and perform the exercises.

The workload is very light for the most part—no homework assignments or mandatory sections. During group project times, though, the workload spiked immensely and many a late night were dedicated to these projects. They were also the funnest part of the class, as it was actually creating a model from scratch for a topic of choice.</comment>Great course, please be prepared to pay attention in lecture and bounce ideas off the TF and professor!</comment>Some lectures were cool, the teachers were great, class overall is worth taking.  Projects were graded pretty hard but by the end it ended up being very helpful.</comment>You must be good at Matlab, not just kind of know it.</comment>This is an amazing class! While I can say the same about a lot of classes at Harvard. This is a class where you can apply the knowledge 5 years down the line. Very applicable and interesting! Definitely take this class if you have the capacity!!</comment>qa</comment>Professor Kuang is a very nice guy and wants this class to be good. Unfortunately right now it is a bit unorganized and expectations aren't always clear for the assignments. The workload is very light when projects aren't due (they are all you are graded on during the semester). I would suggest starting all the projects early.</comment></course>ECON 985n: Research in Applied Microeconomics, Labor and Gender</title>Jane is great and I would definitely recommend this thesis seminar!</comment>If you are writing a thesis, you have to take this class. I overall enjoyed it. Jane is a great tutorial leader and I know the other instructors are awesome! The feedback was helpful and the assignments helped you stay on track. The stata psets were annoying because they took hours. I would work on that more than my thesis on a given week.</comment></course>BCMP 308qc: Cell Fate Decisions in Development and Disease</title>The readings are excellent by themselves, but it´s the discussion component that matters most.</comment></course>HAA 191x: Books and Things in the Colonial World</title>I loved Professor Cummins. He is a great man and a very knowledgable resource. You can tell that he loves what he is talking about and it is infectious. This class was so interesting and really delves into the Encounter between the native peoples and the Spaniards on a level that is often ignored.</comment>Fascinating material that Prof. Cummins deals with in a very sophisticated and thought-provoking way. And do the readings! They're really good and they help tie together all the big ideas he lectures about.</comment></course>US-WORLD 31: American Society and Public Policy</title>I liked this class overall, because it was my first exposure to these topics. For other gov/sociology experienced students, this class could be a bit repetitive. Also, make sure you want to do a bit of reading and writing, because some weeks the reading is pretty intense. Lastly, especially for Professor Skocpol's lectures in particular, it can sometimes be a bit one-sided, so if you lean right politically, this could be a tough class to express your opinion (though in section, TF's were really supportive).</comment>It is a really interesting gen-ed but definitely not a gimme course. You definitely have to put in the work to do the readings.</comment>This class was challenging for a gen ed, but I think that was in large part because of the teaching fellows. The class content and lectures are really interesting and relevant to current events. The class helped me to better understand politics, policy and current trends in the US. There was a lot of reading at times, but it was doable.</comment>This was an overall solid course. It had a steady but not overwhelming workload and gave interesting insight of how our policies are affecting different groups differently and to look at the direction the United States is heading in.</comment>Overall a very good class. It is very informative about some of the major dilemmas facing our nation. Some weeks there is quite a bit of reading but overall it is not too bad and you can get by with just skimming some of it if you pay attention in lecture.</comment>The class was really interesting and provided a great overview to inequality in America. In fact, the class should be called "Inequality in America" as all of the policies we looked at focused on their current role in exacerbating inequality in America since the 1970s</comment>This class provides a great overview of issues that are currently at the center of much political and social debate.  I now have a much better historical and factual understanding of the evolution of issues such as immigration and healthcare.  The workload is fairly light and very interesting/relevant to issues that are important to understand to be an informed american citizen.</comment>It's a good course, Waters and Skocpol are great and know their stuff. It might be frustrating and slow at times for people who know the subject matter really well and be prepared for Harvard students at their worst in your sections.</comment>This course was one of the best I have taken at Harvard in that it taught me so much about the America that we are living in today and the issues that we are facing in politics.  It not only teaches you about the issues, but you discuss potential solutions to these complicated problems.  I think this makes you a better member of the US democracy when you can make education choices in elections and in discussions with other people.</comment>you don't need any background in government to do well in this class, although it certainly helps if you have studied american policy to some extent. this class is a bit more quantitatively-oriented than some gov classes (a ton of the lecture slides are just charts and graphs), but you also don't need statistics to do well.</comment>This class is a good introduction to the mechanisms of public policy and the major issues today. The assignments were fun and section discussions were interesting. However, the coverage of these issues is heavily biased. Don't expect both sides of an issue to be covered, especially in lecture. It's still an interesting class; just don't forget to always question what Professors Skocpol and Waters are presenting.</comment>really interesting class, a little more work than a standard gen ed, but you learn a lot if you put the time in to doing most of the readings and showing up to lecture</comment>This class is a very low time commitment, but does not do a good job at explaining the creation and implementation of policy from anything but a extreme liberal viewpoint. The assignments and readings are all based off extreme liberal ideology. The papers must be argued from this viewpoint as well. The class is great if you want to learn about policy from this standpoint, but I advise taking this class with caution.</comment>This class is an utter and complete failure. These two people just love to hear the sound of their own voices. They stand at the head of class and spew off all sorts of crap that is unfounded and utterly stupid. Somehow they will find a way to blame societies problems on the middle class and people who try to help themselves.</comment>Although the material is easy, I found the grading to be subpar.</comment>I absolutely loved this class. All the subject matter is relevant and interesting, and the coursework is very manageable.</comment>The assignments are very broad and the teaching staff expects you to confront major issues with countless moving parts in relatively short assignments.</comment>Take it just heads up for very hard grading on the papers</comment>A moderately difficult class on relevant and important material taught by all-stars with a great reading list. Worst case, you'll cruise through it and pick up enough information to become a better informed citizen. Thing is, the best case isn't that much better than that, because the course is extremely expansive in subject matter, which sacrifices detail and thematic clarity. Still, much better way to get your US in the World than Ec 10.</comment>This class has been one of the most eye-opening classes I've taken: you learn the many, many ways that America has failed this generation and what has led up to that. Readings are long but mostly interesting, and lectures can be presented in a somewhat dry manner, but the subject matter makes up for it. The class was harder than I expected, for a Gen Ed, but definitely rewarding.</comment>A lot of reading that is necessary only for midterm. Interesting material that is worth learning about to be a well-informed citizen. Essays graded moderately hard. Not an easy A Gen Ed by any means.</comment>Not a huge fan of the essay topics, but there were only 2 papers which was good. This class taught me that I don't think thinking about public policy unless it's about why certain existing public policies only benefit the wealthy. If you take this class, you will learn a lot about how everything is stacked for the top .01% which is pretty interesting. But I generally did not enjoy writing essays for this class because I'm fairly politically apathetic. I took this class as a sociology requirement, not realizing that it also double counts for government, which meant that politics made up 50% of class materials.</comment>This is an awesome course if you're interested in getting involved in politics or if you just want to gain a greater understanding of current events. Professor Skocpol and Professor Waters are super knowledgeable and work hard to involve students in the discussion during lectures, and Tom is one of the greatest TFs you'll have at Harvard. The assignments are manageable and pretty interesting because they let you explore topics that you find most appealing, and the readings aren't overly time-consuming (and the course is a lot more enjoyable and you'll learn a lot more if you actually do the readings). Definitely recommend this to anybody needing a USW or a credit for the GHHP secondary, or if you're just interested in learning more about public policy!</comment>This class teaches you how to be a productive, informed citizen of the US. You will walk away with a better understanding of the US government, and our country compared to the world.</comment>It's a great class and you'll learn a ton about issues facing American politics and society. It's an especially interesting class if you're at all interested in inequality and the workload is very reasonable.</comment>Skocpol's lectures are extremely dry, but Mary Waters's are more engaging. Margot is great and even though I wasn't in his section, Tom seems great, too. 

As for the course material, it's honestly just a survey of topics that appear in modern politics. Okay gen-ed. Definitely among the least exciting courses I've taken at Harvard, but I suppose it's an okay way to do your USW. That would be the keyword, I guess: okay.</comment>If you've taken sociology courses before this course has a lot of crossover and not necessarily in a way that illuminates your understanding of the topics. Rather I felt I was not being taught new ways of looking at these issues but being told what the issues were and forced to come up with solutions that seemed insincere.</comment>This class presents a useful one-sided view of American policy.  Ideally, it could be able to better balance both sides of the political spectrum. It would be better if the final was a traditional 3 hour final.</comment>A very oversimplified view of public policy. We got tons of information that was scattered and failed to point to a general picture. The professors are not effective lecturers, and I found myself getting very bored, both with them and the readings.</comment>I strongly recommend this course if you have an interest in domestic policy.</comment>The class isn't perfect, but I genuinely learned a lot about US social policy by the end of it. If that's what you want to get out of the class, then it's a great option.</comment>This class is awesome. You learn about issues facing american society, and the political components of these issues, all with historical or comparative context.</comment>Get Tom as your TF! He's the best. Class is an interesting survey of important American issues but there is a strong liberal bias in lecture and the readings chosen.</comment>I was surprised by how much I loved this class! I had never taken a class on domestic policy before and am SO glad that I did. I feel like now I am a much more educated citizen, and I can actually participate intelligently in conversations about major social issues facing the US. I expected that the course would have a significant liberal bias, and it could have used some more balanced readings in my opinion, but I still learned so much---the professors and TFs are incredible.</comment>Great to know about these inequalities that plague our country and how we might go about fixing them.  There's a fair share of liberal bias/BS that inundates the class at times, but as long as students are able to think critically and form their own intelligent opinions it is still a great class.</comment>This is a great class to fill the USW requirement. I really liked the emphasis this class placed on data.</comment>Good survey course of recent public policy. Those who come in with a strong background in the class' policy areas dominate the class. The assignments were not too challenging, but the midterm drew on very specific information that just takes memorizing, but we weren't given a heads up for. Make sure you do the readings if they keep up with section reading quizzes. Very liberal lectures and skewed descriptions of public policies.</comment>I would say that it is an excellent course if you have no previous knowledge regarding US public policy and are looking to fill that gap. It is effective in its ability to cover a many very important aspects of it in great detail. It requires time in order to do the weekly readings as I found these readings essential to gaining a good understanding of the material.</comment>The course is, straightforwardly, what you would expect it to be. It offers, from an admittedly far left viewpoint, an exploration of policies relating to immigration, higher education, income inequality, and healthcare (the class spends about two weeks on each topic). The professors are very liberal and opinionated, so you may only be getting one side of the picture, but Waters and Skocpol are very knowledgable and offer compelling arguments critiquing current policies. It's not an easy GenEd, but at the same time it isn't a ton of work either.</comment>The material of this course is really interesting! You should really read the material and try to participate as much as possible to get the most out of this class.</comment></course>OEB 114: Vertebrate Viviparity</title>One of my favorite courses at Harvard. So interesting and engaging. Absolutely take this class if you're at all interested in biology; it makes you think about biology from a completely different perspective than any other biology class I've taken. Not a huge workload, just fascinating material and plenty of leeway to explore your own interesting topics in a term paper. Highly recommend.</comment>Take it! Haig is amazing and it is a low workload. The final paper might seem long, but there is so much flexibility that it's a lot of fun.</comment>Class was a pleasure to attend. The lectures were engaging and readings interesting. I highly recommend this class to not only people interested in evolutionary biology, but also those who are interested in game theory.</comment>I don't think I've ever learned so much in one class. Every lecture was full of amazing (and sometimes shocking!) facts about vertebrate reproduction and parenting behavior. The structure of this class is a bit different from others, since there is no formal section but instead a "Fundamental Interconnectedness of All Things" (FIAT) session on Fridays in which Professor Haig answered any questions that had come up over the course of the week. There are also very few assignments--only an in class midterm, term paper, and final. The exams were very fair, and the term paper was a great opportunity to explore a topic from the class in more depth. Really, anyone who enjoys learning cool animal (including human) facts would love this class!</comment>This is an good course if you need to fulfill an OEB requirement and you need a break from psetting.</comment>If you go through OEB without taking a class with David Haig, you're missing out.</comment>David Haig is an amazing person to get to know and listen to.  Having the opportunity to learn about viviparity in a wide variety of animals is really awesome.  Add the fact that you get to learn about viviparity with David Haig, and it makes it an awesome experience.  It's a pretty chill class, and it depends on how engaged the students are (the more questions, the better).</comment>The lectures in this class are super cool. Very little work, definitely worth taking!</comment>This is an awesome class! The tests were really short, but Professor Haig knows and covers so much in the semester. It's really interesting material, but it isn't too much.</comment>The workload is just one 10-page paper about basically whatever relevant topic interests you. Loved that. And then the final exam is 40% of your grade and you have no idea which of the various random topics from lecture will show up on it. Take this if you wanna hear about some really interesting things and then have no idea how to study the material. But still take it because it's cool.</comment>Straightforward. Interesting material.</comment>It's a great introduction to a lot of interesting facts and phenomenon that occur in vertebrate viviparity. Genomic imprinting and maternal-offspring conflict are incredibly cool, and learning random facts about tons of animals is really fun as well.</comment>Prof. Haig is wonderful and knows so much about so many different things.  Take this class-- it is amazing to have the opportunity to learn from him!</comment></course>PHIL 164: Metaphysics</title>Great class. Ned is fantastic, as always, and Kate Vredenburgh is an excellent TF! The readings are sometimes difficult, but the introductory text is very helpful. The assignments aren't always the most engaging, but they're very helpful in improving your philosophical writing and argumentation. Sometimes the class felt disconnected, jumping between issues, and not really united until the end. Overall, what you would expect from an upper level philosophy class. If you like philosophy, definitely take it.</comment>This class is all-around great-- the readings are challenging but rewarding, the assignments are difficult but thought-provoking, and class itself is an ideal combination of lecture and discussion. Ned is great at not only synthesizing the ideas from the reading and presenting them to the class along with commentary, but also at facilitating discussion-- at any point during the "lecture," you can ask questions or make comments, and Ned is also really great about identifying the essential point of your question and answering it in a way that provokes further thought about the ideas and readings.</comment>This class is brilliant! There exists a possible world, w1, where Ned's the coolest tenured professor teaching philosophy and I suspect w1 is not that far away from the actual world.</comment>THIS IS THE BEST COURSE EVER.</comment>Personally, I find the high level of abstraction characteristic of metaphysics to be pretty fun on its own, but I think the greatest strength of this course is Ned's ability to make completely explicit the connections between metaphysics and other, more concrete domains of human life and thought like ethics, science, etc.</comment>This class is really difficult.The readings are really tough -- dense and nuanced -- and there are lot of difficult concepts to grasp. That said, Ned and Kate are both amazing -- really accessible and committed to student growth. Overall, I think one would have gotten more out of this course having taken more philosophy classes beforehand, and I recommend waiting until junior or senior year (I am a sophomore, and although I've already taken 2-3 philosophy classes, I still felt somewhat unprepared for this class and did not get as much out of it as I think I might have if I had waited).</comment>Take this class! Ned and Kate are thoughtful, sincere, genuinely lovely human beings, and they care 100% about you (your academic achievement, your happiness, and your well-being). The material is very interesting and touches on a lot of different areas in philosophy. The course is challenging without stupefying, and the community is great--you get to know your classmates so much better than in other courses, and the philosophical discussions that result are truly meaningful.</comment>Not an *amazing* class, but a solid one nonetheless, and there's no reason not to take it if you're already inclined towards the field/the material. Especially if Ned's teaching it you should highly consider this class – he's a great guy and a good teacher.</comment>It's a good class. You'll get a lot out if you put a lot in.</comment>Ned is an amazing instructor, so any class with him is guaranteed to be awesome. This class is no exception. Be prepared to engage with really really abstract ideas though. If you need things grounded in some kind of obvious practical application, this might not be for you.</comment>This is the best class I have taken at Harvard. You must take it!</comment></course>WOMGEN 1249: Gender in African History</title>The class is great because it stretches one's understanding of how gender operates in African nations. Meghan does a great job of setting out to truly cover the entire continent including the different types of societies but she definitely does have a bias for sub-saharan Africa and Bantu cultures. The class was eye-opening and it does everything I as a non-WGS concentrator would hope to get out of it. I am now more aware about gender and will try to be extra conscious and sensitive to how my decisions and understanding of the world may be gendered.</comment>This class is solid and well-taught. Meghan brings a sense of direction to class discussions that leads to tangible things being learned that I feel missing from a lot of the discussion classes that I am in. Furthermore, the readings are really interesting and cover a wide range of places on the continent and wide range of periods and topics related to gender. Furthermore, the final project gives you a lot of freedom to develop an idea that interests which is really fun. You'll enjoy it.</comment>This course is a great introduction to the way women have played a role in African history. You get to learn about how African women's role in society has evolved over time and how women were affected by the introduction of colonialism. We also tackled major questions addressing how women can have such different roles within and outside of the household in many African societies. Overall, this is a great way to get exposed to the histories and experiences of a demograph that is often overlooked.</comment>This class sort of lags at times and sometimes I was lost by the density of the readings and the great expanse of the subject material.</comment>It's really important to read everything thoroughly, and I would recommend keeping good notes to ensure that you remember readings from past weeks.</comment>Wonderful course. Dr. H-C is an incredible instructor invested in actually teaching students instead of just leading discussion. This course covers plenty of case studies that would be interesting to both africanists and newcomers to the field!</comment>This is a great class! Meghan is absolutely wonderful, and does a really good job of balancing information-sharing with facilitating discussion. The readings are fascinating, and will really challenge your conceptions of African history and, honestly, history more generally.</comment>If you think you are interested in issues on gender but you dont have the background knowledge please take this class. It provides a good introduction and analysis of various gendered issues without necessarily dumbing things down. The professor is readily available and AMAZING!! The small size of the class makes it so that you can freely participate and actually get to know the other people in your class. Honestly, I had an amazing time in this class!</comment>The class is great and explores a lot of issues about African culture. Tends to be a little biased towards women as is typical of most gender classes but this also creates a great narrative to synthesize the status of men as well.</comment></course>BCMP 230: Principles and Practice of Drug Development</title>The class comprises guest lecturers ranging from researchers to financial advisers of pharmaceutical companies. Based on your interests, you may find a few of the lectures pretty boring.</comment>If you want to learn about a wide range of topics in life sciences and biotechnology from rockstars of the field, take this class.</comment>It's a great class that covers many different aspects of the world of big pharma (and little pharma!). The final project was really interesting but it's all about how much effort to put into it -- if you're interested in your topic, you'll end up spending more time on it than you think you will. The professors are great and are interested in making you as a student interested in the material. The lecturers are also quite good and they come from all over.</comment>Enticing as the course title sounds, you are unlikely to learn anything substantive. There are no principles to be found (aside from the point, repeated only a few dozen times, that drug development costs are exponentially increasing). The lectures are unbearably long, the projects almost universally juvenile or uncreative, the assignments tedious. Not worth the travel to MIT. I'm 95% convinced this class exists as a so-called gentleman's agreement between students who don't want to have to learn and professors who're too busy (or jaded) to actually teach. That poor TF.</comment>The class gives a great insight into the state of drug development and the pharmaceutical industry. The great guest lecturers provide many different perspectives.</comment>Very laid-back but incredibly interesting</comment>If you're at all interested in the pharmaceutical industry, this is a low workload class that offers A LOT of information and the ability to meet many many important people. You get out what you put in mainly.</comment>the speakers and topics are great, but you will learn the most by interacting with other students.</comment>Great lectures on a number of directly relevant topics if you see yourself working in biopharma someday -- very much a case of "you'll get as much out of this class as you choose to put into it". The heavy emphasis on the group project (65% of grade) is painful, though.</comment>It's a great way to experience current events in the pharma/biotech world by listening to the innovators themselves. I learned a whole lot, and had a fun time doing it. If you're worried about grades, then don't be intimidated by the two presentations and final report. They are completed in teams, and as long as you pace yourself, you can get a solid grade without being overstressed.</comment></course>HEB 1424: Human Health in Evolutionary and Anthropological Perspective</title>class discussion was great and the material was really cool. definitely relevant for pre-med students, but interesting for anyone.</comment>This class can be a great way to view health from an evolutionary lens. The readings are also really great and discussions are super engaging.</comment>Just do the readings and you'll enjoy the class!</comment>The workload in this class in manageable with a few hours of reading per week and one midterm. The end of the class can be challenging with a final paper, presentation, and exam.</comment>I loved this class! If you're interested in why humans evolved various traits that make us vulnerable to disease, you will love this class. Though there is a short paper, midterm, final paper, and final, the weekly workload isn't bad, and all the readings are extremely interesting. I highly recommend this class!</comment>The material presented in this course is really interesting and is supplemented with a good deal in class. That being said, it often does not feel like the most exciting course which is strange given the interesting subject matter. I hope that there are changes in the assignments and structure of the course that allow you to think more critically and memorize less. If you take a look at the syllabus and it appeals to you, I would definitely take the class--you won't be disappointed with what you come out knowing.</comment></course>ENGLISH 90hb: Four Shakespeare Plays: Seminar</title>It's very unfocused and no one really ever knows what's going on. Shell is absolutely brilliant, but you may go an entire lecture without opening a text. I never received a grade on anything or had any indication of how I was performing. Take it for the stories - not for Shakespeare.</comment>This is not your traditional Shakespeare class - you will learn about Shakespeare via very unconventional routes like kinship, race, economics, etc. The workload is light so it's a very manageable course, but you have to be willing to participate in discussions and it can be an interesting class if you want to study Shakespeare beyond what you'd learn in a typical English class.</comment>You won't get any feedback on this course, which is both disconcerting and mildly reassuring. Discussions are digressive but interesting. Most of them center around how unstable language is, which was fascinating. Shell is a genius, and you should definitely talk to him about him outside of class.</comment>If you need a seminar or a Shakespeare class for your English major, this is a very solid option - just good luck getting a straight answer out of Professor Shell.</comment>Shell is one of the most fascinating people I've ever been in a room with. I am not sure whether I am coming out of the class able to do the kind of work he can do, but maybe I'm on the road towards that. I'm not sure this is a class in literature, actually. It frequently felt polemical. It seems to have been a class, to some extent, in skepticism (small "s") and Socratic-style poking at notions and in the instability of categories and the pliability, like 2-ply toilet paper, of language. It got at some pretty serious problems as well, skirting the boundaries of political correctness, and at one point in the semester the discussion got pretty heated in a way that I don't think has ever happened in one of Harvard's businesslike 'seminars' to me before.   All that gushing aside, though, there are caveats: poor email communication, and virtually no feedback on written work.   Take it, because it's weird and fun and anxiety-producing. I'm not exactly sure what you should expect to come out of it with, though. Trouble, and a thought stuck like a song in your head.</comment></course>ANTHRO 98za: Junior Tutorial in Social Anthropology</title>The course is fairly unstructured, definitely what you make of it. You can get a lot out of it depending on how seriously you take the weekly assignments, though. Many of the assignments are very ambiguous and unstructured, indicating some level of disorganization within the department or the teaching staff for the course, though.</comment>This class is really enjoyable and also super helpful in teaching you what anthropology is and also how to design and carry out research. The atmosphere is also really relaxed so you don't feel stressed but you still learn a lot. I also really liked that the class balanced very well giving us enough independence to pursue ideas that interested us while also providing a lot of support and supervision as we developed our research projects. Even if you are not writing a senior thesis, this class would be super useful in helping you decide if you are on the fence but also is really useful in helping you build up your reading and writing skills. If you are writing a senior thesis, it is wonderful because it gives you a headstart by over a year over a lot of other fields which is really nice.</comment>The concepts covered in this class are amazing, but just be ready for busy work.</comment>This class is an excellent class to start building your thesis topic.</comment>Just be aware that if your version of this course is anything like the version I took, this will be an extremely time-consuming course with very high expectations for the amount of reading and writing students will do. If possible, I would highly recommend scheduling some easier courses when you take this course; I think even if I were only taking this course and had no extracurriculars, I would still have a difficult time completely finishing all of the work that was asked of me.</comment>As a space where you can give and receive feedback without hesitation from your classmates, this tutorial has proved to be amazing. You will find that everyone has crazy awesome ideas and plans for their research and I found myself looking forward to hearing everyone's progress. However, as a class with weekly writing assignments and biweekly one-on-one feedback sessions with the TF, this has been one huge disappointment. I came into this class with a lot of excitement and enthusiasm for my potential thesis topic but I left with a feeling of tedium and exhaustion from the repetitive assignments and impractical advice on my research topic. I think I learned more from being around my classmates and discussing our topics than actually speaking with the TF despite the mandatory biweekly meetings which weren't even all that useful.</comment>Pick your topic early (you sort of have to). The class has two final paper options: 20 page senior thesis proposal or an ethnographic research paper, but the class is more geared towards the first option (maybe they will change it in subsequent iterations of the class). For the final paper, know the theories you will use. The theoretical underpinnings behind your own topic are not discussed in depth throughout the course, but towards the end and in your final paper, they are essential.</comment>Emrah is an INCREDIBLE tutorial leader. Also really use this course as an opportunity to do some deep thinking and planning about your thesis research.</comment>Read a book a week, and figure out what ethnography means early on.</comment>It gives you introduction to work in anthropology and, if you want, thesis preparation. My friends from other departments were surprised to hear how meticulous and thoughtful the preparation is - and jealous, too. The more ideas and other courses in anthropology, the better you would be able to take out of the course.</comment>This class is great to truly delve into the process of developing an anthropology research question, reading the relevant literature, and discussing with other students.  By the end I felt more prepared to take on a thesis project.  The best part is hearing what other students are interested in and working on (and to be honest, it's probably one of the best parts about anthropology--the diverse and cool interests of other students).  Ramyar is also a great tutorial leader who will guide you and keep you on track.</comment>It all geared to making you write a thesis, whether you want to or not.</comment>This class is an excellent opportunity to learn about how to create a research project through extensive writing assignments as well as interesting conversations with knowledgeable graduate students and peers.</comment></course>HIST 89h: Henry Kissinger: Statecraft in Theory and Practice</title>Kissinger is one of the most fascinating individuals in history to study and this class will teach you a great deal about how to conduct a successful foreign policy and what it takes to be a statesman.</comment>Great class! Learned a lot about strategic thinking and foreign policy in the 1960s/70s. Professor Ferguson is an incredible lecturer and educator. If you haven't, you should definitely take a class with him before you graduate.</comment>Best class at Harvard. It's a pretty unbelievable class if you can get in and a high-powered discussion every week that you have to be on your game for. Try to soak as much of discussion in as you can. Ferguson and your classmates have a lot of interesting things to say about the matter, and you're going to learn a lot of interesting viewpoints of how foreign policy was conducted (and still is today). The relevancy that Ferguson brings is quite cool and exciting for a history concentrator to see. We also had the opportunity to meet Dr. Kissinger in New York, which was mind-blowing after reading so much about him.</comment>A great class. Ferguson is in his element in this class. Be prepared to do a lot of reading though.</comment>Take this class. Professor Ferguson is fabulous, and here he is a teaching a subject about which he is the foremost expert. The other students in the seminar are also excellent, and everyone is working to gain a better understanding of the subject matter, and to improve themselves as academics. That, and there is a possibility of going to New York to actually meet with Henry Kissinger. Do the readings, figure out what each reading is trying to say, and be sure to contribute to discussion; it's fun and you'll receive great feedback. Overall, this class has been one of my favorite academic experiences at Harvard.</comment>This class is incredible, but just make sure you are ok with the time required - it is substantially more work than other similar seminars. That being said, this class was one of the highlights of my time at Harvard, so definitely take it if you can.</comment>You are offered the opportunity to learn about the most important person in American foreign policy. This class teaches you more about how to think about foreign policy and American values than any other class I've encountered.</comment>If you love history and are up for a challenge, Professor Ferguson is your man. This is an incredible class.</comment>If there is ever a course that you should try to take, it's this one. Prof. Ferguson is brilliant and an incredible teacher. The topic is fascinating, the discussions are as well, and meeting Dr. Kissinger himself at the end of the semester was an experience that I will never forget.</comment>TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! Hands down my favorite course at Harvard so far. It's fascinating to learn about Dr. Kissinger's theory on world order and how he applies it to the practice of foreign policy decision making. What course can be better than a seminar taught by Professor Ferguson on one of the most influential and controversial political figures of the 20th century? 
Be ready to do lots of heavy reading.</comment></course>FRSEMR 26k: Transformative ideas in brain science and neuroscience: how war, technology, and disease have illuminated the organization and function of the nervous system historically and today</title>This course isn't really a science course. If you want to take a history of science course though, then is really great. Just make sure you're expecting to learn about the history of the brain and not the brain itself.</comment>One thing that initially disappointed me was that this is not really a science class. It is more like a history of science seminar. That being said, a lot of the readings were interesting (especially the later ones) and you could learn information about the brain and about the changing paradigms in the scientific world. The readings and discussions of this class often demonstrate the cyclic nature of scientific discovery and advancements. Many of the ideas in the first few classes keep coming back in the readings and in discussions because that is what the scientific community was experiencing; previously rejected ideas about neuroscience often had renewed relevance. Overall, I would say it is a good seminar for noticing important trends relating to neuroscience but not for learning hard, scientific facts about the brain.</comment>Wonderful window into the world of neuroscience, and a must for anyone interested in history or neurobiology.</comment>The class is taught by an excellent professor and the information is wholly intriguing; however, I would say that, in order to reap the full benefits of the class, you need to have a solid group of participants. Otherwise, the same themes become the focus of the entire class.</comment>Only take this course if you are interested in history. Understand that this is not a neuroscience course, but one on the history of how neuroscience progressed to where it is today. You will only spend one class discussing actual current science. That being said, I learned a lot of history that I might not otherwise have learned.</comment>This is a great class if you think you may be interested in neurology or history of science. You'll learn a lot, but not too much in depth.</comment>This class is the quintessential Harvard freshman seminar experience. Dr. Macklis is a brilliant neuroscientist, a fantastic historian, and an extremely approachable mentor. In addition to seminar-style discussions, your 3,000-year journey through the evolution of key ideas in neuroscience will be punctuated by multiple memorable field trips. Visits to the museum of comparative zoology, the medical school's anatomical museum, the Herbarium, and the Harvard fMRI lab are the highlights of the course. The workload is light, though weekly readings are overly dry and scientific on occasion. Nevertheless, this course is a shining star among the many quality seminar options.</comment></course>EXPOS 20.136: The Body in Art: From Ideal to Real</title>This class was very comprehensive and allowed me to gain a lot of analytical skills that I did not have in the past when looking at art. Or naked people.</comment>This class had a large variance between workload throughout the semester. When essay deadlines were close, I often spent hours and hours writing and perfecting my writing. When there were no essays due for the while and assignments mainly involved reading, the class was low stress. Be warned, however, that the class is quite art intensive. For a person like me who is not particularly inclined towards art, I found the class to be difficult at times and could not come up with an appropriate thesis that was critical or relevant enough. The teacher was very prompt in answering emails, gave ample and helpful feedback after drafts, and was willing to help during office hours. While I found the class to be challenging at times, I do think that it helped my writing overall is definitely not impossible.</comment>There aren't a lot of readings in this course compared to other expos classes which is good, but if you have no interest in art or do not have an eye for art the class may seem boring or unpleasant.</comment>This class is a good expos if you are at all interested in art or art history. It gives a good background on how to approach all types of art, not just nude art. Professor De Young also does a very good job of helping to improve your writing skills and I feel much more able now in my ability to write more comprehensive essays.</comment>Definitely take this class if you have any interest in art or art history or the portrayal of the body. Readings and daily assignments are very doable--they are interesting and never dense or very long. Professor De Young is incredibly enthusiastic about the subject matter and provides really in depth, thoughtful feedback. The course's focus and subject matter does not vary greatly throughout the semester; do not take this class if you dislike interpreting art or discussing nudity (which there is a lot of!) Overall, this was one of my favorite courses this semester and a very painless way to fulfill the Expos requirement.</comment>It's a great class if you want to write papers analyzing art, as I don't think there are many other Expos classes the would give you that opportunity. Prof. De Young is a little eccentric but overall really knows her stuff and is good to work with.</comment>This class can get awkward at times, but that's when it gets fun.</comment>This class may be doable if you are good with time management, but if you are looking for an easy expos writing course with a low time commitment, this is not the course.</comment>If the topic sounds interesting to you, take this course! The visual element will probably make whatever workload you'll have much more well-rounded, and the eccentricity of dealing with nudes and nudity was a nice break from all the generic intro courses.</comment>If you like art, take it. If you don't, just don't even consider. The workload is significantly higher than for other expos. Also the writing book assigned is incredibly boring, filled with truisms.</comment>Be prepared to do a lot of work for very little. But also to actually do your readings as we talk about them every class.</comment>This course is probably the most unique Expos you can take. I would recommend this class to someone who is looking for a way to complete their Expos requirement and wants something completely different from their other classes. I would not recommend this as something you take because you think it would be funny to take a class on nude art.</comment></course>MATH 145a: Set Theory I</title>You will learn a lot of set theory. It's tough, but really cool.</comment>For anyone who is interested in the subject matter, I recommend this class without reservation or hesitation. The class is very small (it was this year, anyways) and lectures feel a lot more like a conversation with the professor Koellner. Problem sets are reasonable, and the subject matter is really interesting and well-explained. Often I leave a math class feeling like I have a surface understanding of the material, enough to do the homework but not a particularly deep understanding. Math 145a did not feel this way at all. Overall a great class.  Also, forcing is insanely cool.</comment></course>AFRAMER 90r.g: Haitian Creole</title>Prof. Lesly is an amazing teacher--be prepared to learn a lot!!</comment>Very great hands-on learning.</comment>It is a great experience if you are prepared to not have as much structure as the typical language course.</comment>-It was a great corse becuase Lesly is like an open encyopledua he knows so much about the Haitian culture, Ask him anything. Push him to focus on grammar and writing if that is something you struggle with.</comment>Learn Haitian Kreyol! Very useful in Boston, even if you never go to Haiti.</comment>This is truly a remarkable (and easy) class. You really learn Haitian Creole quite quickly, but keeping up isn't ever a problem. Lesly is an amazing teacher who emphasizes listening and speaking from the very beginning, correcting mistakes over the course of the class in both a lenient and encouraging manner. This is a HUGE help to learning the language. The class is a bit disorganized and assignments are sometimes late to come, but this isn't usually a major source of stress. I recommend taking it if you want to have a fun, laid-back class for your schedule and if you really want to learn a language well!</comment></course>E&M-REASON 17: Deductive Logic</title>This class is extremely useful! Not too time consuming, but fun and helpful for building critical thinking.</comment>This class should serve as a warning to not place too much emphasis on previous years' Q guide entries. The professor this semester changed almost the entire course. The quizzes were immensely more difficult than the prior year, and there was a huge disconnect between the material in lecture and the quizzes. The quizzes were unyielding. They were supposed to take about 30 minutes, but a large number of students used the entire 2 hour period on Fridays to take the quiz. This course was supposed to be a Gen Ed but certainly didn't feel like it. That said I do feel like I learned Logic well (but only because of Ronni and Diana, a.k.a. the BEST teaching fellows at Harvard). I'd recommend to take with Ned Hall if he's teaching it, otherwise only take if you truly enjoy logic and are okay with a challenge.   Additionally, here are my comments regarding Mark Richard:  "Let me preface this by saying that Professor Richard gives amazing lectures. I absolutely adored every lecture, especially the divergent lectures about philosophers and their differing interpretations of logic (Professor Richard and I both share a love of Bertrand Russell, arguably the greatest philosopher of all time).   However, Professor Richard created the most inane, difficult quizzes that were almost completely unrelated to the lecture material. This course was supposed to be a Gen Ed, but he had us doing incredibly hard proofs on quizzes (seriously, one proof on a quiz took me 45 minutes and 30 lines to complete). This was not advertised for the course. I put a lot of time into this course and attended many sections and office hours; however, I still found myself confused each quiz. The questions seemed to not so much "test our mastery of the material", but rather to purposefully deceive us.   Also, the grading for quizzes was, in my opinion, unfair. My worst quiz I received a 76. This was dropped (thank god!), but it was (in my opinion) an unfair score to begin with. I missed 3 questions and lost 8 points for each one. One of the questions I simply forgot to introduce a negation to a quantified sentence. Another question I forgot to clarify that the "x" in my paraphrase was a person. And the third question I forgot to specify a minute part of an extension (but otherwise my formula was correct). I fail to see how this merits a 76, specifically when I correctly answered so many other questions on the quiz. Perhaps if I would have had more time then I wouldn't have lost points, but either way the quizzes are created and graded unfairly."</comment>The subject matter is interesting, but doing well on quizzes requires a lot of individual work and some of it just feels like random chance. The professor is clearly knowledgeable but sometimes lectures are very poorly organized and the class as a whole suffers from a lack of clear connection between vague concepts covered in lecture and the concrete applications you will be tested on.</comment>This is a great option for students who are considering concentrations in Mathematics and Computer Science.</comment>For philosophy concentrators, this is not a bad class to take to fulfill the logic requirement. If you already think analytically, it will be too difficult to adjust the symbolic logic used.</comment>Take this class with a different professor than Richard.</comment>Listen well, all of you. 

You’d think logic would be easy since it’s, you know, logical. You’d be wrong. 

You deserve a fair warning that this class might very well chew you up and spit you out. You have to be constantly vigilant that you’re keeping up with the material and mastering every step of it along the way. Individually, each new section of the material isn’t actually that hard at all, it’s just the pace at which you’re expected to master the material that makes the course challenging. 

*The Book* The textbook (Goldfarb) is actually surprisingly clear. Though techinically you don’t even have to read the book to survive the class (I stopped reading it all together half-way through) I highly recommend you do so, and that you do so BEFORE lecture. You do not want to be hearing the material from the Professor for the first time in lecture because it’s nigh impossible to follow lecture like that. Also, for those of you who haven’t discovered this already, if you’re using Goldfarb’s textbook you can easily find a pdf of it online for free, so don’t bother buying it and then lugging a physical copy around all the time.

*Quizzes* Now, keep in mind this only applies if Professor Richard is teaching the class.  The “quizzes” are not quizzes. They are tests. Any “quiz” which takes two hours to complete is a test, if you ask me, and you have one every single Friday. Richard says he designs the quizzes to only take an hour, but that you have the full two hours if you need it. That’s nice, except these are by no means one-hour quizzes. I (and much of the rest of the class) consistenly needed the full two hours to finish, and many many many of these instances were extremely close-calls as to whether or not I would finish on time. If you figure that a final takes 3 hours to complete and that these quizzes take 2 hours, please trust me when I say that you need to prepare ferociously to survive them. 


*Homework* They say the homework is optional, and technically it is, but it is absolutely NOT optional if you value your life. Professor Richard said he designs the homework to best prepare you for the quiz. On the one hand, no information that wasn’t on the homework will show up on the quiz. HOWEVER the quizzes ARE ALWAYS MUCH MUCH HARDER than the homework, and so the homework is not always an adequate preparation for the quizzes. Fair warning. Ask Richard for harder homework. 

*Section* Again. They say section is optional, but that’s a lie. Go to section. Go to section twice. Go to section thrice. You neeeeed to see the material in action from the TF if you want to survive the quiz. Do it. You will only thank me. 


Now. I know the class must sound scary at this point, but I should say that I actually had a blast. Sure, the paralyzing anxiety of the quizzes will drive you mad every Thursday night as you scramble to stuff your brain with last minute preparation, but I have to admit that there’s a small, masochistic part of me that actually enjoyed the struggle. It’s quite fun because technically everything is logical, and each brush with frustration is actually making you a more rational and reasonable thinker. The answer is already there, you just have to find it. Also, if Ronni is your TF, praise the gods. I can say with absolutely certainty that I would not have survived the class without her. If she’s not teaching it your year, you need to contact her (Ronni Sadovsky) and ask her for her materials. That is all. Good luck.</comment>If you are a logician at present, take this course. If not, and you want to learn the systems of deductive logic, do not take this course. It prioritizes students who understand the subject matter intuitively, grades are based only on quizzes/exams, and psets/section are optional.</comment>This course is tremendously interesting, though there is a huge amount of material and it moves at a quick pace. There are weekly "quizzes" that are, in fact, not quizzes at all, but rather two-hour exams that are rigorous and require extensive preparation. If you are willing to invest time and effort, this is an excellent course. I would not, however, take it as a way to fulfil the EMR GenEd. You will be frustrated at points, but will thank yourself at the end. As a bonus, Prof. Richard is a funny guy and makes class light-hearted with his jokes.</comment>Do not take this class if you're looking for a simple way to fulfill the EMR gen-ed. It is not worth the hassle and work. You get very little from the class, but spend a lot of time doing the work.</comment>If Richard's teaching it, don't take this course. I thought logic would help me construct arguments and think more rigorously outside the class. In reality, you stop using the English language in any meaningful way a few weeks in, and focus on how (what feel like incredibly esoteric) logical languages work. Richard made lectures painful, in that his explanations only ever made things more obscure. He can't relate to students at all, and in lecture would make mistakes and get himself confused to the point that you couldn't stay focused on what you were actually supposed to be learning. He didn't seem like he wanted to be there, and made me not want to be there either. And because he seemed to only put in the minimal effort, I did the same.</comment>Excellent course for developing logical thinking skills. For instance, it is a course that I would recommend someone take first before enrolling in a higher level math class (100 and above). For this class provides a solid foundation on the logic employed in these classes.</comment>If you enjoy the professor and aren't familiar with most of the material already, by all means take this class.</comment>I would definitely recommend taking this course. It is a great class to take even for people who are not concentrating in Philosophy, especially if you have a somewhat quantitative background. The TFs are a great resource - be sure to go to section and to reach out to them if you have any questions!</comment>If it's not Prof Richard (with all due respect and without intending anything personally) then I recommend this. [That's a conditional statement, by the way.]</comment>I would recommend the class but, honestly, only if a different professor were to teach it. Again, TF's were wonderful, but they shouldn't have to carry the class.</comment>Take this course. Easy enough to get a great grade but challenging enough that you actually learn about the material. But don't take it if Mark Richard is teaching it.</comment>More than most classes, I think this class lends itself to the "you either get it or you don't" style of learning. It's hard to say what sorts of people will "get it", but I imagine those who are more science or philosophy oriented will fall into this category. That's not to say you can't do well as a Freshman thinking about doing English (just to take a random example). This class has all the tools to help you do well, and it isn't graded a curve per se, so everyone can do well. The advantage of this class is that you can put in as much effort as you want. The homework is optional but extremely useful for quizzes, so you can always do well on quizzes if you spend time understanding the homework!</comment>Deductive logic is an excellent class, and I'd recommend with enthusiasm. I took this as an elective because so many friends recommended it from years before. I wasn't disappointed at all. This class applies the logical reasoning you learn in math and cs classes to language, which is quite astonishing. This is also a wonderful class if you hope to be a philosophy concentrator. One piece of advice is that contrary to other classes, this class is one where it's good to start the hws late. I would work on them the day before the quiz. The reason is that there's always mistakes with the proof checker website so by the time it's the day before the quiz, these kinks will have been already worked out. Otherwise, working on the hw early may lead to hours on end staring at the computer as to why your answer doesn't work, when it should. Have fun!</comment>This class is great!  I loved the material.  However, it could be taught a lot better, I really didn't pay attention in lectures at all.  But really, the material made it all worth it.</comment>Good, low-stress class.  The material is relatively straightforward and can be very interesting.</comment>I took this course because I read the Q guide from the previous administration of the course and was impressed by the comments and reviews it received; I was sorely disappointed when I found that very little of this praise applied, except for the teaching fellows who continued to be incredibly invested and helpful.  The positive reviews of previous offerings of this course leads me to believe that EMR17 could be a great experience in the future so I would not rule it out but only if it has been taught by one of the professors who taught it before 2014. Ronni and Diana were GREAT TFs-- the best TFs I've had at Harvard because of their dedication to compensating for the lack of clarity in lectures and the errors in the homework answer key that was submitted to the website. I did not think that the effort that I put into the course was reflected in my performance in the course; the quizzes often did not match the material that was emphasized/covered in the homework assignments. I've never given a course below a 4 on the Q guide so my experience in this course was especially disappointing.</comment>If you're looking for an easy GenEd, don't take this course with Mark Richard. If you're looking for an interesting and slightly challenging GenEd, you probably shouldn't take this course with Mark Richard. If mathematical reasoning is an intuitive activity for you and you'd like to immerse yourself in its nuances, you might want to take this course. At times, Mark Richard's lectures could have been described as "circuitous," "largely tangential," "unnecessarily convolved," "spiraling," and even irrelevant. It's obvious that Mark Richard loves the subject that he teaches, yet when this leads to abnormally high expectations for his students and gives the impression that he's more interested the philosophical complexities of language and its semantics than any concrete benefits his students might receive from his course, it can be rather trying. Although he's a very nice guy and often makes funny jokes, he seems to either (1) have been committed to making students prove their deep understanding of the material or (2) have been disconnected from the reality of his course, in which many were struggling. Unless your ability in this area is beyond that of normal, reasonably intelligent people, quizzes will not be "relatively easy to complete in an hour," as the syllabus for this course advertises. Unless you understand the nuances of the material in a shockingly comprehensive way, the final will most likely be an unpleasant experience. In sum, don't take this course unless you are interested in a GenEd of stratospheric rigor.</comment>This is a fine course, especially if you're interested in philosophy or computer science or even math. The material is pretty interesting if it's your kind of thing. It's not an 'easy' way to fulfill your EMR GenEd though. Prof. Richard is pretty terrible at teaching this class, so DO NOT take it with him unless you absolutely have to. Other professors should teach it going forward, and if they do, it should be much better.</comment>Don't take the course unless you already like formal logic. The course is very technical and the EMR requirement can be fulfilled more easily elsewhere.</comment>Take this class when someone besides Professor Richard is teaching! The p-sets are short, easy, and optional, the weekly quizzes are easy, and the curriculum is fast-paced but packs a lot in; however, Richard can easily confuse people with his explanations, especially those who don't have a logic-oriented mind. Also, if Diana is a TF, don't attend her section; she also isn't very good at explaining things.</comment>They require you to go to class, and then the professor spends half the class trying to figure out where the typo is in the powerpoint. If I had actually paid attention rather than browsed the internet, it would have been excruciating.</comment>Practice!</comment></course>HIST 1270: Frontiers of Europe: Ukraine since 1500</title>This course provides students with an excellent opportunity to develop widely applicable analytic abilities while acquainting themselves with the history of an important yet widely misunderstood part of the world.</comment>Take this class! It is not flashy or fancy—Prof. Plokhii’s quiet way of speaking may turn some off who assume the class is boring—but if you listen to what he says you will learn a ton about a country that is in the process of trying to understand its own history just as we are. While so many classes at Harvard will bring up questions of identity –national, religious, ethnic, etc. this class is a unique opportunity to learn about a fascinating struggle for identity that continues today. You must work hard to listen and do the book readings for it to pay off, but it really has the potential to in the end. I learned so much and am so grateful I took this class.</comment>There are a fair amount of graduate students who are very well versed in Ukrainian history. It's a great class, but you will have to keep up on the readings to fully understand the lectures and discussions</comment></course>ANTHRO 2626: Research Design/Proposal Writing</title>This is a must-take class - the single most valuable seminar many of us will have taken during our time at Harvard.</comment>This course definitely meets everything you expect to learn from a graduate seminar. Professors will read every single word you write and give valuable comments, corrections and suggestions to it. Strongly recommended!</comment>The class will help you shaping your dissertation project and most importantly, prepare you to submit grant proposals for the fieldwork.</comment>Do not miss an opportunity to take this class if Jean and John Comaroff are teaching it.</comment>This is one of the most helpful courses I have ever taken. Not only are the Comaroffs incredibly generous with their time but they also relate extremely well to every student's topic. Also, this course helped me tremendously to think thoroughly through my research project at an early stage, which I found very helpful and productive. No course I would recommend with more enthusiam.</comment></course>PSY 980u: Psychological Challenges of Adolescence and Early Adulthood</title>This is a really great class. Interesting subject matter, a great teacher and it has a manageable workload. Dr. Erb is very kind and I always felt relaxed and comfortable going to this class on Wednesday evenings. The course consists of weekly response papers on interesting articles which are discussed in this small seminar setting. If you put in the effort, Dr. Erb takes notes and really helps her students do well by giving us great feedback and is very transparent throughout the course about our grades and how we can improve!</comment>one of my favorite 980 classes. The teacher is very nice and straight-forward and easy to contact for help</comment>Use this opportunity to practice writing publishable papers and learn now how to format APA citations.</comment>Take this class! It's very fair in terms of workload, you will learn a lot, and the professor is the best!!!</comment>This is a really interesting psychology seminar, with a professor who really understands and cares about the material. The workload is very manageable, and the expectations are exceedingly clear, which is nice.</comment>Sarah put her heart and soul into this course. It shows.</comment>This is an extremely interesting course. You'll learn a lot about how complicated the many risk factors around adolescent and emerging adult development can be. The readings are interesting and the discussions are engaging. Easy to apply to your own life.</comment></course>FRENCH 59: French and the Community</title>This has been one of my favorite classes so far at Harvard. If given the opportunity to take a class with Carole Bergin, I would recommend it wholeheartedly.</comment>This class requires more work than you might originally expect, but if you keep up with the work, you will get a lot out of this class. Also, teaching is sooo fun!</comment>It's worth taking You're doing something for yourself by learning french but you're also helping a community. I really enjoyed that a class could integrate so well with the outside world. It immediately showed how it was applicable outside of the classroom.</comment>This class was fantastic. Carole is one of my favorite teachers at Harvard. She is so kind and dedicated. Unfortunately Carole will no longer be teaching this class. But it is a great experience either way. If you are interested in working or volunteering in Haiti, this class is a must.</comment>If this class if offered again, TAKE IT.</comment>Best course one can possibly take in learning about Haitian culture. Topics were very interesting, and assignments reinforced understanding perfectly.  The pedagogy and community service components are wonderful additions to the study.</comment>French 59 is not just another grammar and history class. Going out into the Haitian-American community and making a tangible difference not only improves language skills, but it also ingrains the importance of education.</comment>This is a great course for people who want to speak French in the context of learning about Haiti. French is used as a base for the course, which takes an all-encompassing look at education, learning French, Haitian culture, and masterpieces of Haitian literature. The course is dynamic and each class is new and interesting.</comment>this is an excellent course if you are interested in improving your speaking skills and learning vocabulary related to international development.  I did not feel that I learned too much about teaching and would have appreciated more organization and planning (including on my part) in the Saturday teaching exercises. I would also have appreciated some more clarity in the grammar handouts. Carole is a fantastic teacher and I feel lucky to have had the opportunity to take this class.</comment>Carole Bergin is leaving so I do not think it will run. Either way, she was a big part of what made it so great.</comment>This course is an amazing course to better one's French speaking ability. It's super interesting and Carole is an amazing professor.</comment>The course was thoroughly engaging and always interesting – it offered a comprehensive study of Haiti and Haitian culture through the country's literature, music, history, practices and people.</comment>Unfortunately this was the last year for this class, so no future students to tell things :( but the class was amazing!!</comment>great course</comment></course>ANTHRO 1658: Law, Culture, and Islam</title>There are so many horrible misconceptions about the Shari'ah - and about Islam - in the US (and on this campus) that courses like this should almost be a requirement. The workload is spread evenly throughout the semester and the lectures/discussion are great.</comment>This is a spectacular course for anyone interested in law, anthropology, or Islam. If you are uncomfortable in these areas, Ahmed is great at helping you out and providing a groundwork, so don't worry. This course would not be beneficial, however, if you don't have an interest in rights and the challenges that Islamic law and Muslim culture present to liberalism. If you do have this interest, this course is a must-take.</comment>If you're at all interested in Islam or Islamic law, take this class. You will love it – and you'll learn so much, too. I'm a math major – I took this just as an elective – and it was probably my favourite class this semester.</comment>It was a difficult class with a lot of reading, but the materials were interesting and Professor Ahmed was extremely knowledgeable.</comment>This is a great class to take if you don't know very much about the sharia and are looking for a solid grounding. It's also great if you want to introduce yourself to anthropology through a non-intro course.</comment></course>FRSEMR 33x: Complexity in Works of Art: Ulysses and Hamlet</title>This class is absolutely amazing, invigorating, stimulating in the best possible way. I could not commend Professor Fisher enough-- not only does he seem to know everything possible in terms of thematic arcs and intertextual connections both within Ulysses and Hamlet themselves but between the two as well, he is great at conveying the ideas to the class in a way that seems like we could have discovered them ourselves. He also gives hand-outs, both of his own making and other readings, that just give you a huge number of extremely complex but interesting ideas with which to wrestle. The readings themselves are challenging but infinitely rewarding, and the response papers (one single-spaced page a week) do well to prepare you for the longer essays, and Fisher's comments on the papers are great. Overall definitely apply to this seminar if you are interested, reading Ulysses with this class is--in my opinion-- the best way to read Ulysses.</comment>I think that it is very possible that I just took the best class that I will take at Harvard. I can't imagine a better class. Class was the best part of my week. Engulfing myself in Ulysses was probably the second best part of my week. You have the chance to learn, intimately, from one of the great luminaries at Harvard. And he is so gentle, so thoughtful, so caring about the students and the class. The class will be a lot of work--response papers every week, lots of reading, essays-- but it should be the best work that you do all semester. I couldn't recommend this class highly enough. For everyone-- not just those that are interested in the humanities. You will get the most out of it if you are willing to dive deeply into Ulysses-- but Prof. Fisher is so infectious that you can't help but do your best work for the class. Someone said on a previous recommendation that this seminar was like the Harvard experience that one dreams of having. I completely agree. Reading one of the greatest books ever with one of the greatest Professors with intelligent, passionate likeminded students. What else are you looking for? Yes.</comment>The best possible way to read Ulysses. Professor Fisher is amazing and the work, while intense, is absolutely worth it.</comment>Wonderful class, Prof. Fisher is a wonderful, wonderful speaker and teacher, but you've got to be ready to put quite a bit of time and effort in.</comment></course>RELIGION 2001: The History of the Study of Religion</title>Since this course is required of all first-year doctoral students, one cannot truly avoid taking it. However, one should do so with full awareness that the discussions are unstructured and free-wheeling (which is both a positive and a negative) and the readings are often slogs (with moments of clarity and insight).</comment></course>SCI-PHYUNV 27: Science and Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to Soft Matter Science</title>Best way to fulfill SPU gen-ed.</comment>This class is a lot of fun - the guest chefs are really cool and the labs are fun! The science is sometimes a little ambiguous and vague (esp coming from a science background) but it's an enjoyable class with not too much work</comment>The improvements they made to the class from last year really helped! It's a great course, and I felt I came out if it knowing more about physics, and I see cooking in a totally different way. If you need an SPU or just a fun fourth class, this should definitely be it.</comment>Harmless way to knock out SPU. but that says more about how bad SPU offerings are than the strength of this course. if you focus on and enjoy the cooking component, you'll like it</comment>This course is amazing, you really see food in a different way afterwards.</comment>Take for SPU. It's fun and your best option. Painless way to get this requirement out of the way if you are a humanities concentrator. At the same time, e labs and final project are actually interesting and fun, especially if you take it with friends!</comment>This class is so much fun, and if you love to cook or bake, you have to take it.</comment>This class is incredibly fun - don't be turned away by the tediousness of having to do 11 problem sets and lab worksheets every week, they are fairly simple and won't take up as much time as you think</comment>Great fun class!</comment>It is a fun class, but the lectures are pretty irrelevant.</comment>This class is a great way to learn basic chemistry concepts without too much complexity.  The psets are time consuming, but there are a lot of outside office hours to help with the difficult concepts.  Don't rely on the science section to cover all of the material - ask question in lab.  Sometimes, I feel the class oversimplified concepts for the sake of moving quickly through the material.  There is as much guidance as you seek in the course.</comment>This is a relatively easy way to fulfill SPU, but the class is not well organized and that will make it harder than it should be.</comment>This course is really fun, but also something to take seriously.</comment>Look over psets as soon as they come out, then go to office hours to ask questions. Seriously. GO TO OFFICE HOURS.</comment>This class is not like you'd think it is. First, if you are taking this class because you hate science and want to finish a GenEd quickly and painlessly, think again. This course actually goes pretty deep into science, maybe not that deep for someone into science, but as a Gov concentrator, this class was pretty painful. Also, it is highly disorganized, and is not as "fun" as described by many. The instructors were fairly distant from the class, and lectures were hard to understand sometimes. I was largely left feeling pretty disappointed by this class. That being said, it may very well be one of the least invasive science GenEds, so maybe it is for you. I would just caution anyone thinking of taking this class to not believe all of the hype.</comment>I actually learned a ton in this class, the guest chefs were amazing.  It does require you to do chemistry but in a really interesting context.  It was an interesting and painless way to get SPU out of the way.</comment>Easy. Interesting material. Good class.</comment>Good class, difficulty varies from year to year, and this year it wasn't too bad. Psets are tedious, tests are fine, and overall not too bad. The guest lectures are never tested on so you don't need to go to class on Tuesdays.</comment>It's a fun way to fulfill your SPU requirement. The guest chefs are AMAZING people. Their stories are so inspiring and sometimes they feed you. The science is not very hard, there's only one equation a week and most of the problem sets are pretty straight forward. It's not really rigorous science and sometimes the questions are kind of annoying but overall the class is not very hard and pretty fun. The exam questions can be kind of ambiguous and they are not very receptive to regrades even though they wrote a bad question.</comment>This is NOT an easy class! It's also not the easiest SPU gened, but certainly not the worst. While the class can be fairly frustrating at times, especially with difficult problem sets and unclear directions, it is pretty enjoyable and painless overall. The midterms, though, are actually fairly difficult, so be warned. But with some effort and preparation, you should both do well and enjoy it to a certain extent. Take if it you need to get your SPU gened out of the way.</comment>If you love cooking, take this course!  Be warned, though, that it does require chemistry and real science, so it does have more work than people expect.  That said, the labs were so fun, and you will become a better cook and general consumer of food for taking this class!  The guest lecturers are also extremely famous and bring great samples of their masterpieces to class.</comment>All of the science is possible if you put a little time in.  The labs are super fun and you get to eat what you have made which is great! If you get a good TF then they can be really helpful. Final projects were fine.</comment>Appreciate its unique nature!</comment>From someone who hasn't taken science in years, this course was a really fun, almost painless way to fulfill SPU. The labs are really fun for the most part and the problem sets were usually relatively straightforward. And the guest lectures were a ton of fun- if you take this, make sure you go to those.</comment>It is more work than it seems. It is a great course if you are interested in the material but other times, it can be kind of painful to sit through like guest lecturers who do not talk about science or cooking very well.</comment>This is a great class. Take it for SPU. Psets are once a week, very fair, can do with classmates. Labs are easy and fun. Exams are a little bit harder but if you study you will do well. Final project is fun just make sure to have a group you like and it will be a blast. I don't think there are any SPU that are more fun and applicable to everyday life. Take it</comment>This class is GREAT -- definitely the best SPU out there. Professor Brenner is very enthusiastic and the TF's are extremely helpful and nice. The weekly problem sets are not very intense (there are also plenty of office hours available for help if needed) and the exams are not bad either. The final project is very fun. You have tons of time to work on it in lab.</comment>You have to work hard (go to lecture, do the reading) to do well</comment>This course changed my relationship to the outside world in more profound ways than any other course I've taken at Harvard. I've had dinner with some of the world's best chefs (including the dude people call the "Mozart of Food") and been able to understand at a very deep level my favorite thing to do: eating. Some people have complaints about the course but their complaints are banal: everyone should take this course.</comment>Chef lectures are a real gem, you won't find another course like this. Brenner, Sorenson and Weitz are all very committed and fascinating teachers. And the course gives you a useful framework for thinking about food.</comment>This an interesting class to take for GenEd credit. The chefs are great! Pick final project that is interesting to you because you spend a lot of time working on it</comment>This is probably one of the best of your SPU options. Take it! You learn some cool stuff, hear chef lectures, and cook some food.</comment>This class is awesome. For an SPU the material and workload was fair and bearable. Plus, the teaching staff is so enthusiastic and helpful, they made the class even better.</comment>Really interesting and fun class with not a lot of work.  Really easy if  you have a strong science background.</comment>great way to get the spu requirement out of the way. Who doesn't like food and enjoy hearing from world renowned chefs. The class so so much more engaging than the other spu's I saw and even won lotteries for, so I had to take it.</comment>The course is not difficult in terms of the science, but it ends up being very time consuming (especially the final project--make sure to get a good partner).</comment>This is a cool, interesting, and easy class that I would recommend especially for the awesome lineup of guest lecturers. If you're just looking for a class without much work, though, I might suggest looking elsewhere. This class kind of nags with busy work in a way you might not expect from a Gen Ed - there are weekly p-sets, 2 midterms, and a final project with weekly check ins, a lab notebook, a final paper, a powerpoint, and a video. The teaching staff is really nice, the exams aren't difficult, and the grading is lenient, but there are definitely classes with less work that will allow you to satisfy your Gen Ed requirement.</comment>Despite the various gaps that were left from the course being restructured many times, the class does a good job of helping you better understand the role of science in everyday life things like cooking. The guest chefs were phenomenal, and I loved getting a better grasp of cooking from a different perspective. The course staff were all incredibly supportive and enthusiastic.</comment>The teaching staff is unbelievably enthusiastic and labs are fun. However, this is on the heavy side of work for an SPU: weekly psets and labs, 2 midterms, and a final project.</comment>Good class. They're improving it. I would recommend it, but it is a bit more work than your typical gen ed.</comment>Don't take this class just because you think it's going to be a breeze. Also, go to all the lectures involving guest speakers, as half the time, you get free food and they're really cool.</comment>SO MUCH FUN! GO TO CLASS TO GET THE FOOD</comment>I did it. I did it after barely learning any chem in high school. You should do it too. There is plenty of TFs to go around, and the course heads are really accessible, so if you're ever worried about a p-set, you have someone to go to. For someone who often says the broad statement "I don't understand/like science" this course really made me engage in something I'm passionate about (i.e. food) in a new way. One of the best gen eds to take at Harvard. That being said, not a course you can just float along in for the entire semester. You should go to the chef demos (there's always food) but all the lectures are recorded. In the end, even if you don't like going to lecture, there is a TON of course materials on the website to help you along. But..the course is so much better in person.</comment>Don't overthink the problem sets, the TFs aren't trying to throw curveballs at you. Do overthink the final project; it's a great opportunity to create something new and interesting with the help of the cooking lab's resources. Going to every lecture is a rewarding experience, and sometimes the reward is food!</comment>This is a very reasonable Gen-Ed class. The problems on the psets are based on the material covered in lecture, so there are no surprises. Some chefs are better lecturers than others, but they are a great element to the class. Some bring food, which is always a plus. Labs are easy to follow.</comment>This is an interesting course, but it does take up a lot of time outside of class. I am a Senior humanities concentrator who hasn't taken science since high school, and that made it hard. The Psets take a long time if you aren't used to doing them. In the end I liked this course fine and I think I'll get a solid grade even though I'm not good at science, but I don't feel like I learned anything that important and I spent so much time working on tedious assignments.</comment>This course is not difficult at all and is one of the coolest courses I've taken at Harvard. The really cool thing about this class is that absolutely everyone is super excited about food (students included). Guest chef lectures are amazing, and I always left class feeling like I learned something new. There is literally no way you can go wrong with this course. At times, the course may seem frustrating because it can be a little bit disorganized, but beyond that, take it. You won't regret it.</comment>Wait until it is organized better. Cool idea for a class but not implemented well.</comment>Don't go in expecting an easy GenEd, because there is legit work involved. But if you go in knowing there will be work, then you would be fine and as GenEds go, it's a fun one, despite the work.</comment>It's amazing how much you learn about food you eat from a totally different perspective. Take this course!!</comment>Science of Cooking is not a joke.  The Psets take a long time and the first midterm was a bit challenging.  That said, it forced me to really engage in the material and for that I am grateful.  There is plenty of support, the teaching staff is great, and lab is super fun!  Definitely not upset I took it--it also restored my confidence in the sciences, which is nice.</comment>I loved the class for the lectures, guest speakers, and cooking/demo components, but the problem sets and lab work itself can be very time consuming. For a Gen Ed course, it probably takes more time than you'd expect, but as someone who loves food and cooking -- it's very fulfilling and interesting. You'll definitely walk away applying these concepts to your daily life and thinking (which is what a Gen Ed aims for).</comment>A great class to fill the SPU requirement. The workload is constant but not necessarily very difficult. Toward the end the final project can eat up a lot of time because it requires a poster, writeup, and video presentation.</comment>It's a great class to fulfill SPU.</comment>This class is great! A fun way to fulfill your SPU gen ed--you get to talk about and eat food with some of the most famous chefs in the world!</comment>If you are at all afraid of the hard sciences at Harvard, take this course. It allows you to get your feet wet in the material without feeling like you are being thrown into the deep end.</comment>This class is a great senior semester class---it's low-stress and really easy (content-wise and workload-wise), you get to make/eat food, and somehow you still manage to learn a fair amount of chemistry (assuming you're not already a biology/chemistry concentrator). Kind of wish there were more classes like this, since it's rare to have an easy class that you feel like you actually take something away from.</comment>An awesome way to fulfill the SPU requirement! The professors and TFs are wonderful, and you get to eat your experiments. Can't think of a better class than this!</comment>If you enjoy cooking, and know some science, this course will be fun</comment>The course was a lot of tedious, and mostly uninteresting work. Psets are long with repetitive and annoying questions. And the final project consisted of a report AND a poster AND a fair AND a lab notebook AND a video... They'll try to keep you busy, and the large amount of time you spend on this course doesn't translate into a lot of gained knowledge.</comment>Science and Cooking is a relatively painless way to fulfill this requirement. The material is interesting and the guest lectures are usually really good. You won't learn a whole lot about everyday cooking, but you will be introduced to the really interesting world of modernist cuisine.</comment>It's not necessarily a very easy class. You have to put in work (with problem sets, lab and final projects). It does take some time out of your schedule, but for people familiar with the sciences the class isn't difficult (just tedious). It's also fun regardless of your background. I do think that people without any science background may have struggled because the science/physics concepts they cover are somewhat disjointed, but they only briefly touch on these topics without getting too in depth, so I think it's still a good class for people with little to no background in science. Definitely could have been more organized in terms of lab and lectures, but the guest chefs were amazing and I think this class is very unique and worth taking. The extra time put into some of the work is not too bad, especially seeing as there is no final!</comment>This class is a bit rough for a gen ed, to be honest. As a senior who has completed all of the areas, this one was unnecessarily harsh in terms of the length of the problem sets, but the midterms weren't particularly difficult. That being said, there is a lot of information presented, so sometimes it is difficult to sift through it all if you are busy in other areas. All in all, this class was more intense than I wanted it to be (in terms of time commitment, not difficulty), but it wasn't too too painful for a non-science science gen ed.</comment>Science and Cooking is really great-- they changed a lot of things from last year after getting a lot of negative feedback, and I really enjoyed the class this year. It's more work that I initially expected (weekly problem set and labs, 2 midterms, and a final project) but I don't think it's worse than other SPUs in terms of assignments. Content and difficulty-wise, it trumps all other SPUs. There are lots of supplementary reading materials and videos that you can use to study for the exams, as well as all previous exams that are uploaded on the website once the exams draw near. I'm really glad that I took this course!</comment>The class was interesting. I found Professor Brenner really helpful and accessible outside of class. But the problem sets were annoying. Not difficult, but annoying.</comment>This class is incredibly fun and often delicious. Prepare to spend time on the psets, but do not be intimidated by the science. The course is designed to help you!</comment>Make sure you find a group to do problem sets with. Its fine doing them alone but you can be much more effective with time and understand the material better with a group.</comment>The class is cool, and as far as SPU gen eds go, this one's pretty good. The chef lectures are all really interesting, and although some of the math feels contrived, this is a relatively painless way to fulfill SPU.</comment>Take this class because it is fun but the p-sets are very time consuming and for me hard to do without the help of a TF. Watch all the videos because if you don't you will get lost in the course. The Thursday lectures are not really necessary to go to even though I went to almost every one. Labs are long and you may have to stay extra, but the tuesday lectures with the world renewed chefs make the course with it!</comment>Science and Cooking is fun, ridiculously easy, and will teach you basic concepts about cooking you’d wish you’d known for years.</comment>If you love food, want to hang with the world's greatest chefs, make food, be creative, and have fun, take this class.</comment>Take this course if you are even sort of interested by food (which you should be on some level if you are a human) and also need to fulfill this requirement. Note "and" vs "or".</comment>This class is a very interesting but tedious one. The content of the course is life changing but the way it is presented often kills its sexiness. Don't take this class unless you are willing to put the time into fairly demanding weekly tasks.</comment>This class is the perfect fusion between things people love, with material presented in an incredibly creative and engaging way, and interesting psets that are actually fun.</comment>This class seems pretty cool in theory, but it really isn't once you've taken it for a month. That's when you realize that lectures are actually pretty boring and sometimes the guest lecturers, although they do sometimes give out food, are not that great presenters. Labs are not very well food-integrated. We watched cheese slide down tubes and waited for pasta to boil--that's not really considered cooking. But it's not a hard class and sometimes you get to eat food, which is nice.</comment>You will have labs, get over it. The labs are fun and you get to eat stuff. You will do math, but they give you the equations for every test. The mathiest thing you do is multiplication with a calculator, and if you can't do that you need to rethink your time here.</comment>Great option for an SPU - it wasn't as hard or finnicky this semester as it had been in the past. Painless, pretty simple, and you get to eat in lab.</comment>This class is interesting if you are interested in cooking -- I especially recommend going to the guest lectures! However, labs and problem sets can be unclear/tedious, so just be aware that the class may take up more time than you anticipate.</comment></course>ENG-SCI 274: Quantum Devices</title>You learn as much as you put it. Professor is a very intellect one, give you physics pictures instead of math equations.</comment></course>EXPOS 20.135: The Body in Art: From Ideal to Real</title>I will only recommend you to take this course if you are strongly interested in nudity art and prepare to have the most demanding workload you could ever imagine. As an expos class, Body and Art is unfit for its job. It extensively emphasizes on the art component of the class while largely neglects the true purpose of the class. Although the preceptor has expertise in art and fashion, her explanation and insight are often too abstruse to understand without a fair art background. I can I spent 80% of my harvard career on this expos. Reconsider twice before you take this course. Make sure you are both mentally and physically prepare for this highly art specialized and heavy workload class.</comment>It is a LOT of work. Professor De Young has super high expectations for your writing, which is not a bad thing. You learn a lot, but it is stressful.</comment>A lot of nudity.</comment>No art background is necessary for this class! As a chemistry concentrator, I found this course compelling, fun and definitely worth taking. The readings are interesting, the professor is helpful and bright, and I learned to appreciate and enjoy art. This course helped me grow as a writer and boosted my confidence in my writing. There are a lot of fun field trips to museums I would have otherwise not taken advantage of. As an expos class, it is the best I could have imagined taking, especially hearing my friends complain about theirs.</comment>The course is very art-specific and fairly intensive. Do not take this class unless you have a thorough interest in writing about and analyzing art.</comment>This course is challenging like most Expository classes are, but I found it to be very interesting and engaging. We were able to go on museum visits and see art first hand, as well as learn how to view and analyze art more generally. I learned a great deal about how to write about a piece of artwork and how to do research at Harvard, both in the online databases and in the library. I also learned how to engage with scholars as well as my own ideas and come to an arguable and original thesis. I have come out of this course with a deeper appreciation for art more generally and I now want to take more art history over the next few years.</comment>This is an interesting, fascinating topic that Prof. De Young teaches exceptionally. Her readings and resources are excellent. However, the course seems significantly more rigorous than other expos, so I would not recommend it to someone not particularly interested in art history or looking for an "easy" expos (if that exists).</comment>You may not be interested in art, but this class will definitely make you. Partly because it covers topics such as nudity and nineteenth- to twentieth- century what-could-be-described-as-pornographic art, which in my opinion should naturally draw anyone's attention–at least a little bit. And partly because after observing many and many pieces of artwork, you'll learn to appreciate critiquing and throwing in your two cents about what is achieved or how great/bad, beautiful/ugly, pleasing/discomforting they are.</comment>It can seem very difficult at times, but you do emerge as a better, more incisive writer at the end. A lot of people will bemoan their letter grades; you can take that into account when deciding whether to take this course, but also know that that's why you have so many resources: the Writing Center is super helpful!! Also make better use of Professor de Young's office hours than I did (They're probably more interesting than your LS1a TF's but shhh)</comment>This is an incredible class that provides the essentials needed for college-level writing. I am an engineering concentrator and I figured this class sounded interesting, and it completely was! Even if it is something you do not want to concentrate in, if it sounds interesting to you, take it! However, I will warn you that this class is pretty tough in comparison to the other expos classes. The subject itself was pretty new to most of us, which in turn made the writing more difficult. Also Prof. De Young is not one to fill you with compliments at all stages during the writing compliments (even if you think it's what you deserve). She is a tough preceptor in that she always has something for you to improve upon.</comment>This is a very interesting class, especially if you are passionate about feminism, gender roles, or the sociology of nudity. It was insightful and pushed me to be creative and open-minded, which is an important lesson to be learned in college. The readings don't take that long and you can skim them often, but they're also usually pretty interesting and participating in discussion in class was always really fun. I felt like my ideas all mattered and that I was gaining something from the experience. I definitely considered taking more classes like this.</comment></course>EXPOS 20.233: Who Owns the Past?</title>Everyone looks at Expos and is afraid. This may be the one expos section you DO NOT need to be afraid of! Great feedback, great preceptor, and light workload!</comment>Based on my talks with kids in other Expos classes, this one was fairly easy while at the same time interesting.</comment>It's an expos class, so there's definitely a limit to how much one can engage with the subject matter. Janling either only brings a superficial knowledge of archaeology to the class or really only has a superficial knowledge of archaeology, but since it's more of a methods class than an archaeology class this isn't too important, just keep this in mind when you set up expectations for this course.</comment>It's interesting, but if you're not really interested in archaeology it might be boring at times.</comment>Take this class if you have existing interests in ancient history or museum studies. It takes more of a "science and society" approach to archaeology, so be prepared to read and discuss social theory. Janling's feedback is usually detailed and helpful. Most of what I'm taking away from Expos with regard to my own writing will be from his written comments and the one-on-one draft conferences.</comment>To take this class you definitely must have some interest in archeology or anthropology. The readings are centered around this. I found the reading enjoyable because I was invested in the topic.</comment>This course is very interesting, even if you do not have any interest at all in archaeology.  Janling is a fantastic preceptor.  We engaged in a lot of discussion in class and learned a few social theories that I really enjoyed pondering.  That being said, I think it is hard to do extremely well in this course because for writing to receive an A, it must be very good.</comment>The readings were generally short and this course does not take much out of your schedule, take if if you like the topic!</comment>Make sure you're interested in archeology going in. Preceptor Fu gives a lot of good feedback, but you might get bored with some of the longer pieces of writing, particularly Said's Orientalism. Make sure you manage your time effectively so that you aren't rushing to submit at the last minute.</comment>Janling is a great preceptor who offers constructive feedback on papers and makes the class interesting with humorous anecdotes from the field.</comment>This course is suited for those that are already interested in the topic. I was originally taking this class to try and broaden my horizons but i feel like the specificity of the course was not what i expected. There were 3 specific instances that we examined instead of the theory of "who owns the past?" in a broader sense. If you are interested in the topics listed in the cyllabus janling does a great job of teaching and gives very helpful feedback and is available upon request.</comment></course>PERSIAN Ba: Intermediate Persian I</title>The Persian program at Harvard seems to remain in a state of flux, and until it is made a priority within the administration, cannot be recommended wholeheartedly. The faculty I have had are earnest, enthusiastic, and dedicated to the language and its instruction, but the youth of the instructors, the variation between instructors, and the lack of a sense of support from department admins (or higher) makes Persian a frustrating language track.</comment>Only take this class if you are really passionate about Persian or have a strong reason for taking it. The class will help you read and write better but not improve your speaking skills too much.</comment>This is a very difficult course, but the language is fascinating and worth studying</comment>It is literally your only option if you want to carry on learning Persian.</comment>I loved this class. The professor is awesome, but he is leaving next year. That being said, Persian is a beautiful language, so definitely go for it</comment>It is not a very holistic approach to the language. If someone is interested in being able to read scholarly texts in Persian, then it would probably suit their goals better than someone who wanted to be able to speak the language and have daily interactions.</comment></course>BCMP 218: Molecular Medicine</title>Take this class if you are interested in meeting leaders in biomedical research in the HMS community.</comment>Really awesome class that surveys a wide range of fascinating topics relevant to the modern, aspiring physician-scientist.</comment>This class provides you the views on different research topics and the task on this course is not heavy.</comment>Really interesing, casual environment that facilitates discussion</comment>This is a fantastic seminar course - it is very well-run and thoughtfully organised. It is a great course to take in the first year of your PhD, as it provides a good survey/introduction to numerous pertinent topics in molecular medicine, from immunology, to genetics, to developmental biology and beyond. There is a good mix of basic science and clinical / therapeutic / technological / genomics applications of fundamental research covered in the course.  Every week features a different lecturer - a leading researcher in her/his respective field. You have the chance to listen to an hour's lecture of their work and fundamental developments in their field of research, and this is followed by two student presentations on the featured papers. There is the potential for lively discussions and for engagement with the lecturers. The student presenters also have an opportunity to interact with their respective faculty lecturers during a pre-class meeting, which is a great way of learning about the science, and the stories, in a small-group context. Feedback is given regarding your presentations.  I would highly recommend this class to anyone interested in learning more broadly about the basic molecular biology underpinning modern medicine, therapeutics and technologies, and to people interested in translational research.</comment></course>PSY 14: Cognitive Neuroscience</title>Overall, it is a very doable class. It is hard to follow along in lecture because at times it is a little boring. The professors do care about the material they are teaching.</comment>I really enjoyed this class. Both Professor Schacter and Professor Alvarez are great. They are really passionate about the material they teach in class, and they really want to get to know the students. However, you really need to have an interest in cognitive neuroscience to enjoy the course. It is more difficult than other foundational classes.</comment>Only take this class if you really have to for a concentration requirement. It was really interesting to learn about the brain and how it functions, but lectures were boring at times and unfortunately you have to show up because there are in class quizzes.</comment>Great professors and great class! Not as difficult and scary as people say.</comment>I decided to take this class over MCB 80, and after speaking with friends who did otherwise, I'm very happy with my decision. The class is long, but it also goes over some very interesting topics and experiments that shape the way we think about the mind. I didn't find midterms to be very bad and as long as you studied and went over lectures, you should do fine. There isn't a lot of work except for the final paper, which is not even too hard because you get to do a rough draft first. Katie is an amazing TF and I found her sections most helpful. This semester sections were optional--but I would go to every single one because they're a good review.</comment>A good psych course. Spends a lot of time on memory and vision (which are the professor's specialities) so if you're interested in those, take this course. Everything else is not gone into in depth. Don't be afraid of the in-class quizzes - they're easy 100s with joke answers like "Shia Labeouf"</comment>I think this class is awesome, and really helped me to understand my other psychology courses better.</comment>This course was better than I thought it would be. It didn't have the best Q score compared to other psychology classes so I was a little worried. Katie Porter is a great TF and a really nice, genuine person. I liked how the professors alternated with lecturing; they each taught on subjects they knew/did research in. Exams were focused on these components of class, in this order: Lecture and related journal articles assigned, section, and the book. The book wasn't really necessary - there were maybe one or two questions per exam that tested material exclusively in the book. I wouldn't waste my money again buying it if I really knew. This is a great option for the introductory psych course requirement!! I chose to do abnormal last spring as my other intro class. I liked the abnormal content better (my favorite area of psych) but the cognitive neuroscience course a lot better.</comment>I really enjoyed this class! If you're not interested in the cognitive neuroscience aspect of psychology then I would advise you not to take this course that is conveniently titled cognitive neuroscience, but I am interested in the topic, and the professors did not fail to provide a showcase for many different aspects in the field! Obviously it's still a foundational course, so you don't go incredibly in depth on all of the topics, but it gets sufficiently deep, and I'm very pleased with the course overall!</comment>This is a very good course if you would like to become better acquainted with current advances in the field of neuroscience. Occasionally, the relationship between lectures and other course materials can be confusing.</comment>This course covers a lot of interesting material that is at the intersection of psychology and neuroscience. If you're interested in learning more about the brain without getting bogged down in details about chemical names/processes, this is a really good class to take. I am not a psych or bio concentrator and I found the material engaging, although I would give a heads up that lectures can sometimes be slow.</comment>A lot of work for preparation</comment>Lectures can be a little dry, but the material is very interesting</comment>It's a class that involves very little homework yet somehow manages to make you very, very familiar with an entire scientific field. What more could you ask for?</comment>This class was disappointing. For such a new and exciting field (cognitive neuroscience) this class was able to suck the new and exciting appeal out of it with dry and often unclear lectures. The focus on memory and vision and the level of detail presented on these subjects was ridiculous in comparison to what information we were held accountable for on the other subjects, resulting in an unrepresentative knowledge base of neuroscience.</comment>It is amazing!! The professors are both super knowledgeable and the information is really interesting. I highly recommend this class. I also learned a lot through the paper I wrote for this class.</comment></course>APPHY 50a: Physics as a Foundation for Science and Engineering, Part I</title>Great class, the best part is learning to be a productive member of a team and have fun creating practical physics projects.</comment>I think that this is a good class for kids not very interesting in physics but either need to take a physics class or enjoy working on projects. I think for students actually interested in physics, the 12 or 15 tracks might be better.</comment>Take this course it is unlike any other course you will take. You will enjoy learning and growing in your physics understanding.</comment>This is the best way to complete the physics requirement with one caveat: if you really like physics or really want to know great deal of physics, this is not the class.</comment>I would tell them that it is a great course to take if they are very self-starting learners.</comment>You need to be willing to work</comment>This is the best physics alternative if you want a fun class where you learn a good amount and is very easy grade-wise. Don't take it if you don't like working with teams or if you can't learn on your own.</comment>You'll learn a lot in this class as long as you're willing to put in the effort!</comment>It's definitely better than learning physics in a lecture based way, but it's still a physics class.</comment>It is a great course to broaden your physical knowledge and also to develop your teamwork skills.</comment>Take it. It is much better than any alternative to fulfill recs you have and it is such a supportive environment. You'll have to self teach a bit, but you will learn. you will also have the satisfaction of building things with your bare hands and being proud of yourself.</comment>To be honest, this class has a great concept and I was really enamored with the philosophy behind it - that we could actually learn physics through actual physics projects. However, the execution wasn't the best. The readings were not helpful, and we didn't really learn much in class. I would shop the other options, but it's likely that AP50 is the best option for pre-meds trying to fulfill the physics requirement.</comment>AP50a was an absolute joy. The teaching staff is fantastic and really makes this class more than just than a course, but an actual pleasant and enjoyable learning experience. The work is quite manageable, though some weeks are busier than others (there were some weeks that you had two reading assignments and the project proposal and contract due, and then a p-set due the following week; whereas other weeks, there were no assignments) so you do need to plan ahead (but this info is clearly detailed in the course syllabus-- including what activities we'll do in class for the semester). In addition, some of the work can be a little complex and not having lectures means that you need to do the learning by yourself. This is where office hours (and there were so many of them!) will come in handy but it's certainly the kind of thing that you will get out of it what you put into it. It really is worth putting in the time and if you do take this course, you should really strive to put in your full efforts!</comment>Most painless way to kill the physics requirement if you're premed but don't expect to have much real knowledge of physics afterward, unless you work extra hard. I recommend that you start assignments early and seek out extra help/resources if you want to really learn. The projects were pretty fun. Kelly is super helpful. The TFs were pretty hit or miss, find a TF that is really helpful and cling to them, even if they aren't assigned to you.</comment>Don't take this if you don't want to spend a lot of time working on group projects outside of class.</comment>Definitely take this course if you want to try working in teams and physically building tangible things. In terms of learning physics, not everything will stick (so if you're premed, maybe this isn't the course for you) but if you're interested in learning real world applications of physics.</comment>This is a great class if you are okay with working in groups! By far best way to fulfill physics requirement.</comment>great class take it</comment>Easiest perhaps most enriching way to get that physics credit</comment>This is a fantastic, hands on, project and team based course that is an easy time for both science concentrators and gen ed seekers alike. The course work is not difficult, but you learn a wide range of things, and traditional learning is thrown out the window. You really take control of what you learn, spend more time on doing than passive learning, and there are no lectures or section.</comment>The project-based teamwork component is the best part of this class and should honestly be a more common feature across all college courses. You get to learn a lot about yourself and working in a team. The 3 hour classes where you just work through problems at a glacial pace can be frustrating. But feeling like you walk away with very little new knowledge is rather disappointing, even if you got an A. This class is too easy to be good.</comment>This is a different alternative to Physics 12 or 15. Students need to be self-motivated in order to succeed, and working as a team is essential to doing well. The projects are interesting but require substantial outside of class work, but for people who prefer hands-on learning or want to get into a design shop, this class is awesome.</comment>This class was great. However, the material is difficult and even though I put in a lot of effort, I don't believe that I really learned much of the material, or could apply it outside of this class.</comment>Keep up with the readings. Find a method and stick to it.</comment>If you're reading this post trying to decide between PS2 or AP50a I'll break it down for you real quick. If you are a "physic/engineering" person take PS2. You will not get the foundational physics you need in AP50a in order to excel in upper level physic/engineering classes. If you are pre-med trying to get a good mark... take AP50a. It's honestly an enjoyable class. You will learn a bit about physics if you choose to and you will work on three cool projects. No exams. Problem Sets are graded on effort. Profs and TFs are really nice and cool. But you will not come away with the same physics foundation at PS2.</comment>This course has a good heart, but is incredibly disorganized. I would wait a few years for the course to cement itself more before taking it.</comment>A great way to fill the Physics requirement if you don't want to get deep into the math behind it.</comment>It's great to take if you aren't sure how strong you are with physics and is a nice alternative to the other introductory physics courses. That being said, the course is sometimes hard to manage when they have multiple components (quizzes, psets, group projects) with close deadlines, and some of the organizational issues can be frustrating. It's hard to tell how well you're doing in the course, and it's a lot of independent learning/work to grasp physics concepts.</comment>If you enjoy following orders or else being marked off because of it this is your course.  Yes you get to design projects, but that is such a small and easy part of the course that it does not dominate my view of this course.  Perhaps if there was an actual structure to the grading in this course rather than an arbitrary grading that you don't know what you will get on anything until it is returned this course would be more enjoyable.</comment>This class is a fun way to explore physics concepts through projects designed to apply these physics concepts to real-world situations.</comment>If you are looking for an easy way to learn physics as a premed, take this class!! The projects and assignments can seem dumb at times, but if you do the work you will for sure get an A. Like I would be pissed if I got even an A- in this class. Honestly, I feel like I'm learning enough physics for the MCAT which is all I'll ever need physics for anyways so I don't really care that I'm not learning more advanced shit. Also you will not ever do hard math so don't worry about that.</comment>Don't take this class if you really want to learn physics. The fact of the matter is that when you have three other classes that demand a lot from you, you aren't going to put the effort into this class. It's also so unorganized, which is frustrating.</comment>If you put effort in on the readings and problem sets, it is not a difficult class.</comment>This class is horrendous. 

It focuses on the development of new teaching methods ('flipped classroom', 'online learning', 'applications focus'), under the assumption that they will be better and help students learn. The reality is that the new methods are ineffective and frustrating for us. The technology solves no problems, and instead creates new issues.

Meanwhile, Eric Mazur uses his students as guinea pigs in a flawed experiment, and you even feel like you are being watched as observers frequent the classroom. He collects data that makes his methods look good and seems unwilling to adapt the dysfunctional pieces of his course. 

As for the course's content, understand that this course will not teach you physics. It will not even kind-of teach you physics. This is a remedial course for people who didn't do any kind of science in high school. There is no math. The textbook is atrocious, but the primary way you're supposed to learn in the course.The reality is that the one student in your group who took AP physics in high school will save your entire group, and the rest of students will leave the course as clueless as they came. 

And work? Well, that is the one redeeming thing about this course. You cannot fail to get an A. The work is extremely light, and doing it in groups guarantees that you never dip below an acceptable standard. A non-standard (3, 2, 1, where 2 is an A) grading system inflates your grade substantially. As a result, this class is filled with premeds.

If you care about learning physics, dislike group work, or hate premeds, do not take this course. In any other case, this class is harmless but a tremendous waste of money. 

Eric Mazur should not be hailed for his teaching methods. They are a sham.</comment>The positives are: no final or exams, easy to get a good grade
The negatives are: you probably won't learn a lot of physics, group projects can be brutal
If you're the type of person who likes group projects and doesn't get stressed about getting thing done last minute, this is a good class for you. If you are a typical pre-med (like me) you will find this class frustrating.</comment>If you want a good grade and you're willing to put up with a LOT of annoying group work, you should do it. It's worth it if you put in the effort, but it's a huge pain if you go into it thinking it will be easy or that you can do it on your own. You have to really buy in to what the instructors believe to have a good time.</comment>This class will get the requirement out of the way in a relatively fun way but you have to be incredibly driven to learn from the class.</comment>When it comes down to it, if you are pre-med and have zero physics background, like I do, then you have two choices: PS 2 or AP50a. When narrowed down like this, the answer is pretty simple: AP50a. While the amount of time you will have to commit to this class can be downright daunting at times (~4 hours a week reading, many hours on psets, and group work), the grading system makes it all worth it because you are graded on effort and not accuracy. This takes the pressure WAY off and allows you to sit back and learn something for a change, which is nice. That being said, prepare for some tedious amount of reading and annotations, annoying teammates, and confused TFs. My best piece of advice for this class would be to just keep moving forward and not fall behind on reading annotations, be present during pset and RAAs (the closest thing to an exam in this class), and pray during the Expos that you don't look like an idiot.</comment>This course can be difficult to schedule due to all of the group-based aspects. Regardless, it was such a great, low-stress, and straight-forward way to learn physics!</comment>NO EXAMS NO EXAMS NO EXAMS. If you're like me and hate the usual memorization/regurgitation based learning that goes on in science, this is the class for you. It's far more focused on actual learning and application than useless facts. <3 I LOVE THIS COURSE</comment>very different class structure, but extremely enjoyable, and a greater emphasis on learning</comment></course>SPANSH 50: Writing and Performance</title>This class will be the most frustrating that you will take at Harvard. There is truly no syllabus, and all of the section leader options are unfriendly and unnecessarily harsh.</comment>This course is a wonderful way to expand your Spanish speaking ability in a performance setting. It challenges you to think and talk on your feet.</comment>A good course that really works to improve your all-around Spanish skills. You also get to study more culture than in previous classes, but make sure you know your grammar forms-teaching of grammar is not emphasized very much in the class. There's a lot of compositions, but they aren't difficult to write, and they should not be discouraging if you're on the fence about taking the class.</comment>Antonio is a great TF, but at times this class felt like a disappointment. This stemmed from the syllabus which often wasn't cohesive. I felt like at times there was an overwhelming amount of work for this class (especially since it is often taken as an elective or as a less time intensive class). Other times there was little to no work. I wish we read more interesting works, but I think that is just what comes with the territory of this being a theatre and performance class. The acting aspect was kind of annoying (obviously cannot be avoided), but the last class where we performed scenes straight out of the play really seemed useless. Once again, this is the fault of whoever designed the syllabus. The composition ideas were really strange too. Check the syllabus next year and look through it carefully. Try to get Antonio as your Tf, he is super helpful.</comment>The exams for this class are pretty chill, they're all just performance based so not a lot of studying is required. Definitely stay caught up on the reading though and be able to speak about them in section.</comment>After taking a year off Spanish, this class was a good refresher, but I don't think my speaking or writing improved very much. We got to read and discuss some pretty cool literature, and it was relatively low-stress, though the group performance projects could be annoying to coordinate.</comment>Spanish 50 requires a lot of work, but your growth as a Spanish speaker is proportional. The readings are interesting as are the discussions that take place in class every day. All of the exams are group projects, which can be frustrating for scheduling purposes, but can also be rewarding as you get to know your classmates well. All in all, this class is difficult but worthwhile.</comment>The readings are more intense than I had originally thought, but the tests are great. They pair creative writing with performance and expression. The essay assignments were open for a lot of creative interpretation, and they helped to think farther about the themes of the course.</comment>Don't take it with thenensoya.</comment>This is a great Spanish class that gives you a lot of speaking and writing practice. It is significantly more work than Spanish 40, as there are many more writing assignments and multiple group projects, but none of the assignments are unmanageable. Sometimes there were not fully clear explanations of deadlines and expectations, but overall Carlos was a great TF and the course improved my Spanish and helped alleviate my anxiety over performing in front of a class.</comment>this course was extremely frustrating because the assignments were very unclear and we repeatedly were assigned huge assignments due a day or two later. I also hated the lack of a syllabus after the first two weeks of the class. the TF could also be very condescending and graded incomparably harder than the TFs in spanish 40. I think my spanish actually got worse during this class...</comment>I would tell future students that this course allows them to gain knowledge about the broad genre of Spanish literature and works of theater, but that it does so by selecting largely engaging and interesting texts.</comment>Spanish 50 is a fun opportunity to perfect your acting and presentation abilities while pursuing advanced Spanish studies. With that said, this is a difficult class and a definite step up from Spanish 40.</comment>Take Spanish 40 or 59. You will get more out of those classes.</comment>This course is undoubtedly a lot of work, but your Spanish will improve tremendously! Moreover, because of the small-class size and the group nature of the tests, you become great friends with all of your classmates, which makes the class socially very rewarding. And, speaking of the group tests, though time consuming, they may be among the most fun tests you will take at Harvard and also help improve the very valuable skills of working in a group!</comment>A painless class and can actually be fun at times. Definitely take it with Luis if you can - he's the best.</comment>This class is fun and not too difficult. If you do the essays and participate in class, you will get along just fine. Antonio is awesome as well!!</comment>This class is so enjoyable and fun, but it also teaches you a lot about spanish literature, culture, and history, and your spanish will improve if you put in the effort!</comment>Not a whole lot different from Spanish 40 do it for a citation</comment>Great class. You get to be creative.</comment>Be prepared for a lot of busy work.</comment>This class was disorganized and somewhat difficult to navigate, as the website and syllabus could be difficult to navigate. It seemed like some assignments (especially group projects) were sprung on us without warning, which could be difficult. The material covered -- especially the two plays we read -- were very interesting, as were the in-class discussions. Overall, my spoken Spanish improved, but not without the frustration of the course organization.</comment>This course is challenging but rewarding. You speak exclusively in Spanish for the entirety of the class. It initially feels like a big jump from Spanish 40 and we don't do any grammar review but it is useful to get to practice a lot of speaking. The "exams" are a little bit weird (they're just acting) but they're interesting and typically not too difficult. This class really felt like a class that was in Spanish rather than a class on Spanish which is good if you feel like you are at a level of speaking/writing/understanding where you can do that.</comment>Don't take this class if you're not interested in literature. Although I adored my section and TF, sometimes I felt like my Spanish wasn't improving as much as I wanted to and that was a bit disappointing. I think that if you want to improve your Spanish speaking skills in the context of academia, I would definitely recommend this class. Otherwise, take 59.</comment>Great, fun course that you will really enjoy taking if you are willing to put in the time and go all out for the performances and the work. The compositions are frequent and rather difficult, but I found Luis to be very open to meeting with me, and we improved tremendously throughout the semester. Definitely worth taking.</comment>It will probably feel overwhelming at first, especially if it's your first college-level language course, but once you get used to it, you'll feel really proud of all the things you can understand and how much better you can speak.</comment>a lot of fun</comment>This was a really fun class and my conversation skills improved a lot! If possible, try to get in a smaller section. I feel that the small class size really enhanced my experience.</comment>You are expected to act in this class.  The assignments are creative but are often busy work.</comment>If you love spanish but are not particularly fond of literature analysis, do not take this course.</comment>The class was certainly difficult with a large number of written assignments. However, the course material was fascinating. Take the course if you are interested in more modern Spanish literature and only if you are comfortable performing in front of your classmates.</comment>If you are willing to put it in the time to attend section and engage the material, this class will go by great. It's critical to stay on top of the work—the deadlines and exact specifications of each assignment can be difficult to understand, and if you fall behind the amount of work can be difficult to overcome.</comment>It's a pretty easy class workload-wise, just reading works in Spanish and the several midterms. The midterms are kind of annoying, but not difficult.</comment>There is a big jump between the skill expected of you in Spanish 40 versus Spanish 50. It is very necessary to practice all the time and stay on top of material. The assignments are good and not difficult on their own but there are many.</comment>This class is a whole lot of fun if you have the right TF. Take some time during shopping period to feel out which one is best for you.</comment>I absolutely loved Spanish 50.  The works we read were interesting, the discussions we had about them were deep and thought provoking, and I enjoyed speaking and improving my Spanish oral skills through the "exams" (which were presentations in front of the class).  The essays were easy to do, and since our section was small, we got to really make connections between each other and our TF.  This was a great step up from Spanish 40.  I think the only thing I didn't love was the over abundance of short stories we were reading in the middle of the class.  I think it would've been more interesting to read another play or work and spend a longer time on that then burning through one short story a day.</comment>Obviously your TF plays a huge role in this class, and Luis was great! The readings were interesting, course themes sometimes sort of random but also enjoyable. I wish there was a mandatory vocabulary notebook or something so I could force myself to learn more words, but that was more on me. Otherwise, I feel like my Spanish improved a ton!</comment>This is a good course, and the materials are interesting. You must be comfortable speaking Spanish a lot as all your exams and section participation will count on this. There are many compositions, which seem to be graded kind of arbitrarily, but overall a good course.</comment>Spanish 50 is a great course. I think it depends on your TF and Antonio is great! He is nice, knowledgable, encouraging and fair. It helps you become more comfortable with speaking, writing, and reading. I learned a lot of new vocabulary and enjoyed the course.</comment>Most people don't like the class because it was more work than they expected based on past Spanish classes. The class is more work than prior classes because there are compositions due almost every week and exams requires working with your group outside of class. Overall, it was a good class and really did help improve my speaking and writing skills immensely. Not too hard, just don't expect as low of a work load as before.</comment>Unless you are interested in theatrical performances, and have the time to commit to a ton of essays (basically one every week) and a lot of reading, do not take this class.  Take any other Spanish class if you are looking to hone your skills.  If you are interested and have the time, this class really helps to focus on the nitty gritty details of Spanish.  If you have trouble with any grammar tenses, be prepared to struggle.</comment>This course gives lots of opportunities to be creative by using skits and original papers as tests rather than traditional tests, practicing Spanish proficiency without doing lots of busywork worksheets. However, this is not the course for you if you are looking for a lot of grammar review, particularly during class-- grammar exercises are done at home and not really discussed. There's a fair (but manageable) amount of reading and lots of opportunities to improve speaking proficiency in class. It's probably advisable to have taken a fairly advanced Spanish recently, but overall a good way to practice Spanish.</comment>It is a great way to learn about Spanish-speaking authors and deeply analyze their works.</comment></course>MUSIC 175r: Special Topics</title>Fed IS my favorite professor on this campus. I have gained an in-depth ability to holistically explore repertoire and I have learned a lot about myself and my own learning style. Fed never fails to challenge and inspire me, and I am thankful to candidly receive that spark from him.</comment>Fed is wonderful. Spending time like this with Schubert is life-changing. That's all I have to say.</comment>great class if you love music</comment></course>APMTH 104: Series Expansions and Complex Analysis</title>Run, run, run away. There are better way of fulfilling this requirement, and better classes to learn complex analysis- with good course materials and enough resources to guide you through this fairly abstract topic. Head over to Math 113, Math 213, Math 55... Anything but this</comment>If Nitin is teaching this again, take it! After the first two classes I was ready to drop the entire course, but I'm really glad I decided to stick with it at the last minute because by the end of the semester it was by far actually one of my favorite courses. Don't be put off by the awkwardness at the beginning - Nitin is a really wonderful teacher. He obviously knows the material in and out, lectures are very streamlined, and he's incredibly kind and patient. Go to class - lecture notes don't exist, even for him. Homeworks are biweekly and reasonable, the in-class assignments are dreaded but helpful, and Jon is always happy to help too. Overall, really great class.</comment>Take this course if you feel you can teach yourself mathematics. The topics covered are super interesting, but the course is poorly organized and does not have any book or other notes to supplement lecture notes. Nitin is super helpful and goes above and beyond to be a great teacher.</comment>This is a small course for students interested in physics and learning different areas of math. It's interesting but it caters to a certain interests and if yours don't align then you shouldn't take it.</comment>This course, as it was taught by Nitin, was the structured in a very unusual way. At first this was strange, but it actually ended up making the course pretty laid back and manageable, despite the somewhat complicated material; there were no stressful exams, but rather multiple 'in-class assignments'. This helps you to keep up with the material without the stress of exams. Overall, it was pretty good and I learned a lot.</comment>Applied Math 104 covers the practical uses of complex analysis, but it tends to be a bit hand wavy on the theoretical side especially coming from a Math 23 background. The course is also not very well organized, with some parts that seem very distant from other parts. Math 113 is potentially a better option, but AM 104 is a solid 5th class, due to its low workload.</comment>This class is pretty useful, especially if you'd like a better understanding of Fourier transforms, singularities, and some derivations that become useful in probability (convolutions, random walks).  The prof was new this year, so organization of the course is likely to improve but, in general, Nitin was very approachable and humorous in lecture.  A more theoretical analog is available through Math 115 if that's more your style.</comment>The course with Nitin was fairly easy and deadlines were *extremely* flexible. I heard awful things about the course last year, so these reviews are only applicable if Nitin teaches this course next year. If it's someone else, take it at your own risk.</comment>This class teaches you some really interesting information, but it's not presented in a great way. You will leave with a much better understanding of how to use and manipulate complex numbers to solve problems, but it is something you could teach yourself.</comment>Depends on who is teaching!</comment>This class is taught by a new lecturer every year, so the class is not very well structured. The material taught in this class is pretty cool. I feel I have a solid foundation in complex numbers now. Complex numbers are important for a lot of real world applications. The class was not stressful at all.</comment>Good course to take in terms of material, but lectures and class structure were sub-par.</comment>It can be a very interesting course, but the structure was odd and slightly detracted from the overall learning experience.</comment></course>SYSTBIO 200: Dynamic & Stochastic Processes in Cells</title>Great class! Very chill! It's really nice that there isn't a final project or exam. You definitely learn alot from doing the psets!</comment>Problem sets teach a lot in this course, take them seriously and if possible solve questions in every possible way.</comment>Great class! Coming from the perspective of an undergraduate applied math-biology concentrator with more mathematical familiarity than biology, some of the biology was a little specific (especially because many of the students are graduate students in biophysics or systems biology with familiarity in the biological side of things). Really liked both parts of the class. Learned a lot about modeling cellular processes both dynamically and stochastically.</comment>Work hard and don't procastinate with the psets.</comment>This course is a great introduction to systems biology, and more broadly, to quantitative biology. Johan and Jeremy are really great lecturers who do a great job concisely conveying the main mathematical and biological ideas in a way that is easy to digest. Take this class if you are all interested in quantitative biology, it really changed my perspective on biology as a whole!</comment>One of the best systems biology courses at Harvard!</comment>Very good class! Really enjoyable even as an outsider to the field.</comment>A fantastic class to take if you are interested in systems biology. You won't want to miss Jeremy's lectures: they are so interesting and instructive. The workload of the class is not too terrible but you learn a ton.</comment></course>FRSEMR 37k: Horror in Literature and Movies: Cultural, Psychological, and Scientific Aspects of the Horror Genre</title>So fun, intriguing, and useful to movie lovers</comment>This class is amazing! Professor Schlozman is the best. You learn about an awesome subject through the teachings of an even cooler person. Horror movies are far more complex than I had ever imagined, and what the genre can accomplish is actually pretty amazing.</comment>Take this course if you enjoy being scared. This class is amazing and I would recommend it to absolutely everyone.</comment>I loved it. Probably the most enjoyable, fun, and rewarding class at Harvard.</comment>This is the best Freshman Seminar offered. Even though I initially hated the horror genre coming into this class, Dr. Scholzman opened my eyes to the intricacies behind the genre so that I now have a greater appreciation for horror. In this class you will watch some of the classic horror movies, read some amazing horror fiction, and dissect some of the critiques and scientific papers written on this genre. Dr. Scholzman is a wonderful teacher and really passionate about helping you to pursue your interest in horror whether that may be from the literary, film or scientific standpoint.</comment>Great course, please do take if you have to opportunity.  Teacher and material are the best.</comment>Take this course. Seriously. Words cannot even describe how much this class changed me. Professor Schlozman is one of the kindest, funniest, most compassionate and passionate individuals I have ever had the honor of meeting. He fostered such a positive and fun classroom environment full of exciting and inclusive discussion. Nothing feels like work in this class (especially since homework includes watching horror movies, reading horror stories/articles, and writing short stories) but I feel like I have gained so much from just a semester in this class. Discussions were always fun, interactive, and informative. Schlozman really shaped the class around the students, which was something that I loved. I am so sad that this class is over, but I am so grateful I had the chance to take it, and I know that I will stay in contact with my classmates and Professor Schlozman for the rest of my time at Harvard.</comment>One of the most fun classes i have ever taken and I absolutely loved it</comment>This is the best course I have ever taken. Learning from Dr. Schlozman was an honor, and every class  was a joy.</comment>If you enjoy movies and scary one without question take this course, do not worry about fulfilling gen ed's etc., take this class now when you have the chance.</comment>A fantastic class with a great teacher! I highly recommend it.</comment></course>HIST 1206: Empire, Nation, and Immigration in France since 1870</title>This is a fantastic course! I would recommend it for anyone interested in French history as well as French concentrators. It covers French and French-colonial history from 1870 to the present. The class was quite small, which made for great discussions and a close-knit environment. Professor Lewis and Lydia were always willing to meet, were engaging, and provided helpful feedback. Perhaps the best part of the course is that it requires "non-standard" assignments, like writing about an artifact from the Houghton Library archives, creating a World War II newsreel broadcast, and writing an interactive online chapter of a "book." The readings also include works of fiction and other texts that you might not otherwise read in a history class. Definitely take it!</comment>Definitely take this class If you are interested in issues of imperialism, decolonization, and immigration to Europe. Reading material is great (though it may seem a bit daunting), and the assignments are more engaging than the usual paper. I also enjoyed the very small size of the class.</comment>This class was an interesting way to discover French history from 1870. There is much reading to do on a weekly basis, but the materials are interesting with many different styles of writing (including fiction, memoirs, and more traditional textbook-style). Discussion is a major part of both lecture and section, so it is really important to stay on top of the readings. The assignments were enjoyable to create and allowed us to look at history in both biased and unbiased ways with respect to the Dreyfus Affair, World War II, and a topic of our choice. As a class, we would discuss the projects and attempt to combine all of our individual work into a collaborationist piece, adding another interesting dimension to the assignments. Both Professor Lewis and Lydia are extremely engaging and knowledgeable, and I have been lucky to learn so much from them about the history of France and its Empire, as well as about the creation of history in general.</comment>Fun and doable assignments. Professor Lewis is extremely informed and accessible and the workload is manageable. Take if you have an interest in French policy and themes--if you're looking for specifics or deep cultural analysis, the course be a little bit broad.</comment></course>HIST 2950hf: Approaches to Global History: Seminar</title>This class is very intense in the beginning and then intermittent for the rest of the time. The atmosphere of the class can be a bit cold at times, giving the impression that one must always say the right thing in discussion or risk judgement. This discourages all but the most fully formed responses.</comment>The access to WIGH fellows is an amazing opportunity.</comment></course>LING 98a: Group Tutorial - Junior Year</title>The tutorials I chose were both exceptional and I would take them again in a heartbeat. All of the grad students are amazing and kind and really work hard to make tutorial an enjoyable experience for all. Definitely the best part of concentration requirements!</comment>The tutorials are always great! Small class sizes, interesting discussions, and cool topics about human language.</comment></course>VES 60x: Fiction in the Flesh: Studio Course (Formerly Trials in Narrative Filmmaking)</title>Incredible. Athina is a goddess of cinema, Daniel is very knowledgeable and helpful. Best class I've taken here, made me wish I had done VES</comment>Take this! It was very time consuming but (unlike other courses I've taken) I didn't think twice about the amount of time I put in because of how rewarding and fun the class was.</comment>Best class I've taken at Harvard. Athina is outstanding. Incredibly knowledgeable, helpful and supportive--absolutely the best prof I've had at Harvard. Daniel is also amazingly supportive and available for help. Also super cool. I've left the class having learned a TON and feeling so inspired as a filmmaker and viewer of films.</comment>This class was amazing! One of the best classes at Harvard. I have no idea what the class will be like with a different professor next year, but I would assume that if they can get someone as awesome as Athina to teach it, it will be great. Definitely a great opportunity for people who have never been able to do fiction filmmaking to get the chance to do some really cool work.</comment>Just take the class as you will not only learn a lot about film making but in the process you'll learn a lot about yourself</comment></course>OEB 59: Plants and Human Affairs</title>Good class overall. The lectures were fairly interesting if you care about plants and their historical usage. Sometimes the anthropology side of things was a bit heavy. I would give this class a B for the most part, BUT. The tests were awful. For the midterm, we had no study guide, and only after some coaxing, they gave us ~5 practice problems, which were totally different and way easier than the test questions. For the final, also no study guide, but this time I knew that you just have to know absolutely every minute detail from lecture. The lab was fun and laid-back, lots of snacks. But there were 3 lab practical exams. It was strange to have unstructured, pure exploration labs and then be tested over them pretty harshly. If you know going into it that all the tests are difficult, then you'll be fine.</comment>I thought this course looked interesting during shopping week and it fit my schedule and my needs (needed an OEB course), so I decided to take it. I would not have revised that decision if I had the chance. The economic / human affairs portion of the course, which ended up being the bulk of it, could be made so much more interesting than it is. There is so much botany, which is not why I took the course. Exams aren't difficult per se, but you will not be given practice exams or any guidelines of what to study. So that's kind of stressful. Overall, good idea for a course but just not the best organization / content within that idea.</comment>This class is awesome. It's super duper chill, with very little work from week to week, and Prof. Davis is just amazing. I mean, our last lecture was on cannabis because he wanted to end "on a high note." It's a very laid-back lecture style where you just learn some cool stuff about plants and how we use them. There are some cool guest lecturers (and some not-so-great ones), and the lab component of the class is super awesome--basically just an excuse to eat in class. The lab practicals require some paying attention in lab, and the exams this year were very strange and the averages were surprisingly low, but I can overlook it in favor of how much I enjoyed the course overall.</comment>Incredibly interesting synthesis of botany, anthropology, and history. I feel better informed about where my foods and medicines come from after taking this class. It's also just a lot of fun. Professor Davis is a great storyteller and labs are a free-wheeling investigation of cool plants: looking, tasting, and asking questions.</comment>Go to lectures because the slides are mostly pictures and the labs are important to understand for the practicals--don't spend the entire team eating food despite how fun that sounds.</comment>Really good course.  I really enjoyed the labs and had a great time learning about plants.  Put in the time and you will get a lot out of this course!</comment>Pretty easy class. The midterm was awful and hurt most students.</comment>Course material is very interesting, the labs are SUPER fun and hands on (lots of things to taste and smell, etc!!), but the exams and lab practicals are difficult and comprehensive. make sure to study hard.</comment>Incredible class!!!! Plants influence every aspect of all of our lives. You will be surprised how relevant this class is, and you will be sharing fun facts with your friends all semester. Work load is low, and you will learn so much. The lab is the best part of the course. A lot of snacks, low stress, and just picking TFs' brains about plants. Great learning environment, highly enjoyable, workload low. Take this class!</comment>This class is an awful lot of fun and a particularly good course for non-science students.

OEB students be warned: this will satisfy a midlevel requirement but unless you engage the Professor and TF's about specific topics of interest you might find your intellectual curiosity unsated (this is an easy course relative to other OEB midlevels.)</comment>This was such a fun class!  You learn a bunch of really cool facts about plants and their uses.  There isn't much weekly work at all, but midterms and finals are definitely not easy.  Lab is also really awesome, in which you get to basically eat plant products and explore really awesome and cool plants!  The TFs and professor are all amazing individuals and teachers.</comment>This class is a lot of fun!  You learn a lot of cool facts and history about plants and their uses, and the labs are great (and tasty!).  It doesn't take a lot of time outside of class, especially if you have a good memory.  But definitely go to class, and take notes on all of the examples that are talked about in detail.  It is these examples (with names) that are tested on the midterm and final.  Once you know this, though, the tests were pretty straightforward.</comment>The material in this class is fascinating, and lectures are great. Lab is also amazing (tons of food every week, low-key environment where you just kind of explore). The exams are really weird though, which is why I gave this class a "moderate" in terms of difficulty. They feature one or two lectures (out of the 10 or 22 you are responsible for) incredibly heavily, so if you don't guess right you are kind of screwed.</comment>This is a fascinating class full of interesting ways in which humans use plants and plants help humans. You learn a lot about plant biology but it is all through the lens of plants that are useful to people, which makes the material less dry. Labs are a lot of fun and full of (often edible) plant specimens. The professor and TFs are very nice and really seem to be passionate about making the class an enjoyable and educational experience. It's also the oldest continually-taught course at Harvard, so there's that.</comment>fun class with low workload but you will learn a lot</comment>The class is low-stress and low-commitment, but that laxity extends to a vagueness about the structure of the final project and a total lack of preparatory materials for the exam. Eating in lab is fun.</comment>This class was really interesting.  Professor Davis is engaging and knowledgable.  Be aware that the exams were quite frustrating, however, as they asked for really small details.  Lab was a lot of fun--super relaxed, and always filled with snacks!</comment>Don't take it without talking to one of the students who has taken it before, the course description is not accurate</comment>Take good notes to supplement the lecture slides for midterm and final.</comment>I loved Professor Davis! He is a great lecturer and just seems like a great guy. The labs were really fun (we always had food!) but the practicals and tests were very specific, which made them tricky. A super interesting topic, but if you're going to take it, make sure you put in the time to know every detail before the exams and practicals!</comment>This class was incredibly interesting, and the professor and TA's were awesome. However, the class was a little unstructured, so be prepared for anything.</comment>This is a great class for anyone remotely interested in plants, especially for those who want some exposure to plants but without super intense biology.  The material is relevant to the real world and the teaching staff is amazing.  Also we got to go on a tour of a chocolate factory for lab.</comment>take this! Even if you dont like plants it's still really amazing! Lab is the best thing ever.</comment>I definitely recommend this course as a good option for fulfilling your OEB midlevel requirements, as it isn't too time-consuming and the material is also interesting, since it's presented from a unique viewpoint. The first few weeks are more botany-oriented, but after that it really moves into a more focused study of the different ways humans use plants.</comment>I took this class because I was missing an OEB mid-level, and not only is it a laid back class, but I ended up really liking it! Perhaps my favorite OEB class I've taken? The lectures cover a variety of topics, so it's fun to go and just learn about something completely different each time. Also, section was a lot of fun. Hands on and a lot of eating. But also they want you to ask questions, investigate the plants, and learn. I thought it awesome that Chuck went to section sometimes and talked to every student and just helped us grasp the material. The material of the course can be heavy on memorizing, but still not too bad a courseload.</comment>There's no reason not to take this class, especially if you're OEB. I hadn't taken a plant class yet and this helped me realize I'm not interested in plants but in the best way possible.</comment>This course is a lot of fun! It covers a lot of material, but the lectures are comprehensive and the labs are extremely fun!</comment>My favorite intermediate OEB class so far and probably will remain my favorite. Lab is actually great, which is rare in my experience. You eat AND learn a lot in it! The TFs and Prof Davis are great guys too.</comment></course>PSY 18: Abnormal Psychology</title>TAKE THIS CLASS! You will never want lectures to end. Buckholtz is the MAN!</comment>Buckholtz is a really engaging lecturer. His approach is very over the top, and while sometimes it can feel like he's making light of the conditions/experiences we talk about in class, generally it just feels like lightening the tone of pretty heavy material in order to make it approachable. (Be prepared to be frustrated and disappointed by his eating disorder lecture though). Overall though, he's definitely one of the most engaging professors I've had at college, and clearly gets super excited about the subject matter. He's also super clear about expectations, so you're never going to face a situation where something unexpected pops up on the exam.</comment>This class is great. The professor and teaching staff are amazing. The exams are also really fair. If you study the study guide, you will do well in this class. Take it.</comment>Solid course. Very interesting material with surprisingly entertaining lectures. Buckholtz is a boss. No bullshit. Honest perspectives on very relevant issues in psychotherapy. I would take this course if you're looking for an awesome psych-related elective or a more engaging alternative to cog neurosci if you need to fulfill your foundational psych requirement.</comment>TAKE IT! It's so much fun, and Professor Buckholtz is so hilarious and fun and awesome.</comment>Very very fun class to take if you're interested in psychology. Professor Buckholtz knows what he's talking about, but also finds a way to make his lectures funny and interesting. Little to no reading was necessary outside of class. One major paper and two midterms that were relatively easy and straightforward. He gives study guides!!!</comment>Great class, lecture is very fun and interesting.  Not really a need to read the textbook.  Exams are very straightforward, not super easy but extremely fair and if you study it's completely possible to ace them.  The hardest part of the class for me was the final paper.</comment>TAAAAAAKKKEEEE THIIIIIS CLAAAASSSS. Even if you're not a psych concentrator or psych secondary. The material is interesting and SO relevant, especially with current conversations about issues of mental health, prison reform, and the justice system, and professor buckholtz makes lectures so engaging, interesting, and fun. I guarantee you'll walk out of there every day having learned at least one thing that will make you a better person. Reasonable work (only one paper) and the exams were super reasonable and fair, with study guides and plenty of chances for review. Basically, lectures were so fun, the material was so interesting (like, so interesting I read the books for fun even though I didn't need to for the exams), and this stuff is stuff that you can actually use for the rest of your life. If you're scared of taking this without background info don't be; go to section, go to lecture, go through the study guides before exams, and you'll be A-ok. If you don't take this you're doing something wrong.</comment>This is a great psych class. You learn a lot, the material isn't that difficult, and Bucholtz is an awesome professor.</comment>This course was super interesting. I really enjoyed learning about different mental disorders and major issues in the field of abnormal psychology. This isn't just a class psych concentrators should take. It's a class worth taking for everyone. These are issues really worth thinking about.</comment>This is an awesome course. The content is fascinating and HUGELY important, so take it just for that. Professor Buckholtz is also amazing, as are the TFs. However, it definitely has its flaws / room for growth. The shortage of assessments (three exams and an essay) makes it tough to be confident about your grade and to consolidate the material. It also teaches DSM, which is quickly being made obsolete by brain-based diagnostic frameworks. The sections are huge and the paper is unstructured, so it's easy to get lost in everything and have a lot of stress toward the end trying to figure out the content and your paper. I hope they address these issues for next year since this is truly one of the most important courses offered and has a really solid foundation.</comment>Buckholtz is very cool.</comment>Buckholtz is fun, the material is fascinating. If you're going to take any psychology course, this should be it. Everyone should know this much about abnormal psychology.</comment>BEST COURSE EVER definitely take it. Buckholtz is amazing, probably my favorite professor at Harvard, he's hilarious and so enthusiastic about what he teaches. Looked forward to lectures and section because they were so awesome. I learned a ton and the material is super interesting. The exams were very fair and if you study then you will do well.</comment>This is an interesting course that introduces you to material that is tough, real, and very valuable to daily life / understanding others around you. Professor Buckholtz makes lectures very enjoyable and fun, and while it sometimes feels like we are covering too much material (without too much depth), I am glad I took it. Make sure to look at lecture slides before exams; they are the best form of study material.</comment>This is the most engaging class that I have taken at Harvard- I actually consistently wanted to show up to lecture. TAKE IT especially if you are a psych concentrator- its a no brainer. Engaging professor, super interesting subject material and workload is very reasonable.</comment>This is the best class I've taken at Harvard. Buckholtz is a godsent professor and you will learn so much. Take this class no matter what you're interested in because you will learn SO much and enjoy every second of your experience in Abnormal Psych.</comment>You will fall in love with abnormal psych (and maybe even Josh Buchholtz) if you take this course. If you care a lot about psych, this course will probably be unsatisfyingly easy for you. You will wish that the exams were more challenging (believe me) and you will feel like there's so much more that you could have learned in this fascinating field. If you don't care too much about psych and are taking it as an elective, it will be an easy A.</comment>This is a fantastic course that is fun and you learn a lot. The tests are also very straight-forward.</comment>Take this class! Josh Buckholtz is an incredible and hilarious professor and the material is extremely interesting. Not too difficult of a workload, and the grading is very fair.</comment>This is a basic introduction to abnormal psychology. If you are even slightly familiar with the material, take a higher-level course.</comment>This class is awesome. Professor Buckholtz is awesome. Super easy but (whoa) you actually learn a good amount, and it's interesting. Take it, especially if you're interested in the subject matter.</comment>This class is really interesting. You learn a lot about mental disorders, and it is all really cool and applicable to life. Professor Buckholtz makes going to class fun, and he shows the most interesting videos. If you are interested in mental disorders and how the brain changes to produce these differences, this class is perfect for you. Take it with Buckholtz!</comment>One of the best classes I've taken at Harvard. Super interesting and not difficult.</comment>This class is an absolute gem. Buckholz is super passionate and so are most of his TFs. His lectures are both engaging and enlightening. He's also hilarious. Probably some of the most entertaining parts of my day were in my class. His sarcasm is on point. He's also incredibly knowledgeable and clearly wants students to come away with a greater sense of the complexities in abnormal psychology. He cares much more that we gain a more holistic understanding than memorize nitpicky points. As a result, his exams are very straightforward. He makes it clear what material you are responsible for and if you study, you will get an A in this class. TAKE THIS CLASS (with Buckholz!). The workload is super manageable. The material is awesome as is but I think Buckholz made it even better. This class will blown your mind and I promise if you are interested at all in abnormal psychology you will be incredibly thankful you took this class.</comment>Buckholtz is AMAZING!!!! If he is teaching, you should take this class! Very low stress and time-commitment, but you learn a ton about an incredibly fascinating field of psychology.</comment>This is a GEM! One of the THE greatest courses taught at Harvard. One of the best, most entertaining, funny, enthusiastic, passionate, and intelligent professors alongside a very talented and passionate, devoted team of Teaching Fellows who articulate the material so well and are interested in speaking with students about career paths and future research. An extraordinary team Harvard, as well as myself, are thankful for.</comment>Abnormal psych with prof. Buckholtz is SO great. Don't take it with other lecturers!! It will not be as interesting and fun. This course will expose you a deeper dive into a lot of the mental health issues that are prevalent (and less prevalent) in society and give you a better understanding of the mechanisms behind them than you've probably internalized due to media/pop culture and even from previous psych classes you've taken. The work load is super doable--there are two midterms, a paper, and a final. The midterms and final were extremely straight forward, and the paper was on a topic of your choice.</comment>Psych 18 is a fun and low difficulty course in psychology. Buckholtz is a great lecturer and speaks to students as if we are his friends which makes it easier to want to learn in his course. I would definitely recommend this course to psych concentrators.</comment>I ultimately really loved this class. I found it to be a rare course that requires very little work and yet still feels very rewarding. Annie Spokes was a great TF and I looked forward to our discussions in section every week. Professor Buckholtz is quite a character, but he's entertaining and he makes all the information he teaches very easy to retain.</comment>TAKE THIS CLASS! Even if you have no future plans to go into psychology, take this class. Prof. Bucholtz is an amazing teacher and really cares about the students. The workload is TOTALLY manageable and so interesting. Learning about all the different psychological disorders is so interesting and was eye opening. I recommend this class to everyone</comment>Professor Buckholtz is one of the most entertaining lecturers at Harvard.  He makes class enjoyable, and the review sheets for exams are the best.  Loved the class.</comment>Absolutely take this class! If you are thinking of concentrating in Psych, it will give you such a sense for the field of Psychology. If you are not, it will give you a better tolerance and understanding of people and expand upon some of the most interesting parts of SLS 20. Buckholtz is an engaging, enthusiastic, talented professor! If at all possible, take it with him!</comment>Buckholtz is AMAZING. Definitely one of my favorite classes at Harvard!</comment>BEFORE YOU EVEN CONSIDER TAKING ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY WITH ANYONE ELSE, REARRANGE YOUR SCHEDULE AND TAKE IT WITH BUCKHOLTZ!! BEST DECISION EVER.</comment>one of my favorite classes at harvard with the best professor</comment>This class is INCREDIBLE!!! Take it, you absolutely won't regret it -- Professor Buckholtz is amazing and the TFs are amazing and just take the class.</comment>Prof. Buckholtz will give you a truly special experience. He'll teach you at a high level in a personal manner that makes a lecture feel more like a seminar. The course sometimes doesn't ask enough of its students, but it's nonetheless a great time and a good springboard for further exploration.</comment>Fun. Interesting. Pretty Easy. AWESOME PROF (Seriously).</comment>It's a very interesting course, essential if you have an interest in learning about or working with mental health.</comment>Solid class if you are interested in psych. Josh is great</comment>interesting class that you will learn a lot from</comment>Great class! Lectures are fun and engaging. Definitely don't need to do any of the textbook reading. The study guides are all you need!</comment>If Joshua buchholz is teaching them take the class</comment>This class is amazing and you need to take it. Prof Buckholtz is both an amazing teacher and an amazing human being; you will want to get to know him. I don't actually have the words to tell you how badly you need to take this class. Just take it.</comment>Take this class!! Professor Buckholtz is awesome, the teaching staff is great, the material is interesting, and the exams are completely reasonable. You don't even need to open the textbook for this class, so you essentially have no homework besides the paper or studying for the exams. Also, Professor Buckholtz gives you a study guide which outlines everything that will be on the exam, so they are very easy. No psychology/science background necessary and the material is fascinating.</comment>Best class at Harvard</comment>The best classes, in my opinion, are the ones that are educational, but not challenging in a painful way. This is one of those courses.
The material is excellent, and Buckholtz shows you why it is important.</comment>It is a perfect mix of a scientific and humanistic understanding of the topics associated with psychopathology.</comment>Buckholtz is an awesome professor and is super enthusiastic about what he teaches. Every lecture is lots of fun!</comment>LOVED this class!  the professor is amazing - his enthusiasm is contagious and you learn about really cool things.  workload is pretty chill.</comment>Please please take this class! It has been one of the best courses I've taken here at Harvard. Professor Buckholtz is the funniest, coolest, and most honest professor I've ever had. Not only does this course teach you a great amount on psychopathology and a wide range of disorders, but it also offers refreshing perspectives on the diagnosis and treatment of disorders. As well, it challenges you to think deeper about what it means to diagnose someone with a disorder, and how best to treat it. Lectures are engaging, sections are rewarding, and exams are very fair. Take this class!!!</comment>excellent class. very interesting subject matter. Prof. Buckholtz is both extremely engaging and super knowledgable about abnormal psychology. highly recommend it. tests are fair and buckholtz gives out pretty comprehensive study guides.</comment>This is the best course I have EVER taken in my life. I cannot say enough great things about this course.</comment>Easy to do well, all memorization and not that much, don't go into very much detail, not as much neuroscience as expected</comment>this class is awesome. it's fairly easy but you learn a lot of really cool and useful things.</comment>As long as it is still with Buckholtz, I would recommend this course to anyone.  One of the few courses in my Harvard career that I can say I genuinely looked forward to attending lecture.  Buckholtz is to a normal lecturer/professor what John Stewart is to normal news broadcasting.</comment>This class is absolutely amazing.  Professor Buckholtz is one of the most engaging lecturers I've ever had, and he makes the subject really exciting.  If you have any interest at all in mental illness or psychology, take this course.</comment>Buckholtz is an amazing, hilarious, vivacious, and searingly intelligent professor.  He keeps lectures fresh, interesting, and compelling, and the rest of the teaching staff follows his lead.  If you're at all interested in abnormal psychology or even psychology generally, you'll be hard-pressed to find a better course.  Exams are extremely fair, but start the research paper earlier than the teaching staff starts discussing it in class, if you want to have enough time to produce a polished prouct.</comment>The course is super interesting, and you get to learn about prevalent mental illnesses that affect a surprising amount of the population. Josh is a really fun instructor and really wants everyone to succeed</comment>Take this class, seriously. Where else are you going to find a teacher that buys the entire class cupcakes after an exam? But seriously, this is one of the best classes that I've taken. Professor Buckholtz is absolutely hilarious, not to mention extremely intelligent and engaging. He makes the subject of abnormal psychology so approachable and understandable. I was always excited to go to every class and every section because I knew that I would learn something extremely interesting, and get to experience the comedy act that is Professor Buckholtz. I'm so glad that I decided to take this course, and words can't describe how highly I recommend it.</comment>This is a great course to take! Especially with Professor Buckholtz. The material is extremely interesting and the workload is very manageable. If you take it together with other psychology courses or related mental health courses, this class can also be a very synthesizing experience for integrating a lot of perspectives on the field.</comment>Make sure you take this class when Professor Buckholtz teaches it. He brings an enthusiasm and sense of humor to every lecture that really makes the course enjoyable.</comment>Buckholtz is absolutely awesome, chill and down to earth. He cares about the topic, has the knowledge of a professor to back up what he's saying, but is down to earth like a student. You don't need the books at all. Just take down what the Prof says word for word and then compare it to the slides and fill out the study guide and you are good with exams. 

You will totally pass this class, because the study guide is a great reassurance that you know what you learned. 

The essay is rough, just get help early on if you struggle with writing.</comment>Professor Buckholtz is the man.</comment>Buckholtz is a legend. Straight up legend.</comment>Very easy class but you learn a lot of things about abnormal psychology.</comment>This is an amazing course! Professor Buckholtz is a great lecturer and class is always interesting. The exams are really fair and the topic itself is really cool to learn about. I feel like I have learned valuable information from this course.</comment>Cool info - reflection of your own life in many ways</comment>I would definitely recommend this class to anyone. The teaching staff makes sure that you learn and that the exams and assignments are manageable.</comment>This course is fun, fascinating, and completely relevant to healthcare today.</comment>This class is so much fun. Buckholtz is amazing and the material could not be more interesting. This is my favorite class that I've taken at Harvard.</comment>This class completely changed my outlook on classes at Harvard and provided me with more confidence. I cannot recommend it more enthusiastically!</comment>Take this class! If you have any interest in abnormal psychology, please take it. Professor Buckholtz is a fantastic lecturer. He is super enthusiastic and engaging. I would 100% recommend this course. There are several tests, but they are incredibly fair and you can get an A if you come prepared. TAKE THIS COURSE. JOSH IS AWESOME. One of my favorite psych courses I have taken at Harvard.</comment>THIS WAS THE BEST CLASS I'VE TAKEN AT HARVARD THUS FAR. It was so interesting and I found myself wanting to go to lecture twice a week (which can sometimes not be the case). You learn so much about abnormal psychology, which I find myself still talking about and using on a daily basis. Professor Buckholtz was also my favorite professor I've had thus far - he was hilarious and super smart. He loved what he was talking about and then you just fell in love with it too. He was so open to questions and comments in the midst of lecture or after class. He was the best. Coolest guy ever. But yeah, the subject material itself is intriguing but it's also important. Simply, take this class. I don't know what else to say, but it was amazing and life changing.</comment>Take it.</comment>It's a super easy class that would be great to take if you're especially interested in psychopathology. It can sometimes be frustrating when the teaching staff doesn't seem to have their act together as much.</comment>This is by far the best class I've taken at Harvard. I was excited to go to lecture every single time. Professor Buckholtz is incredible and really cares about the material and about his students. Even if you have no interest in psych, take this class. It's entertaining and practically useful as well. Take it take it take it!</comment>Don't bother reading the textbook cover to cover because it is not the most useful way to spend your time preparing for this class.</comment>If you want a really fun, dynamic class with a really cool professor, this is a great option.  Also very interesting material, of course!</comment>Best class in college. Prof. Buckholtz is a master showman and weaves comedy sketches into lectures. Even if psych isn't your thing take this class as one of those "wow" classes!</comment>This class is amazing! My favorite so far! You learn and a lot and Professor Buckholtz is so funny and interesting. His study guides are so great. Such a gem of a class!</comment>This class is amazing!!! Professor Buckholtz is an extremely captivating lecturer, and all the assignments were very interesting to do.</comment>This class is amazing. Professor Buckholtz is an incredible professor and lecturer. He made every lecture incredibly interesting and engaging. I also found the material to be very fascinating.</comment>This course provides a great opportunity to learn about psychopathology. Professor Buckholtz is an amazing professor and the course is both eye-opening and enjoyable. You will develop a strong sense of important issues to think about in regards to interpreting research in this field, as well as treatment and the ways psychopathology can impact psychosocial functioning.</comment>Prof. Buckholtz wants everyone to get As. He gives out study guides that lay out exactly what you need to study. No need to read the textbook. Show up to lecture, memorize the study guides, and you can get an A. Plus, he's hilarious.</comment>this class is INCREDIBLE. The course material is really fascinating, you learn about psychopaths, schizophrenics, etc. But Buckholtz is the real star. He is so engaging and funny and everything he says makes total sense. He is accessible outside of class, loves to get to know students, and has the cutest family of all time. Of all time. The exams are totally fair, if you study you will get an A. Can't recommend this enough, one of my favorite classes ever.</comment>It is a great introductory class, and definitely a fun experience with Professor Buckholtz!</comment>This class is very easy, entertaining,  and informational.</comment>If you are reading this, then you should absolutely take this course (only if Josh Buckholtz is teaching it). I've never been in a class as interesting and helpful as this one. It conquered many misconceptions I had, and the learning was so natural.</comment>Most interesting psych class I have taken.  Lectures held my attention and Professor Buckholtz is very down to earth.  Exams were not bad, just basic memorization.</comment>Prof. Buckholtz makes this class. The material is interesting enough, but his lectures are so engaging and help you learn without realizing you are learning. Can't recommend enough.</comment>TAKE THIS CLASS. Prof. Buckholtz and the TFs are absolutely amazing, the material is fascinating, and the workload is light. All of the necessary and sufficient causes for an excellent class.</comment>This is my favorite class that I have taken at Harvard to date. The material is super interesting, and Professor Buckholtz's passion for the course material makes it even more exciting and enjoyable to learn!</comment>absolutely amazing class with very interesting material</comment>This is an absolutely amazing course. Buckholtz is an outstanding lecturer and teacher, he's hilarious and kind. The material is fascinating and he makes it infinitely better with the amount of passion he exhibits about the subject. Anyone can get an A on the exams if they work on the study guide and look over the lecture slides, he doesn't try to trick you, it's very straightforward. Everyone should take this class, even if you don't want to concentrate in psych. It's a fun course and the things you learn are extremely eye opening to the kinds of disorders that we can find in the world around us. I found myself looking forward to this class every day and I wish I could just keep learning this and being taught by Buckholtz for the rest of my time here.</comment>This course is fun, and you do learn a lot about abnormal psychology. Prof Buckholtz is hilarious. However, the sections are a drag and you're unlikely to learn anything from them. Overall, though, it's a vanilla ab psych class and you should consider taking it!</comment>Buckholtz is a wonderfully engaging lecturer, loves what he does, and makes an effort to learn everyone's names. If you come to lecture and take notes on what the professor says (not just what is on the power points), you do not need to do the readings in order to do well. The exam study guides are extremely useful and virtually the only preparation you need for the exams. My section leader was highly disorganized, but Buckholtz was such an effective lecturer that sections were irrelevant.</comment>I would really recommend taking this class! The material is extremely interesting and Professor Buckholtz is an amazing lecturer!</comment>This course is absolutely incredible. Professor Buckholtz has managed to create and maintain a very rare course at Harvard that is incredibly interesting, where you learn a lot, while also not being so difficult that it deters people. EVERYONE SHOULD TAKE THIS COURSE! You will not regret it.</comment>This class is amazing. If you have any interest in psychology at all definitely take this. Professor Buckholtz is enthusiastic and funny and really makes you excited about lecture and learning the material. He also brings snacks often, it's amazing.</comment>Awesome lectures- Professor Buccholtz is the bomb. Go to class!!!</comment>Prof B is the best ever! Take this class if you have a remote interest in the subject matter.</comment>Take it and you will love it!!!</comment>You should take it.</comment>take this class with buckholtz!</comment>Take it!</comment>Take this class! Professor Buckholtz is an amazing lecturer, and the exams are fair. Psych 18 will give you a wonderful background on abnormal psychology. You'll be engaged and makes the material is interesting as well as accessible for undergraduates.</comment>This class was fantastic. TAKE IT if you get the chance. The workload is light and Buckholtz is hilarious, brilliant, empathetic, etc. I learned a ton and the info has really stuck with me. You will have two midterms and a final, and you'll get a comprehensive study guide for each (making exams a breeze).</comment>AMAZING class. Interesting material taught every single lecture. Professor Buckholtz is amazing and he really really cares about this material which makes it an even better class.</comment>This class is very interesting. It is well taught. The professor is great and so enthusiastic about the material. The exams are very fair, and graded very fairly. The writing assignment is a very fun way to delve into a topic of interest to you. I feel as though knowledge of mental illness is an extremely important thing in today's world. Many movies and magazines paint a very distorted picture of what mental illness is, and since mental illness is relevant in the courtroom and in our everyday lives (friends, family), a more accurate understanding of it is critical. This class was a great course, both for psych majors and those looking for a cool (and somewhat challenging elective)!</comment>TAKE THIS CLASS</comment>Very interesting. Not a lot of work. I think I learned some cool stuff. Occasionally a disorganized class and occasionally seems like Buckholtz doesn't really care about the students, but overall I would recommend taking.</comment>The material in this class is so, so interesting, but unfortunately it doesn't seem like a lot of the teaching team takes it seriously. The exams were extremely easy as long as you studied the study guides; everyone who actually cared would easily do well. The TF you have also makes a big difference in how much you take away from this course; my TF, Alexandra, was fantastic, but I've heard some not-so-good feedback about some of the others.</comment>The material is very interesting, and Professor Buckholtz is a hilarious lecturer! Maybe at times a little too much so... but definitely livens things up!</comment></course>ENGLISH 90tb: Literature and the Rise of Public Science: Seminar</title>This class is great. It's very fun and engaging. You will learn a lot, but you really have to do the reading or you won't be able to participate in discussion. The reading is interesting, though, so don't worry.</comment>This is a fascinating class if you are interested in the literary technologies used by scientists in the 17th and 18th century and the ethical questions posed by science. The amount of reading can fluctuate, but is never way too overwhelming. Professor Osadetz is an interesting and cool person! Definitely take the opportunity to get to know him.</comment>This class offers a variety of readings, so it does well to cater to students with a wide array of interests. That being said, readings can often be lengthy and dense (although sometimes reading every single thing isn't necessary.)</comment>It is an extremely interesting and worthwhile class. As a science concentrator, it was pretty eye-opening to see how science was incorporated into famous works and how the famous thinkers of their time contributed to the development of modern science. The workload isn't stressful, which allows students the opportunity to enjoy the readings and discussions. Discussions are also wonderful for experimenting with and fleshing out potential paper topics.</comment>This is a great class, but the readings are dense and tricky.</comment>This course has an intriguingly varied reading list and will probably be even stronger now that it's been through its first round. Professor Osadetz is an engaging seminar leader and is excited about the material. Not a life-changing class, but an interesting one.</comment>I am thrilled I chose to take Professor Osadetz's seminar in his first fall at Harvard. I feel like I added some knowledge of the 17th century to my English arsenal, and am pleased that we now have someone in the department who knows the period well. When you're considering 90 level seminars, know that this is a highly rewarding option even though you may be less familiar with the material at first. Highly recommend to students who believe a departmental seminar should force you to engage with material you hadn't previously encountered.</comment></course>PHYSCI 2: Mechanics, Elasticity, Fluids, and Diffusion</title>PS2 is a good introduction to physics if you have never taken it before. If you have, the first half of the class will be incredibly boring but do not underestimate this class. If you put no work in, you will face problems on the final.</comment>You learn important physics. Not such a painful class besides the pointless labs and psets/sapling problems which take forever.</comment>PS2 is everything you would expect it to be. If you've taken a high school physics course, there should be no surprises. If you are looking for something more challenging, I wouldn't say this course is for you.</comment>This is not the way to learn physics. You will not leave with a working knowledge or intuition about physics. Lectures are 200 person sections and not helpful at all. Furthermore the tests are simply testing how well you can algebraically rearrange physics equations and not if you actually know the physics behind them.</comment>The course format is pretty poor and the lectures are very difficult to follow despite extensive physics education previous to this course.</comment>I would say that this is not a course to be taken just for the general education requirement. While the material is interesting and the class structure is more fun than being purely lecture based, the concepts are difficult and not always well explained by the professors.</comment>PS2 is a pretty good class. Lectures are good and require a little bit of thinking, problem sets are fair overall, and exams are manageable.  Your attitude in the class will probably influence how much you like/hate the course.  The class is mostly pre-meds, and most complain/stress about the course.  Don't do this, and you will be fine.  A note to people who have taken any previous courses in physics or AP physics in high school: there are some new concepts, and the numerous examples from biology may be interesting/helpful, but you probably won't find the course very challenging and should take that into account when choosing a physics course.</comment>Good class with clear learning expectations. Be prepared to study on your own as well though.</comment>Study in advance if this is your first time taking physics. The lecture format is absolutely terrible. Not conducive to learning for all students. Essentially this year we were lab rats.</comment>The professors are so nice and really want to help you. This is probably the lowest stress physics class you could possibly take here at Harvard, (obviously still some stress because it is physics, but the class is set up in a way to make it as easy as possible). The work load is very manageable. The best part about the class is the group midterms.</comment>Doable workload. Great teaching, and cool topics that you explore through physical phenomena.</comment>This is hard if you have never taken physics and math/physics isn't your strong suit.  It's very bearable though.  Logan and Louis are AMAZING!! They care so much and really want everyone to succeed and it really shows.  Go to office hours!  Start sapling early because it's a pain.</comment>The strengths were the advanced technology and class demonstrations and dedicated professors. It was great to have posted notes and lecture videos. The dedicated profs and teaching staff made the course enjoyable. However, in the first half of the semester there were definitely not enough office hours and help rooms were WAY too busy. This course is really challenging and the psets take around 14 hours a week...so that's not very fun! But Logan and Louis are amazing and love physics so much! Louis posts fabulous notes and is always offering extra office hours to answer questions. Just be willing to spend long long hours working on the psets.</comment>Teaching was really great and it's definitely possible to do very well even if you have little physics knowledge going in!</comment>This class really requires you to go to office hours in order to really understand the material, as well as re watch the lectures.  Never leave the Psets until the day before.  Always do them early because you will definitely have questions.  make sure to read the pre reading because often times the class will stem from that material and you will feel lost if you didn't really understand the pre reading and only glimpsed at it.  Devote a lot of time to understanding the material.  If you do not it will be hard to catch up by the time the exams roll around.</comment>I really enjoyed this course. I can't say the same thing about the homework assignments but they did help me learn. The professors are really enthusiastic and everyone is willing to help. I loved the demonstrations they did in class. I think this class was doable because I had already done AP Physics in high school but if I hadn't I would probably think that its not the best way to to learn physics for the first time. Its fast paced and assumes you know a lot and also depends on group learning during lecture. I would rather there be more instructional time during lecture.</comment>This is overall a very painless class to take. However, don't get behind. You must know your concepts (not equations, concepts) cold before entering an exam, because they make multiple choice questions worth 4 or 5 points each, making it very easy to lose lots of points at once. Sapling might be annoying, but it's also how you learn and isolate mistakes in your problem-solving steps, and if you check your steps with people, you can get good grades on all psets anyway.</comment>Overall, well-taught and fair. The labs are a bit of a pain but only every other week.</comment>A lot of work, you need to keep on the ball the entire time because if you start slacking after second exam the final will be a huge slap in the face.</comment>It's great. Just make you sure you get as much practice as possible for the final!</comment>Office hours are crucial. Can't get the psets done without them (more so than other premed classes)</comment>Final exam was really hard. Everything else was fair</comment>If you hate physics, this class is for you. It really is not bad, and I think you really learn a lot</comment>I had a great experience in PS2! The instructors are so willing to help with any questions you may have. At first I was skeptical about the new teaching strategy, having been so accustomed to lecture style science classes. However, the interactive teaching style was highly effective. While PS2 is very challenging, don't be afraid to take it even if you don't have any background in physics. Most students have already taken AP Physics so you will have to do some catching up, but it's worth it!</comment>just do your work and you'll be fine!</comment>Really liked the new interactive components of lecture and the group exam! I think the new teaching principles are really effective, but the organization could be a lot better - uniform section notes and answers, relevant Friday review sessions, review for the midterms and final, more practice questions that are similar to the exams.</comment>It's the best physics option for pre-meds who want to do a fall-spring physics sequence. But it's still not great.</comment>While this is a pre-med course, the class tries to be non-competitive with its heavy group focus. Even if you're pre-med and physics doesn't seem too interesting to you, it's still interesting in the application of physics to concepts that would be interesting to you. The range of things to which physics applies is a bit surprising, and it becomes apparent over the course of the semester why med schools consider physics to be so important. The group theme of the course makes class time more active, so you'll want to get a group of friends in the course to work with (or make friends in the course by working with them) and go to lecture rather than watching online. The course isn't particularly difficult, but unless you're really good, you'll still have to put time in to get the hw done and prepare for the tests. Definitely better than I'd expected!</comment>I think Physics 2 has a great staff that works really hard to make sure you succeed. Physics in general is one of the least liked sciences and I think they did a great job at making it engaging. I did not think that the psets or lab were that stressful. However, that being said, I think a lot of self-study and practice is needed to do well on exams and if you don't keep up with it, it can catch up to you.</comment>This course is super fair, and the material is not that bad. If you study using the extra practice problems (not sapling), you'll be fine. The professors are great and its a great premed course.</comment>I loved physics in high school and still could not enjoy this class. Look into alternate physics class options. I'm sad I did not.</comment>Lectures are extremely unhelpful so expect to learn everything on your own but exam questions are fair</comment>Go to section and you will be fine.</comment>Easy, well-taught course. Very painless way to learn a lot about physics. The teaching staff is extremely friendly and easy to approach, both in and outside of class</comment>If you took AP Physics, the physics you do in this class doesn't go much farther than that.  Logan is great, Louis is not.  Good luck navigating the impressively inefficient and frustrating labs.  The curve is ridiculously easy- I bet the average grade in this class is an A-.</comment>This class is a really interesting, really good introduction to physics. The material is very engaging and Logan and Louis are very dedicated to making sure that their students  understand the material.</comment>Good intro Physics class. Extremely helpful teaching staff. Take it.</comment>ugh take it if you must. lord have mercy on your soul.</comment>Don't be intimidated, do go to office hours</comment>The course does start out easy, but it doesn't stay that way. Make sure you consistently do your homework, then you will be fine.</comment>AWESOME course. I'm lowkey obsessed with Louis and Logan. Their demos make the material really exciting and they always make sure you realize how relevant everything is. Physics is really hard material, but they did an amazing job of teaching it in a way that I could understand. They also have loads of office hours which is rare and great.</comment>This class is a good class to take if you want to fulfill the physics requirement for non-physics concentrators. It gives a good basic introduction to mechanics and fluids with a large overview without going too much in depth.</comment>I was terrified of this class, initially, but as the semester went on physics became more accessible. The teaching style and group exams really helped solidify concepts.</comment>Fairly painless way to fulfill a physics pre-med/vet prerequisite. Louis and Logan are wonderful, and make lecture not terrible at all. The whole double homework (Sapling/offline) thing is a bit annoying, but not too difficult at the end of the day. The whole activities/lecture format works better than a lot of people give Louis credit for--you actually have to engage in lecture, which helps with a lot of things sticking. Give it a chance!</comment>This class (pre-final) was relatively easy, which surprised me. The midterms were both very manageable and reflective of the section problems especially. The final came out of nowhere, and I scored 20pts lower on that than my midterms average, but then again so did basically everyone. It made the course end on a sour note, but overall they really do try their absolute best to make the course work for people.</comment>PS2 definitely surpassed my expectations for physics. I found myself actually engaged in lecture because it was so hands on. The labs were not bad at all - kind of fun. The material was difficult and sometimes I felt frustrated in lecture because it felt like nothing was really being explained to us very clearly, but there were plenty of resources available to students (TFs, office hours, online videos), and in the end, I would say this class offered me a definitely positive learning experience.</comment>too boring. lectures are useless</comment>This is a solid, pretty straightforward introductory physics course. They have been trying out a new teaching style based on problem-solving during class, and while I think this is a better way to learn than pure lecturing, I think they sometimes focused on the problem-solving at the expense of presenting actual content. I think a better balance needs to be struck between presenting/explaining concepts and problem-solving during lecture. That being said, this is not a super-difficult course and if you put in the work (especially if you have a high school physics background) it shouldn't be too painful. Labs are also pretty fun, which I was surprised by.</comment>It's really nice to take a course where the professors actually care</comment>You likely have to take this class, so I know this doesn't mean much.  Be aware that this class does require a lot of time and energy, and is frustrating at times.  I would say that the professors are trying to find ways to make the class more interesting and more effective, so it is encouraging to see that they really are trying to fix the fact that students dislike it.</comment>Very well-run class with two top-notch professors. They really care that you not only do well in the class but understand the material. Section TFs are all very professional and communication outside the classroom is on point.</comment>It is interesting to see how physical principles apply to biological systems. However it can be difficult to realize this as you're going through the course, because there's a lot of material to learn (especially when it comes to fluid statics and dynamics). Overall it's a very manageable course..lab only 6 times a semester is great. It is definitely much easier to manage the course work if you have a background in physics from high school and some calculus (though not necessary).</comment>No one in the class wanted to be there. Not as bad as it could have been. The only learning you'll do is with Logan, and be careful since Louis isn't listed as an instructor, who only starts teaching after add-drop. 

Two big psets due on the same day every week. Lab was a pain in the back to do, only tedious work. If you're considering it, I suggest doing AP 50 or 15a instead. This class tries too hard. One plus, however, is that you get group exams which can potentially save your grade.</comment>This class is one of the most straightforward you will take at Harvard -- if you go to lecture and section and take advantage of all the practice and review resources made available, you will learn something about physics</comment>You have to take this class, so, yeah.</comment>Take it if you have taken AP physics before, have no serious interest in physics, and want a decent grade. It's not the greatest physics class in the world; it's not the worst.</comment>This class makes it really obvious how physics relates to everyday life - and they make a concerted effort to make it relevant to premed students, in particular. As a premed req, ps2 is the best choice for physics - it's painless, interesting, and can be fun</comment>Make sure you study the Sapling. The questions on offline and review were harder than the actual exam. Multiple choice questions were hard</comment>While you will have to work hard to bridge the gap between lectures and assignments, this course covers important topics in a way that is accessible and that uses interesting biological examples.  So for pre-meds who need to take physics but don't want to take anything too physics-y, this is the best option.</comment>Best option for pre-med physics- Logan is an awesome lecturer and exams are fair.  Don't expect to be super enthusiastic about the material but you will learn things.</comment>Take this physics to get it out of the way- it's not the most fun, the material is taught in a very on the surface way, but you will be reminded of the physics you need. The plus is the loose the connection the class has with medical concepts- it was great taking it concurrently with LS2!</comment>This is a very painless way to satisfy the physics requirement for premed and Logan and Louis really care about the students and do everything in their power to make sure we are well supported</comment>Work hard and understand the lectures and homework and you will be fine.</comment>It's not as bad as it once was.  PS2 has been restructured somewhat from previous versions, and the class' collective performance shows that these changes were useful.  I thought that midterms were very reflective of what we learned in class.  Problem sets take a long time to complete, and office hours are crucial, but the offline components are graded on completion, which makes the problem sets a little less stressful and gives an incentive to actually learn how to do the problems rather than just get every detail so as not to lose points (as pre-meds tend to do in other classes).  The focus on problem solving during lecture is a huge help.  My only complaints are that we didn't do very difficult problems in the lecture activities.  Derivations and basic applications are important, but the final exam required some more advanced application, and it would be nice to have that in lecture.  Application problems have a place, but not on high-stakes, high-stress assessments.</comment>This is the physics lass to take for premeds. It is not too difficult even if you have no physics experience, as long as you keep up with the material and ask for help. Louis's great.</comment>In this course, you have to be prepared to do a lot of practice and outside-reading to solidify concepts covered in class. Go to office hours and work in study groups.</comment>Easy but that's it</comment>A great way to learn physics in a biology/medicine context. Great lecturers and well-organized class overall, even though it is a large class.</comment>It's definitely a requirement for a lot of things and is thus inescapable, but as physics classes go, it could be a lot worse.</comment>You probably have to take PS2, so go into it with an open mind and you could end up really liking it. I thought it was awesome. The material was interesting, and the teaching staff were great. If you can't get Anna as a TF, try to find out when her office hours are and go to them. She's a fantastic teacher, and hilarious. Logan and Louis are also great teachers, so go to their office hours if you're confused on anything. 

Go to help room for p-sets or Sapling. 
Do sapling before offline homework, sapling is usually easier and gets you used to the equations before having to think really hard about combining them in offline homeworks.
That said offline homeworks are graded for effort so don't kill yourself over them. 
Making a sheet of equations/major concepts as you go along is really helpful for the midterms/final, especially when you're making your final equation sheets to bring to the test. 
Go into the class with an open mind! If you like physics at all, you'll enjoy it.</comment>I don't like physics very much but this class is great.  Louis and Logan are great Professors who really care about improving the course and making sure we learn the most that we can</comment>It's a fine course -- if you're not comfortable with taking some of the classes in the Physics department itself, PS2 gets the job done in a solid manner. Also, the mole hill joke.</comment>Although the teaching staff are very dedicated to the course, it is not well-taught. You must seek them out if you are confused because they do not teach the material in class. Most of the time is spent deriving the equations and working on activities. Be sure to stay on top of the material because it will catch up with you once exam time comes. Exams and assignments are generally fair.</comment>A good class, you probably have to take it anyway but it's fairly well-run. The new format with activities during class is a bit jarring at first, but I think overall it actually did help facilitate more active learning.</comment>PS2 has changed a lot, and I think in retrospect the changes have been good. It has been the most enjoyable pre-med course I've taken thus far here. While I was initially daunted by the prospect of lecture being solely activity based (they tried this new 'flipping the classroom idea' where you read about the concepts you need to know in a very brief background 'pre-reading,' then come to lecture and get into groups to do activity problems based on the new concepts), I think it did, in fact, help me learn the material better. I also liked the addition of group midterm exams after the individual exam. Logan and Louis are both fantastic instructors who know the material well.</comment>The best pre-med, intro to physics option available.</comment>Amazing course! Super enthusiastic teaching staff (with oodles of office hours, and a philosophy that 'we want to be tired by the time lecture is over'), engaging lectures (challenging activities-based learning BUT definitely the best way to learn and have things stick... for the MCAT), and tons of extra support (they go above and beyond with problem solving videos and other materials online).</comment>This course is honestly not bad at all. I took regular physics and high school, and while I felt disadvantaged for the first 4 weeks, the rest of the semester I was on even footing with everyone. Just make sure you get a tutor or something early on in the semester, and you should be able to hold on.</comment>Class is relatively light, and the material doesn't move too fast. Ample resources by TFs in help hours. Many resources in terms of preparing and studying for the exam: all lectures recorded, all course materials uploaded to website, TFs respond to messages quite quickly.</comment>There are so many resources and they try to really help you to do well.  Careful, because it's easy to get screwed over on the midterms and ultimately get a poor final grade.</comment>Great professors who truly care about the students' learning and constantly look for ways to improve their teaching. Definitely take advantage of their office hours and the other resources open to you.</comment>Very well organized, staff is great!</comment>The review problems were usually more difficult than exam questions. The problem sets and sapling can be tedious. Labs aren't too bad. Felt like the final was not very fair.</comment>This class is not the big-bad pre-med class it is made out to be. It is extremely accessible information, the staff is really kind and helpful, and the workload is not high. Don't take AP50.</comment>PS2 is a great class to gain a solid foundation of basic concepts in physics. Problems are usually pretty straightforward. If you're looking for more of a challenge, I would take higher level physics classes, but PS2 is really great at teaching you the basics. Help room before psets are due or before the exam is super helpful, and I would definitely try to get to know Louis and Logan - wish I'd done that earlier in the year! Both are eager to help students understand concepts and genuinely care for them.</comment>PS is not a course about which you should be concerned or at which you should be annoyed. Rather, if you are dreading physics as I was, view this class as an opportunity to better understand the biology and chemistry you love, and to have your eyes opened to the more mathematical reasoning behind those biological concepts. Logan is also a really great instructor--I would encourage you to get to know him and go to office hours! Louis is also great--in fact, in my experience the teaching staff in general was really helpful and enthusiastic.</comment>I adored this course. It was my hardest class this semester and I may not have done well by most people's standards but I learned so much and really enjoyed my time in this class. Each lecture I left having learned something new and interesting about how the world around us works. The course staffers are amazing and super helpful. The professors are super approachable and helpful as well. I came into this course thinking I hated physics and it wouldn't be useful, and I left realizing that physics is all around us and that I loved it. Even if you are not good at physics (like me!) you will get a ton out of this class.</comment>well taught.</comment>The class is very easy and lectures are excessively slow and dull</comment>The teaching staff is amazing. They really want you to do well and to develop a true interest in the material. Even as a person with little background in physics, I found this course to be super fair.</comment>Take AP 50 if you are premed and think you can do group projects. Or if you are like me and hate group projects, take this class and do as well as you possibly can on the midterm exams and on the homework (SAPLING IS NOT COMPLETION SO DON'T F THAT UP) and lab (LAB ALSO IS NOT COMPLETION SO MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE WRITING IN THE POST LAB AND CHECK WITH TFs) because the final will destroy your grade like chipotle does your bowels.</comment>Just stay on top of the material and sapling is actually really helpful though frustrating at times.</comment>It's not an easy class, but there are a lot of opportunities to get help.</comment>The style of this class consists mostly of doing activities and only a little bit of lecture. If you know a bit of physics and you think the hands on approach to learning works for you then you will really like this class. If you don't know a lot of physics or prefer to learn by someone telling you the concepts and explaining them, then you might struggle in this class.</comment>This class had potential so did i before I took it.  No med school for me but maybe you'll do better (LOL). The course is curved on years past so it means that you are not competing against your peers.  The psets were useless except for the last one where one problem appeared on the exam.  my biggest problem with this class is that the material that they emphasized the least made the most appearance on midterms and finals.  It was almost as if they knew where their weaknesses were as a teaching staff and instead of addressing it, they capitalized on it greatly to differentiate those who took AP physics C in high school from those who didn't. If you are taking this class without any prior knowledge of physics.. I'm sorry but there is nowhere to run. you have no choice.  The fact that you are reading this means that you are a premed either stuck taking this course or Physics 15 (and we all know that's not an option).  Good luck. The second half of the course and professor (Louis) was great.  I couldn't even with the first half.... at all... the final exam... das rude.  Centripetal force is key to passing this class.</comment>I really liked this course. The physics taught is great and never too difficult to understand. Logan and Louis do a great job lecturing. And I really enjoyed the class overall. If you enjoy physics but don't want to suffer through one of the more in-depth mechanics classes (i.e. physics 15a or 16a), take this course. Also good for premeds as it uses biological applications of physical principles fairly often.</comment>Stay on top of the saplings, and you will do fine. I imagine I will get about an A-, having studied only one night for the final, and I think this was because I tried to work through the sapling by myself throughout the year.</comment>Find studdy buddies. Go to office hours. Start the sapling early!</comment>Make sure you understand torque and liquids.</comment>I honestly actually enjoyed this class more than I thought I would going in.  The workload is tough, but definitely doable if you stay on top of things.  I had mixed feelings about the new teaching style of the course this year that got rid of conventional lectures - I think it was good for some topics but made learning others more difficult.  If you're someone who really learns best in a conventional lecture-style class, then I'd recommend doing a different physics course, but otherwise I think this one is the best for pre-meds.</comment>Solid class. New lecture style is great, keeps you awake!  I was scared of physics before entering PS2, but I think the new lecture style and the helpful professors/section leaders really made a difference.</comment>good premed physics requirement, not terribly time intensive, and much help available. like how it's made applicable to different areas of medicine</comment>This class is probably the best physics option-- the professors and section leaders all try their very best to help you out and make it as good a class as it can be.  If you dont have a previous physics background coming into this class, I would advise taking advantage of all the office hours you can from the very beginning and really thinking about the concepts of each module early!</comment>This course is exactly what it advertises to be. Take it if you have concerns about taking higher-level physics or wan a more biologically oriented class. Be ready to engage fully with the course material though.</comment>If you are a person who learns best in groups, this is a great physics class for you. Midterms are deceivingly easy; final was very difficult.</comment>It's not as painful as you'd think physics could be!</comment>Though I struggled in this class, I enjoyed it overall. Logan and Louis were both good professors, and many help opportunities were offered throughout the semester. In terms of pre-med classes, this was both more enjoyable and more manageable than organic chemistry.</comment>The material can definitely be difficult. But Professors McCarty and Deslauriers are wonderful and give engaging lectures full of demonstrations. The teaching team clearly wants you to succeed.</comment>some topics are presented really easy, and others are just presented assuming you will pick it up, so be aware of that.</comment>It seems like this class has improved from the past. The grading seemed fair and the teaching was good. The teaching staff provided many opportunities for students to catch up on material (section, reviews, etc). I think it is difficult to avoid spending a significant amount of time learning the material for this class, but if you do learn it, you will do well.</comment></course>ITAL Ab: Beginning Italian II: The Art and Craft of Italy</title>You should be interested in learning Italian because the course covers a lot of material. Julianne was an excellent TF!</comment>Julianne is a phenomenal TF who is somewhat intense but will really make you want to work to understand Italian. This course is incredibly grammar-heavy but will teach you a lot in a short amount of time.</comment>The class was taught very well.</comment>The class is something of a grind, as most language classes are, as it meets every day and has almost nightly assignments. However, if you put the work in in class, it will be a very rewarding semester.</comment>Italian Ab teaches essential grammar portions of the language following and expanding upon that taught in Aa but also furthers the cultural connection of the language. There is more interaction with different forms of media (songs, movies, etc) and culture (fashion, arts, industry, etc) that make the language more applicable to use in a richer context. The course requires a lot of time to fully grasp the language, but it teaches a lot of material and, in my opinion, really advances your ability to speak and understand the language beyond a basic level.</comment></course>HAA 272z: Post WW II European Art (Part II) : Seminar</title>With the proper background in art history, a class with Buchloh is the essential next step. Having him for present and engaged in every discussion is invaluable.</comment>The class is intellectually demanding, but highly rewarding. Professor Buchloh is a star in the department, as well as in the art world more generally. He is incredibly insightful and forceful, but also approachable and helpful.</comment></course>EXPOS 20.132: Philosophy of the State</title>You receive quality instruction in this course, and the instructor is very generous with his time. However, it is less about Philosophy of the STATE than you might think. A lot of it is actually about the family, which comes up in discussion as a contrast to the state. The final paper is actually focused on the family more than the state.</comment>NAH</comment>The class has a fairly high work load, but Dr. Chen was very helpful in helping me improve as a writer.</comment>A lot of reading and he's a hard grader. A very good teacher though—he's very smart and very nice.</comment>Unfortunately, I am unlikely to recommend this course. Although Professor Chen is passionate about the subject, the course overall doesn't meet its expectation. The purpose of an Expos class to educate freshmen about writing skills; however, this class did not provide useful resources for fulfilling that purpose. The class discussions and readings are centered on philosophy, but with no connection to lessons on writing. The work is manageable with effort, but it barely relates to the essays. The essay topic are reasonable, but very little guidance is provided. The feedback provided on the drafts is very vague and unhelpful for the final drafts. On top of that, grading is on the harsher side. It is very difficult to ask for constructive feedback since office hours are not very accessible. The syllabus is not followed throughout the semester and this creates much confusion. Some of my peers obtained more writing resources and guidance from other Expos classes. Thus, I would not recommend this particular class to fulfill the Expos requirement.</comment>Lot of work/reading but very rewarding.</comment>I thoroughly enjoyed this course, but I know many people didn't. Be prepared to read a lot of dense, philosophical works (many of which don't have SparkNotes or other summaries posted online) and work hard on your assignments.</comment></course>GOV 94dn: Mapping Social and Environmental Space</title>this course is one of the best i've taken! it's extremely useful, well-organized, interesting, and applicable to so many disciplines outside of the gov department. you leave the course with an amazing depth of knowledge about mapping techniques and GIS software. professor srinivasan is also incredibly brilliant and kind - she makes the labs, which do take a bit of time (4-6 hours), very manageable and enjoyable. the midterm and final project were also structured very reasonably, and even felt rewarding since they were focused on a topic of your choosing!</comment>Great introduction to GIS. It's not a typical gov course- it's really more about learning the skill than learning about a particular topic</comment>Totally manageable workload in the form of weekly labs makes for steady absorption of the material. Sumeeta is the ideal instructor. Knowledgeable, accessible, down-to-earth.</comment>If you have any interest in learning GIS, this class is entirely worth it. Sumeeta is extremely helpful and it is just a great environment in which to learn the software as well as learning to apply it to social/political issues.</comment>This a phenomenal class that teaches methods that can really be applied to research questions in any discipline. If you are considering taking it, definitely take it.</comment>Working with Sumeeta is a joy. She is gifted with GIS and, just as importantly, kind, flexible, patient, and thoughtful when working with students. I took this class as an elective, and I was one of the few students who did that; most students took the class in conjunction with a thesis or some other sort of research. If you are going to take as an elective, be warned that there is a good deal of in depth work. It is not an easy out of concentration class. But if you are willing to deal with the difficulties of learning the program, there is a generous payoff.</comment>This course REALLY teaches you ArcGIS. If that's a skill that you want, and it probably should be because it's so cool what you can do with it, you should take this class.</comment>This course isn't very inherently interesting. Learning how to use ArcMap is a super important skill for gov or social science concentrators. Lectures were pretty boring, though, and often didn't help at all with the labs. I pretty much had to teach myself how to use the software, and I'm happy I did. Don't buy the book. Sumeeta is super chill though, and a fun person to learn from.</comment>Super cool class. Some of the most technical stuff went over my head but it was really interesting to learn how to use ArcGIS for practical purposes or future thesis writing purposes. And Sumeeta is awesome.</comment>This is one of those "hidden gem" classes at Harvard! Certainly one of my favorite seminars, Gov 94dn is a fabulous course taught by an extremely knowledgeable and dedicated faculty member; I highly recommend it!! You learn theory of cartography and various tools for spatial analysis. Then, you carry out your newfound skills in weekly labs, using a software called ArcGIS. By the end, you're an expert in making your own maps and you walk away with a very tangible skill that you can apply in other academic fields, your thesis, or your career. Sumeeta, the instructor, is remarkably helpful and emphasizes learning over grades, even offering the option to resubmit any labs with corrections for full credit. She explains concepts in a very accessible way, stimulates good conversation, generates enthusiasm for the subject, and is extremely approachable/kind. Take this class! You will really enjoy it!</comment></course>HAA 18k: Introduction to Japanese Art</title>Overall an easy class-not a burden. McCormick is delightful and so is Steffani. Make sure you go to lecture because participating is great and one of the only ways to reinforce what I learnt; memorizing the names of artists & paintings is not simple.</comment>Professor McCormick is wonderful! The class is really enjoyable and manageable.</comment>I had never taken an art history course before, and this course opened my eyes. Melissa's lectures are accessible and inspiring. I would wake up some days feeling really depressed and low. I would trudge to Sackler for class and as soon as I sat down and Melissa started lecturing, I felt my worries fall away as I was swept away through the world of Japanese art. It taught me a new way of looking and being. I loved it!</comment>Professor McCormick and Steffani are AMAZING! They do their best to make time to meet or simply discuss art with you. Both have a genuine love for Japanese art that permeates the classroom and learning environment. As for workload, the scroll project is great fun, and the papers are not too bad. I highly recommend taking this course!!</comment>Such a fun and easy class, where you talk about incredibly interesting material! What more could you ask for? Professor McCormick is engaging and a total expert. She is a real person without the self-important professor air. I knew nothing about the history of Japanese art before and I found every lecture to be very very interesting, and I didn't really need to put much effort into it. You get to visit the MFA and the Fogg, do an art project, and there is just a short paper for a final, and I actually learned some stuff that I haven't immediately forgotten. Take it!</comment>Great course. You get exposed to a diverse cross section of Japanese art and architecture and you get to do some really awesome projects and interact with incredible pieces of art from the local museum.</comment>McCormick is an excellent lecturer. The section component of this class is very thorough. The assignments are incredibly interesting but the workload isn't too bad.</comment>If you're interested in Japanese art, than this class is definitely worthwhile. It covers a wide time span, so there's a lot of material, but it's really nice to be able to better understand the artworks. The assignments are really interesting as well, and there's 'hands-on' experience with culture in the form of a tea ceremony. Overall, I really enjoyed the class.</comment>This class is a wonderful introduction both to Japanese art and to the study of art history for anyone interested in either. Professor McCormick gives excellent lectures, and the course readings were really interesting.</comment>Professor McCormick and Steffani make this class very accessible, interesting, and are supportive of students. If you put time into it, they'll be enthusiastic about giving you help. The visit to the tearoom and the museum really connected material learned in class.</comment>Have fun! This class makes learning so enjoyable</comment>Prof. McCormick is really great. I enjoyed the lectures very very much. If only we had more time than 60 minute in each class. Also, the project prompt is AWESOME. I haven't enjoyed myself that much in completing coursework after getting into college. There are interesting and creative short assignments such as imaging our own teahouse which are also a delight to complete and to contemplate over. Seize the opportunity and take the course!</comment>This was a fantastic course. Prof McCormick is great and very accessible outside of class. She made a point of really getting to know all of the students in the class, which I thought was awesome. The assignments are fun and manageable, and there is never too much reading. One of my favorite HAA classes I've taken!</comment>This course was a fascinating introduction to the artistic traditions of eastern asia! Definitely take it!</comment></course>APMTH 101: Statistical Inference for Scientists and Engineers</title>First off, definitely ignore all of the Q Guide reviews of this class before this year - the professor has changed, and it is no longer the "easy stat requirement for engineers". I cannot emphasize this enough - this class is NOT an easy class. You will definitely be exposed to a variety of concepts, and by that I mean, it is like a fast-paced course in both Stat 110 and Stat 111, judging by the comments made by my stat peers as they looked at my AM 101 problem sets. This year, there was a no-collaboration policy, which means no pset-checking with your classmates to learn the material - so definitely take that into consideration as well when shopping this class. I feel like the teaching staff will be more organized and change the class a bit next time it's offered, so it will likely be better in coming years. So the only advice I have is to be wary of taking other hard classes (like physics and orgo) in conjunction with this class, as it will likely be more difficult and time-consuming than you think it will be.</comment>This course is very difficult - section is a must.</comment>If Tarokh is still teaching, do not take this course (Take ES150). It was the most unorganized and frustrating course I have taken at Harvard. Not only did the teaching staff expect everyone to remember random theorems from calc I and precalc, but they were condescending when we forgot something. And if we asked him to explain a concept, he would be quite rude about it, making it seem like we were a hassle to him. Also, they would randomly make things extra credit, or optional, which might sound good, but imagine spending hours and hours on a homework assignment, only to find out after you turn it in that they are now making it optional. Also, there was so much conflicting information between members of the teaching staff as to what would be on the exams, and what information we would be given. I have not taken a worse course at Harvard. Also, it was extremely frustrating, because statistics should be one of the most useful courses an engineer can have (particularly with regards to thesis data interpretation). However, I learned hardly anything that could be applied to actual data, as most of it was entirely theoretical, and thus NOT an APPLIED MATH course.</comment>The class was incredibly stressful. The no-collaboration policy on homework meant that it was hard to know if you were doing something wrong on the homework because you couldn't check with anyone else. The lectures were not very helpful in giving you the information you needed for the psets and tests. Everything was graded harshly but on a curve, so it was difficult to know how well you were doing in the class because it was all in comparison to how everyone else was doing.</comment>Prepare yourself for a lot of independent learning and a very unguided journey along this roller coaster. Everything in this class is unclear from what the subject matter truly entails to what the knowledge is necessary to complete the problems on an exam.</comment>Proceed with caution. The teaching staff did try to make up for some initial hardships so I will give them credit for recognizing midway through the course that change was needed. If these changes are retained next year then perhaps this course will start out on the right foot and be more reasonable. The instructors will recognize hard work, commitment to the class, and a genuine desire to learn and improve so I know they aren't heartless and were possibly overly zealous in the beginning stages of the course. They did try to rectify this as the semester continued but I would not take this course for Gen Ed purposes. Took it because I had to.</comment>A pretty ordinary Harvard statistics class that will give you many methods and tools to do statistical tests.</comment>DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. It is absolutely brutal. Every student absolutely despised this class and everything to do with it. The teaching staff mocked students when they didn't grasp a concept and assumed that everything was "easy" regardless of how many students contacted them. Student complaints were completely disregard and often taken as jokes. The class was overall the worst experience I have had so far at Harvard and I do not wish it upon anyone else.</comment>This course was a terrible experience. Between the disorganization, the unintelligibility of lectures, and the lack of communication about expectations, it was very difficult to learn the material. Manish, the head TF, is incredible and the only way I made it through this course was by attending his section and office hours. Unless absolutely necessary do not take this class--take Stat 110 if you actually want to learn the material, or Stat 104 if you simply need a stat class for a requirement.</comment>This class was by far the worst class I've taken at Harvard. Vahid is a very nice man, but he is a hopelessly bad teacher. The number of mistakes that were made every lecture were uncountable. It was a difficult course, but really it only seemed hard because we learned NOTHING in lecture. The concepts are actually quite straightforward, but the way the course was taught presented in a completely confusing way. The TFs were helpful, but it was hard to make up for the terrible lectures. When I was studying for the final exam, I had to completely teach myself a dozen concepts from scratch because (even though I attended nearly every lecture) I felt like I had never seen them before.</comment>The TF's attempted to put out the flames on this burning train wreck of a class, but it was beyond repair. Because few people understood much of anything and thus failed the midterms, Vahid curved the heck out of everything and added tons of bonus points, so everyone left with a satisfactory grade though not much understanding of statistics.</comment>This class is the worst class I have taken in my entire life.  The teaching staff was poor, the material was difficult and not taught well.  If you have the option to not take this class, please don't for your personal sanity.</comment>If Vahid is teaching this class stay away. He may be good for grad students, but he is too smart for undergrads.</comment>If Vahid Tarokh is teaching, take Stat 110 or ES150. Do NOT take this course. Long live Rob Howe.</comment>Don't take this class unless you have to. The teaching staff wasn't great except for the head TF Manish. For my major, this was one of two options to fulfill my stats requirement, and the other class had stat 110 as a prereq, so I had to take this. They don't let you work with anyone else on homeworks, you don't get anything out of lectures, and the only useful part of the course offerings is the section (which can be hit or miss depending on who is teaching). OH were generally useful, although it depending again on whose you went to. You better like AM 21a material, since this course heavily uses it.</comment>This course covers a wide variety of basica statistics and provides a great overview. However, as a result exams can be difficult to study for, since there is a wide breadth of material and the material often does not build on itself (ie. there are many separate topics covered in this course). Psets and exams are fair when compared to other engineering and applied math courses, though may take longer than you think. Section is helpful, but the textbook is not. I recommend reading the textbook examples and going to section / OH for help/</comment>not as easy as it used to be
be weary if you're just trying to get by</comment>Hard class because its not taught well. If you take it and you're struggling read the textbook (which sometimes had errors) and talk to vahid one-on-one- usually helpful then.</comment>This class is easy. Take it if you want to have an easy workload and have no desire to learn statistics. However, during exam times, you will need to do a bit of cramming.</comment>This class is definitely a challenge -- as it is currently taught, it is very tough to understand how to apply the material that is presented, or why a specific topic is taught at a given time within the course; you need a strong math background, at at least a calculus level, to be successful in the class</comment>So many feelings about this course: Never have I become more convinced that Harvard does not value teaching or its undergraduates. 

This was a highly disorganized class. Psets did not come back in a  timely manner (because they had one poor grad student grading all psets all the time. Because the people who were teaching us the material NEVER graded psets, they had no way to gauge how well we understood the concepts.) 

Vahid's lectures had nothing to do with the psets, so sections and office hours were the only way we learned the material. I spent a lot of time reading the textbook, watching Kahn Academy videos, googling, and reading lecture notes from stat courses at OTHER UNIVERSITIES!!

Kamyar was practically useless. Manish was our saving grace.</comment>Problem sets, while not necessarily difficult, are long and can take up most of your weekend, unless you are comfortable with submitting unfinished problem sets. Because there is a no collaboration policy on homeworks, you never know if you are doing the problems correctly and if you are stuck, you are on your own. The textbook is not the most straightforward read. Section notes and office hours are your best friends in this class.</comment>If the course remains the same, the workload and difficulty is close enough to stat 110 that you may as well take it. I don't see any other benefit in taking this course.</comment>I don't know if the course will be structured in the same way next year, but there were far too many whiney people. So what if the course changed completely from what the Q said last year? Professors are allowed to do whatever they want with a course that they are teaching. With that being said, lectures were not good, and most of my learning came from reading the textbook and going to Manish's office hours.</comment>This class is proof that the teacher makes the class. I would not suggest taking any classes with Vahid - he doesn't lecture on relevant material and derides students publicly when they don't understand the material.</comment>Do not take this course.</comment>Overall, this class isn't bad. Don't expect it to be easy, but you do learn a lot about probability and statistics. The exams and assignments are hard, but reasonable. If you are willing to put in the work, then you will find the course worthwhile.</comment>The problem of unreasonable psets is compounded by the expectation that there is no collaboration in the course. The exams are hard, and I don't think they are a reflection of what one has learned. There is little use in attending lecture. A lot of lecture is spent going over proofs that are completely unnecessary in helping you to solve problems, and this makes it unbearable. I stopped going after 5 lectures, and I think this actually helped my performance in the class by not wasting my time. That being said, Vahid, Manish and the rest of the teaching staff do care about their students, and do want to help. However, there were simply not enough office hours to reflect this. Office hours were generally early in the week, far in advance of the psets being due on Monday. Also, there was constant confusion of what was expected for us to know and what would be provided to us, in terms of formulas, on the exams. On top of this, because the first midterm was a bit ridiculous and not very reflective of knowledge learned up to that point, they added a second take-home midterm, which was also very difficult. Overall, it was quite the nightmare of a course. I wouldn't recommend it.</comment>I bet every comment says this, but there is a NO COLLABORATION policy in this course. Don't take this class unless you know that this policy has changed. Also, there were promises towards the beginning of the course that the p-sets would get significantly easier. The first p-set was accompanied with the guarantee "I know this is hard, but the next one will be easier." The same guarantee came with the second. And the third. But don't worry, if you hang in there it will get easier! The very last p-set was a breeze.</comment>Never have I been more disappointed in my Harvard education. The applied math department and SEAS generally should be ashamed that this class is offered as a requirement for so many degrees. This class was genuinely a disservice to the students that took it. All evaluations in this class were unreasonably difficult and did not at all correlate to the material learned in class. It's truly a sad state of affairs when a 6 minute youtube video can teach you more than 3 hours of lecture with this professor. This class was an enormous drain of my semester and it's truly a shame that I, like so many other students, was more or less forced to take it.</comment>It has some kinks to work out.</comment>Don't take this course as long as Vahid Tarokh is teaching it. It was a miserble experience. You're better off taking stat 110 and getting something out of it.</comment>I get the feeling the course will get a low Q score.  If it does, it doesn't deserve it. A lot of students (surprisingly, engineers) came in expecting the course to be Stat 104 due to previous years.  They got a rude awakening, but unfortunately were allowed to dictate the flow of the course because they complained a lot.  Their problems would have been resolved if they read the appropriate chapter in the very readable textbook (albeit typo-ridden) rather than complaining to the professor to make the course easier.

The course was exactly what an integrated statistics course should be without being as trivial as 104 and intense as 110 - it fit the right balance.  We spent time on the important distributions (not spending so much time on extra probability topics as the first half of 110) and then went right into parameter estimation, confidence intervals, and then regression.  Rather than 104 giving you tools with no theoretical context, and 110 giving you theory with even less context for application, am101 gives the derivation of the tool along with the use.  So, for example, you will learn how to do method of moments estimation and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), and then you will actually use those estimators in practice, while 110 would just move on, and you wouldn't really intuitively feel why MLE is sooooo important.

Vahid is an excellent lecturer (and also brilliant), very, very clearly wants his students to learn (he offered a ton of OH throughout the semester), Manish's section notes were invaluable, and Antonio was all-around awesome.</comment>Disorganized, unclear expectations. Prof. started by saying "This will be an easy class." Turned out to not be the case at all</comment>DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE IF VAHID TAROKH IS TEACHING IT. This class was by far the worst I've ever taken at Harvard and possibly the worst I've ever taken in my life. Vahid's lectures were filled with mistake after mistake after mistake because he would show up without any lecture notes and just wing every lecture. They were the most insane lectures I've ever seen and had everyone else in the class scratching their heads trying to figure out what was happening. The book was terrible too - most of the major equations had typos, and it was not written in a way for a beginner to understand. The lecture notes were just updated from last year's, so they had nothing to do with what Vahid had been rambling about in lecture, so they were pretty much useless as well. A lot of time was put into the section notes by the TFs, but they weren't great either, and it was sad that a summary of what we were supposed to have learned in lecture was all the students had to teach themselves from. Overall, this class was a terrible experience and is proof of how far SEAS has fallen. I hope Harvard puts in the effort to find out what went wrong with this class and restructures it for next year, but I don't really see that happening. A new professor will be a huge step in the right direction, so shop it if that's the case, but completely forget about the class if Vahid is teaching again. Stat 110 will be easier, and you'll leave actually knowing something.</comment></course>GOV 1010: Survey Research Methods</title>This is the most boring class I've taken at Harvard.</comment>The course is centered around an in-depth, interesting project, which was pretty cool to do. However, the lecture component is very dry.</comment>Survey methods is pretty intuitive, so honestly I dont feel that I learned very much. The professor and TF are both very sweet, but lecture is incredibly dull and pretty much everyone is just reading their email or on facebook. The project component of this class is it's saving grace, but I would not recommend this class.</comment>While it is not the most interesting course I have taken, it was an easier way to fulfill a concentration requirement for Statistics.</comment>It's very useful and well-designed, but it's not the most exciting class ever.</comment>GOV 1010 is a unique class in that you are able to learn about survey creation and implementation during lecture and then turn right around and try it for yourself. It is definitely important to have a good group, as you'll be working closely with them on most of the assignments. A great concentration course!</comment>DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. waste of a harvard semester. seriously -- not worth it at all. the material is really rudimentary & boring. professor tries, but is really frustrating. you get absolutely no valuable feedback along the way, and so your grades feel really arbitrary. i don't think i learned anything in this class that wasn't common sense that you probably should've known anyways. class turned into three hours of surfing the internet every week. STAY AWAY.</comment>This course is a very low time commitment, but the material is dry and lectures are not engaging. In addition, grading is very sporadic with little explanation. While it is an easy way to fulfill a requirement, be prepared for an uninteresting semester and probably not an A.</comment>Great, easy to manage course to learn about survey research methods. The project and final paper can take a bit of time.</comment>Lectures get a bit tedious but the material is valuable.</comment>Professor Harrison and Tess are great! Take it if you are interested in learning how surveys are conducted. You won't regret it!</comment>This course provides a great combination of overview and in-depth knowledge of survey and survey research topics.  I would highly recommend this course for anyone who may use surveys or survey research in their careers.</comment>Keep up with the vocabulary and you will do great.</comment></course>NEUROBIO 230: Visual Object Recognition</title>The class covers interesting topics in visual processing and give you an overview of the field. It also attempts to bridge the biological and computational side of the field. Unfortunately, this year the class did a poor job at doing either, not giving enough information for students of either background. Also the lectures and paper discussed seemed a bit disjointed because of the weird timing of reading the papers before learning important background information. I hope the class makes some major improvements for next year, but as it stands I would only recommend this class if you are dead set in going into this field</comment>This class is quite interesting if you have a proclivity for the subject. It's also low-stress, which is always nice.</comment>This is a very interesting course. The lectures sometimes move a little slowly, but the papers you will read are very good and the professors are great.</comment></course>VES 174: Art of the Real</title>Dennis is a fabulous teacher and is generous with his time.</comment></course>EAFM 140: Anime as Global Popular Culture</title>If you are at all interested in Anime and cannot seem to find another class that you are interested in to fill the AIU requirement, this is a great choice. Professor Yoda is engaging and insightful. The TFs are super nice and do care a lot about the class and students. There are some tough readings and a decent deal of work. The take-home exam is essentially a final paper as well. Overall still a great course!</comment>This class is engaging and presents relevant academic discussion about anime. You can take this as an elective course which covers Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding. I highly recommend it if you've ever found yourself interested in anime.</comment>It's a really fun class that allows you to discuss many social and cultural conditions (about Japan and anime) in-depth with a knowledgeable group of people.</comment>This class is really fun and has a wonderful environment! The subject material is fascinating and broadens your understanding of anime and Japanese culture. Definitely take this class if you like anime or Japanese culture in any way. Just be ready to read every week. It's not a lot, but it still takes some time.</comment>How often do you get a chance to take a class about anime? Professor Yoda gives well-organized and interesting lectures. You'll sample a broad selection of anime ranging from WWII propaganda animation to the key episodes of Neon Genesis Evangelion to surreal scenes of Daicon IV. The workload is rather light, but every assignment is engaging and fun! The CAs are very helpful, and give lots of feedback on the assignment. On top of it all, it satisfies a Gen Ed! Take this class!</comment>This class is really worthwhile to take. However, it is a lot of work. It is not an easy-A class, but if you put in effort into this class, you will get a lot out of it.</comment>Don't be afraid to take this if you haven't watched anime before.</comment>It's super interesting even if you don't know much about anime or Japanese culture!</comment>This class is a super fun and interesting perspective on anime as a historical genre.  You don't just learn about anime, but you learn about the impact the genre has had on everything from cinema, to marketing, to cultural history.  Take this class!</comment>The material is very interesting and our class was very engaged with the material which lead to great discussions and classes.</comment>Pretty easy class. Take it if you can write.</comment>Professor Yoda (yes, you get to have a professor named Yoda) is so awesome and cares deeply about the subject. She is able to make the lectures accessible to those new to anime while also making the discussions engaging for those who watch anime/read manga on a regular bases. The TFs are also really nice and give great feedback on essays.</comment>The coures is very interesting, but grading can be "random" or hard to understand.</comment>Have a basic understanding of animation before and make sure to do all the reading and attend all the screenings</comment>If you are interested in anime at all or if you want to learn more about an incredible medium, this course is for you.</comment>Telling people that you're taking Japanese Anime might be a little weird at first.</comment>Possibly my favorite class I've taken at Harvard. And I'm a senior.</comment>Material can get weird and if you are not into anime, then you can be an outcast in the class.</comment>Use the light work load to think deeply about the material, not an excuse to blow off the class</comment>This class is NOT light or easy, but in the best way possible. The material is brilliant, professor Yoda is brilliant, and you might be surprised what you learn about entertainment and about yourself!</comment>Course is not what you would expect. Be prepared to learn more about the culture behind anime and analyzing elements of animation.</comment>You might not enjoy this class if you are a realist.</comment>This class isn't going to be just watching anime.</comment>An interest in anime (obviously) and postmodern theory is a must.</comment>This was hands down the best course I've taken at Harvard, and I'm a physics concentrator. You'll see other comments that this course isn't "just watching TV," but I felt Prof. Yoda makes even the more dense scholarship (LaMarre) go down really easily. The readings were fascinating, you watch two hours of anime per week, and if you feel like procrastinating you have an excuse to watch anime "for class." The meta discussion on how anime producers and fans view themselves were also really fascinating and fun to learn about.
The essays were some of the easiest I've written because the material was simply enjoyable. The project was really fun if you wanted to put time into it and gelled with your group members (we got along well). I think if you didn't want to spend as much time it was still pretty much fine, I would not recommend that it deter you from the course.
I would also recommend that if you're interested and looking for a show to binge, watch Evangelion and/or Revolutionary Girl Utena (provided both are still on the syllabus). There's a weeklong unit on each and I thought it was really helpful to have seen at least some of the shows beforehand (definitely not necessary, but they're excellent shows anyway).
Great class, you watch anime always, super painless. Do it.</comment>Professor Yoda and the TFs are not only amazing, sweet people but also immensely knowledgable about the subject matter they teach. If you have absolutely any interest in anime at all, you're going to love the course! A good idea might be to get together a group of friends to split the readings up to make the longer ones more manageable, but if you take this class I can almost guarantee it to be one of the best (if not the best) in your schedule.</comment></course>SPANSH 35: Spanish for Latino Students</title>This is, without a doubt, one of my favorite classes during my time here. I've learned so much and it all seemed to happen so easily. We had a lot of say in what we did, and we learn a lot about each other. Parra is also just an amazing professor and being in a smaller class with her means a lot more attention. TAKE THIS COURSE</comment>This class is so wonderful! It accommodates people of varying levels and covers subjects very relevant to latino students. I also appreciated that the class adapted to its current students.</comment>I loved it. The professor is amazing and you get a lot of attention.</comment>I am a senior and I have never had a better teacher than Professor Parra. This class is the chance of a lifetime for any Latino/a student seeking to improve their Spanish regardless of their current level.</comment>This class has been one of the best experiences I have had here. The discussions were so engaging, and everyone is so invested in the course, which leads to really great dialogue. Profesora Parra is a wonderful teacher, bringing us resources and knowledge we weren't aware of, but also a great facilitator allowing for the class's conversation to be from the class. The topics, while very important to me personally, also very relevant on a larger academic basis, providing us with working knowledge and frameworks that can be applied to other classes and areas of study. It definitely brought in sociological, linguistic, and science based frameworks.</comment>If younger a native or heritage speaker of Spanish, take this class. This class explores both mechanics of the Spanish language and all Latin American cultures and societies.</comment>Professor Parra is absolutely amazing!  She cares about her students deeply.  I deeply enjoyed all the themes of the class as they allowed me to engage with the Spanish language while reflecting and being introduced to exciting texts and topics not covered or discussed in very few other places at the college. It's definitely a unique class; Parra provides students with the rare opportunity to learn while engaging with their identity and validating our experiences.</comment>Spanish 35 is the best class I have taken at Harvard quite honestly! Profesora Parra is such an amazing instructor because she not only has such a strong command on the language and the ability to locate your personal areas of development but is also warm and supportive. This course was a safe space for me especially since we discussed issues of latinidad, intersectionality, affirmative among others, which always were personal matters. The essays cover letter writing, reviews, creative descriptions, and academic writing and these are complemented by shorter reflection pieces. This class was challenging and relaxing at the same time and Parra worked to bring in movies and art (trip to the museum) to add nuance to our discussions and perspectives. If you can take this course, do it--it will be such a great learning experience. Parra is the best!</comment></course>MUSIC 160r: Composition: Proseminar</title>Recorded readings are amazing opportunities to "workshop" your music with professional Boston-area musicians. Private lessons are awesome. You can tell Marta and Dr. B both have a knack for teaching composition. They are also nice about letting you pick your own genre/form/etc.. Overall, one of the best experiences in the music dept I've had. It's one of those gem courses where you just get all these amazing things out of it and total freedom in what kind of work you do!</comment>This is a very enjoyable and rewarding course, and Professor Beaudoin is great to work with.</comment>You will get great feedbacks about your piece from your professor and TF, and also you can hear your pieces played by fabulous performers in Paine Hall, which was really amazing. Since it is a small class, students get along with each other really well to the extent where we had a bonding time outside of class.</comment>This course is what you make of it. Aside from the main projects (composing music for an instrumentation), the work load is near to nothing. NOTE: This does not mean the courseload overall was light. Personally, I invest much time into my music. Consequently, this was the course I worked the most on this semester.</comment>Great class. Beaudoin is the man. A bit too open-ended almost at certain points, but amazing class.</comment></course>EXPOS 20.282: Surveillance: Legal and Ethical Issues</title>The workload is a perfect balance - challenging but not heavy at all/very manageable. The subject is fascinating - the intersection between collection of metadata and the protection of people's privacy rights. I love how we cover both the technical aspects of the NSA's program but also the philosophical groundings of privacy in general.</comment>Interesting and useful subject material - a great way to do expos while actually learning something else important</comment>The thing about expos is that your experience in the class is going to largely be determined by your interest in the subject material. I was very interested in the topic, so I enjoyed this class. Others who may be less interested in analyzing the legality of surveillance may not find this course the best fit.</comment>Expos sucks, but as far as expos classes go, this one is pretty good. Interesting topic, although professor Sinnott is just okay. Overall, not that much work compared to other expos classes so I'd recommend it. Just wouldn't tell people to expect it to be your favorite class.</comment>lots of reading to do.</comment>Take this class if you are interested in modern surveillance laws.</comment>The class was great. It was Expos but with a nice twist. We read Supreme Court opinions, government reports on surveillance, and different evaluations about the modern state of surveillance. The time in class is also a great place to discuss the different opinions that can surge from the readings.</comment>If you're interested in the privacy debate and the controversy surrounding the NSA surveillance programs, then this is the course for you. If not, then you'll probably be bored with this course.</comment></course>LING 112: Syntactic Theory I</title>Be sure you understand the problem sets thoroughly.</comment>This class aims to give you an introduction to government and binding theory and how the basic concepts develop and play a role in modern generative grammar. It is extremely useful and intriguing.</comment>This course provides both the introduction to syntax and some further topics and questions related to it.</comment></course>FRSEMR 41k: Human Rights, Law and Advocacy</title>If you're interested in law, human rights, or if you just find this topic interesting you'll love this seminar. Sometimes the readings can be a bit dry but studying the same material Harvard Law students would be reading is really cool! Even if you think you already know a lot about human rights advocacy this seminar presents critiques of modern approaches and hypothetical solutions as well. This was definitely the most applicable and memorable classes of my freshman year.</comment>This is a great seminar that is really interesting but does not require a ton of work which is a nice way to ease into your freshman fall. Professor Farbstein is SO knowledgeable and it was really great getting to know her and learn about all of the incredible work she has done on all of these topics.</comment>It's good but the not the life-changing experience that the College says Freshmen Seminars can be. Susan is great, the material interesting enough and it's not difficult but it won't change your life. It will make you think more critically about the human rights campaigns you see all around you and international politics/bodies in general.</comment>This course isn't to give you a history lesson. Yes you will learn about issues and conflicts but it's not the main part of the course. If you take it make sure you want to learn about legal issues and ways to get involved. This is not the course where you learn how to be a grassroots organizer but you do learn techniques and best practices that you can apply later.</comment>Take this class! Susan Farbestein is an absolutely amazing professor and you'll love the course!</comment></course>APMTH 21a: Mathematical Methods in the Sciences</title>This course is incredible! Take it.</comment>This course is actually not hard at all if you do the psets diligently. The final exam is heavily weighted to the last third of the course, so study backwards for it (I didn't which hurt me).</comment>Overall, this class was quite more painless than it was made out to be. Of course, some of the material is fundamentally boring, but Margo actually does a pretty good job at keeping everyone engaged. I can't stress enough how much better the 1 pset a week vs 3 a week in Regular 21a is. I could usually crank out the entire Applied 21a pset in one night and not having to worry about another coming (even if they were shorter) was amazing. Also, I STRONGLY recommend that you take this class freshman year in you are placed into it. I waited a bit and regret it because I was a little rusty and out of practice. Tons of tips, tricks, and ways of thinking that I learned in high school math but had since forgotten would have been super helpful. Overall, I wouldnt recommend this class if you dont have to take it for your concentration but, if you do, it is far better than the Regular 21a alternative.</comment>This course is very helpful for many different concentrations and it really explains multivariable well, even to people who do not enjoy math very much.</comment>This is a great math course for those interested in the sciences and engineering. In classes like Math 21a, you may go slightly more in depth on certain specific topics, and you may learn about more of the theory behind the general concepts. However, in Applied Math 21a you really focus on the important things and you leave with a solid understanding of Calculus III.</comment>If you take this course, expect to learn all the material through the textbook. The lecturer isn't engaging. TFs aren't motivated (and they're college students). There is no application to any fields beyond mathematics so don't be fooled by the "applied" label.</comment>AM21a is a fantastic was to dive into multivariable calculus. Margo is especially a fantastic teacher, who explains well, is available outside class for help and advising, is really, really nice. If Margo is teaching again, take this class.</comment>Only take this class if you learn and absorb material extremely quickly. The lecture format of the class, as opposed to regular Math 21a, made it harder to stop and ask questions or ask Margo to go over something. Also, the weekly problem-sets, rather than a problem-set per class, actually made it easier to fall behind on this class. Someone who learns differently (faster and more intuitively) would have liked this class more, but personally I found myself having to teach myself everything from the textbook.</comment>Not very work intensive compared to regular 21a, well taught, and TF's are great. The optional sections are crucial to applying the material presented in lecture for problem sets. If you need to take the calc-III level, class, AM21a is the way to go for sure.</comment>Take math 21a.</comment>Fantastic math class. Some of the material is difficult. The tests will thoroughly challenge your mastery of the material. Nonetheless, I wholeheartedly recommend this class, especially for those considering normal 21a. If you are worried about getting the help you need in this class, or if you are worried about not having MQC, don't worry - the entire staff, including the professor, make themselves available very often - you will definitely be able to get the help you need. Margo is a fantastic professor. She is a truly unique Harvard professor. She genuinely cares about the performance of her students, and she is willing to sit down with you and discuss your performance. A great class!</comment>It takes work to get through it, but doable</comment>This class seems a lot better run and much easier than 21A if you are just looking to get a concentration requirement out of the way. Since the class has a rep of being easier people who aren't good at math take it so the curve is better.</comment>Really rewarding class. Well structured, well taught (if you can pay attention and learn well in lectures), and the textbook is well written and easy to follow. The last part of the class, chapter 13 and on, can get challenging and is explained less well. I chose to take this class over Math 21a and do not regret my decision. The applications and one p-set per week were certainly beneficial.</comment>The course was good overall. Margo is a great lecturer, and she really cares about her students. She is always accessible, and enjoys making sure that students succeed in her class. For those deciding between this course and Math 21a, I was took both. Math 21a is better for those who need constant assignments to do well (there is only 1 problem set due a week for AM 21a, while there are 3 shorter ones a week for Math 21a), but your experience in Math 21a is highly dependent on the TF. I personally chose AM 21a because I enjoyed Margo's style of teaching more than my TF's way of teaching in Math 21a. My roommate continued to take Math 21a, and I noticed that despite the difference in the way they're taught, the material in Math 21a and AM 21a is almost identical. Be sure to do practice outside of the one problem set a week, and be sure to take advantage of office hours to earn full points on the problem sets. Exams are overall very fair, although from personal experience and from what I've heard from others, there tends to be one exam that is much more difficult than the others. Overall, however, this is a very fair and good course!</comment>If you have to take it, it's a solid class. Otherwise, wouldn't really recommend as an elective.</comment>Take this course over regular Math 21a in all cases OTHER THAN if you want to be a pure math or physics concentrator. I took APMth 21a while my roommates took regular Math 21a and I saw them suffer through pointless nonsense. This course is taught better by better people in a better way. It focuses on the important things and leaves you with a genuine interest in exploring its potential applications.

*Be warned that a large portion of the class has already taken multi in high school and will thus be way ahead of you if you haven't. YOU WILL HAVE TO WORK HARDER THAN YOUR PEERS if you did not take multi in high school. Be ready for this and don't be discouraged. You can do amazingly in this course -- you'll just have to work for it.</comment>This class is very tough.  Be ready for hard tests and to feel very lost on said tests.  Lectures are helpful but a lot of the learning is left to the textbook.</comment>Kind of a self taught course as you have to put a lot more individual effort compared to regular 21a, but nevertheless I'm glad I took this class.</comment>The professor is great but it's difficult material and not so rewarding until the very end. Midterms are hard!</comment>Margo is a fantastic lecturer who is able to keep a room full of sleepy undergraduates entertained and excited about math. Enough said.</comment>This class is a very interactive class and teaches you about the many applications of multivariable calculus in the real world and implements huge equations into the real world.</comment>Stay on top of the psets and try to work them through on your own before checking your answers online/with friends, instead of just copying them. The questions on the midterms and final are harder  than the pset ones, so it's hard to do well on the tests if you don't have a really solid grasp of the core concepts. That said, Margo is wonderful and the TFs are all really good, there's a good curve, and because so many concentrations require it, you'll definitely be in class with friends. Overall, it's as enjoyable and interesting as an intro to multivariable calculus class is going to get.</comment>It's an interesting, useful course that I would recommend for others.</comment>Easy if you put in the time required, which shouldn't be too hard especially if you have a solid background in math.</comment>If you have to take a math, definitely take this one instead of Math 21a, I've heard a lot of people prefer Applied 21a. The structure is a little easier to handle, but you learn just as much. It's not easy, but the professor was amazing and the coursework was totally manageable.</comment>Definitely take this instead of Math 21a!

I'm an economics concentrator and was worried that I'd forgotten a lot of calculus since I took it in high school a few years ago, but it seemed to come right back, and the material is pretty straightforward and well-taught. There's no need for a class with homework due 3 days a week. Take AM21a!</comment>Despite being labeled as "applied" math, I saw very little real-life applications of this material. However, I still think the teaching staff makes this class worth taking.</comment>First, to address the Math 21a vs. Applied Math 21a debate: explore both options are choose which fits best for you. Both classes cover the same material at the same pace, but AM 21a has one problem set of 15 questions per week while standard 21a has three problem sets of 5 questions each per week. I chose AM 21a over standard 21a because of the structure of the homework because it fit best with my schedule. People may say AM 21a is the easier option, but I would not agree with this. Both courses are difficult. It's multivariable calculus, after all. Knowing that, be prepared to work hard and to study material outside of class in order to succeed on exams. Exams were fair for the most part, but the second midterm was a disappointment because complicated algebra for a few of the problems wound up causing a great deal of stress during the exam and led to many students underperforming. Problem sets were fair assessments, however the answers were easily locatable using the Internet, so it didn't seem like a real opportunity to learn. Professor Margo Levine is one of the nicest people I have met at Harvard and is truly enthusiastic about math. However, she is not a competent lecturer. She spent the first 20-25 minutes of every 53-minute class reviewing key concepts and material that had previously been covered in class, and reviewed, and reviewed again. This really cut into time learning new material, which was disappointing because much of the class had to be learned independently from the textbook. However, office hours made up for what lectures failed to deliver. The TFs were all undergraduates with plenty of multivariable calculus experience, so sections (which were optional) and office hours were very helpful to learning the material and solving problem set questions. Ultimately, I chose AM 21a because I had to take a math course for my concentration. I'm very pleased to be done with that requirement, though I am not necessarily pleased with my choice. It remains to be seen what the course will be curved to at the end of the semester, though there definitely will be a curve because the mean student fell at a B-/C+ going into the final exam, and that likely dropped. Good luck making your decision!</comment>This class is good if you like to have a knowledgable instructor who does a good job of providing examples and explaining things. The TF system is also a very good way to ground your concepts. However, be aware that the class is very large and it is difficult to ask questions during the class itself.</comment>It is a very good course that lets you learn multivariable calculus and actually apply some of your knowledge.</comment>If you want to take multivariable, this is a great way to do it.</comment>Word on the street is that this course is easier than Math 21a. It's certainly nice only having one pset a week, but sometimes learning in a large lecture format can be challenging and the usefulness of section varies widely depending on the TF.</comment>A good class to take for students who are able to reach understanding of course content independently.</comment>While lecture remains at the core of this class, section is invaluable to aid in the digestion of topics covered in lecture. If you decide to take this class, go to section.</comment>The exams are brutal, so make sure to study and take practice tests.</comment>Margo was unbelievable. I can't speak to how the class would've been without her, but on a personal level she's approachable, understanding, and wicked smart. The most important note to remember? Find a TF that works for you. Fast. Your assigned TF might not get the job done, and that's ok! Ask around, because James, Atticus, Emily and David were fantastic this semester, and there will always be options available.</comment>Go to sections, Office Hours!! It really makes a difference.</comment>Take this class!! Margo is a fantastic lecturer and a generally wonderful person, she does a great job of teaching you the material and is just a good person to get to know. The material can be tricky at times but it is always interesting and fun to work through so even when you get stuck on a problem, the experience is more challenging than frustrating. Office hours are fantastic : the majority of the TFs are nice people and will work with you until you understand the material, not just the solution to a specific question. Also, the community of students in this course is great and office hours were a nice time the work through psets and get to know people - I met some of my best friends in this class.  Another bonus: the workload is pretty chilled so this is a pretty low stress class - you can enjoy the experience of learning all the cool material without being distracted by stress about assignments.

In short: take this class - you won't regret it!! Definitely better than regular 21a!</comment>Take this instead of Math 21a! Margo is amazing and cares so much about her students. Psets are of reasonable difficulty and exams, in general, are fair.</comment>This class had some interesting material. I found that the lectures were helpful to integrate the many ideas in the class but there were a number of students who chose to use the textbook rather than attending class. The workload is manageable but you have to be willing to either stay on top of things throughout the week or be up late the night before each pset is due.</comment>Great and useful class.</comment>It's hard, but interesting</comment>Pros: 1 pset a week, section helps
Cons: lecture isn't the most enlightening, just introduces you to the topic for the most part; usually have to learn the material by yourself
The material is useful however</comment>For me personally, I wished I had taken Math 21a instead. Though there are less frequent psets in Applied Math, the material is basically the same. However, I think math is best learned through doing problems. Because regular math practice is not required for the course, you may find that you slack off initially, and become unable to move forward the rest of the course without having to play catchup to the material.</comment>I would highly recommend taking APM21a over Math 21a. Margo is a fantastic professor, clear, punctual, and incredibly helpful. Also, completing one longer pset per week instead of 3 shorter ones is definitely a big plus.</comment>Very complex towards the end and very cumulative, so make sure you understand material from the beginning and middle since it will be essential for the end.</comment>It's hard.</comment>This class has less of a workload than math 21a (1 pset vs 3/week), and its exams are not as long nor as tricky as math 21a's. However, the curve in this class is also not as generous, and a large portion of the kids in the class are overzealous Freshmen who have taken multi before. For someone who hasn't taken multi, this can be really discouraging and frustrating, because it creates an unequal playing field.
The good thing about this class is that Margo is extremely understanding and helpful, if you make the effort to talk to her. Make sure you go to her office hours, your TF's office hours (that's how I did my p-sets), section, and lecture, and make sure you set aside time to go through the textbook problems to really understand the material. As the syllabus says, you can do well in this class if you do enough practice problems. If you have the time/discipline, do that. If you don't, and you don't have a solid math background, I would seriously reconsider taking this course, and maybe take it after you've had time to review.</comment>It is good for learning multivariable calculus, and having one problem set a week makes the class not too stressful.</comment>Don't do the bare minimum and expect to get a lot out of this course. Put a bit in every few days.</comment>Lectures allow you to put as much effort as you may want, which can be a pro or con. If you're someone that can work well independently, then this is a better choice than regular 21a.</comment>The structure of the course is good for people who don't want to have psets continually due in 21a.</comment>The material is like in any other multi-variable calc course. This was the first semester Margo headed the course, and unfortunately the scores will fall. The midterms and final were beyond difficult--and they did not measure knowledge of the material. Margo kept saying that you can do better on the next exam, and then she made the next exam worse. I spent more hours studying for this class than any other in my life, aced the practice exams and homework, and then could not do problems on the exams. This class made me feel defeated. From what I have heard from friends in regular 21a, I would take that instead if I could do it over.</comment>I think this class manages to serve well both students who have already taken multivariable calculus in high school and want a refresher and those whose highest level math is BC Calculus (there were a lot of both and people in between in this class). I was in the latter category--and a little nervous because I'd taken time off between high school and college and had forgotten a lot of math--but I found that Dr. Levine was a clear enough lecturer that I could follow along for the most part, and assessments/psets are pretty fair. Definitely take advantage of office hours! Not sure if Dr. Levine is teaching this next year, but she and the TFs were all really helpful and patient and approachable.</comment>Margo may not be the best teacher, but she is really nice and she tries to be accessible.</comment>There is no calculus used the first few weeks of class.  It's a review of geometry.  I would not take this class if you are not interested in math though.</comment>It is much more convenient than regular 21a.</comment>That it is a hard and challenging Course, but it is so rewarding, and I feel like I actually learned something tangible and it helped me organize my mind.</comment>Easier than regular Math 21a. The course is easy at first, but really picks up towards the end. The last unit is hard, and the final is not easy. That being said, I'd take it over regular 21a. Just stay on top of your stuff. And GO TO SECTION. Section is so, so helpful.</comment>This is a great class. The material is extremely interesting, and the professor and teaching fellows are always willing to help whenever possible. I truly enjoyed this class and recommend it to anyone looking to take a multivariable math class. Make sure you continue to review the material throughout the semester to best prepare for the exams, and reviewing single variable calculus prior to taking the class would be beneficial.</comment>If you have to take it or are very interested in math then take it. If you don't have to then don't</comment>Do the homework in advance!</comment>Take it over the regular math 21a. Margo is dynamic and engaging, which makes the lectures much more interesting and worthwhile. I had an enjoyable time and many laughs.</comment>It is quite an interesting class that covers a range of topics. It is fun and engaging. It will help you learn math within the context of problems that are applicable.</comment>The problem sets are fine, but the midterms and finals were very challenging. Because of the way we rushed through the last chapter, I did not feel well prepared for the final.</comment>This class is well taught, but the final exam seemed excessively geared toward material learned only at the tail end of the course. If you take this class, be sure to take advantage of office hours.</comment>It's a good class that is a good alternative to 21a if you don't like having homework every other day.</comment>This is a course freshman commonly take. As a warning to freshmen, college level math is drastically different from high school level math. In college, you have to take it upon yourself to not only finish the problem sets with complete understanding, but also seek out other practice problems of your own. Some would even argue that the practice problems are crucial to solidify your understanding of the material before you tackle the problem sets. Midterms should not be taken lightly in this course either. Really ensure that you are comfortable with the material because it is often presented on exams in ways you are unfamiliar with. GO TO SECTION. Go to multiple sections! This is where you get most of the practice you need for problem sets.</comment>This course is fantastic. Please take it. You honestly won't regret it. It is math being taught in an enjoyable way--through a practical lens and with a great structure (Margo's lectures are outstanding, she helps make complex material accessible, and sections and TFs are generally great). Having one pset per week alleviates the stress as well, and also--for me at least--helps you understand material better as once you sit down to answer the 15 questions all in one time, you really understand all that is covered and know how to relate different problems and theorems/concepts. I really liked this course! Much more than I thought I would.</comment>I think Applied is the better of the two 21s, but still not easy. Margo isn't the best lecturer and going to class might not be your most effective use of time. Exams are NOT representative of what is taught in lecture/section, or what is on the psets.</comment>This class will challenge you thoroughly, expose you to many real-world applications of calculus, and push you to be a better mathematician.</comment>It's a good class and is well structured. The fact that there is only one problem set a week allows you to better manage your time. The lectures are clear and the concepts are explained well.</comment>I really enjoyed this class. While it was difficult, it was also extremely rewarding and the teaching staff was extremely accessible.</comment>Brush up on your calc before you take this class! Or at least have notes from your previous calc class on hand. Get your work done early, go to section, and go to office hours! If you can't make your TF's section or office hours, the other TFs and Margo are available and happy to help.</comment>Take this class if you're considering math or any other related field. It's a really great course that fulfills a prerequisite for nearly any math relative field you would want to pursue. Also take this over pure Math 21a, I know for a fact it's easier, covers the same material, and is more practical. Don't think, though, that you can walk in, walk out and get an A. You have to put in a lot of work to do well and understand the concepts. Also Chapter 13 is MUCH harder than the rest of the course so make sure you keep up to date with that as best you can, especially because it's the last chapter we did and everyone is sort of distracted by Thanksgiving/getting ready for exams.</comment>Lecture for this class is not the most helpful because the professor only has an hour per day. Utilize section and office hours as much as possible.</comment>Buy the textbook as soon as you enroll. Make sure to read it weekly.</comment>Requires outside work to understand concepts unless you can follow lectures that are very proof-based. Lecture and midterm material do not line up; lectures based on proofs but proofs are not included on midterms.</comment>Great class! Go to section!</comment>This was probably one of my favorite classes but I think it's in large part due to the way Margo taught it. She is extremely enthusiastic about the topic and uses a lot of visualizations to illustrate what we're learning. The visualizations make it much easier to follow what she's teaching. She also derives in class all the formulas you use so you really understand how it works.</comment>The material covered in this course is parallel to the material covered in regular Math 21a. I would recommend taking regular 21a if you are on the fence. The type of material taught in multivariable calculus is not so interesting to prompt much work outside of class and learning in a lecture format was not very productive for me. I think that most people would benefit from learning this material in small sections.</comment>If you work hard and seek help you can do well in the class.  I think a lot of people liked this better than regular 21a.</comment>This is a fairly painless way to knock out your math requirement. I didn't find the material particularly interesting, but the course staff are committed to making the class as engaging as possible, meaning that there are plenty of great resources.</comment>If you're debating between Math 21a and Applied Math 21a, easily pick this class. Yes, it's hard work you have to put in, and it can get intimidating at times, but the support network and teaching staff is so willing to help that it works out. It gives you, the student, flexibility in how you approach your learning - 1 pset a week versus 3 per week, and a guaranteed good professor teaching instead of potentially a subpar TF. And the TF's are very good in the class, and you have the option to go to section or not.</comment>Take this course. It is so much better than regular 21a. You can attend whichever section is more convenient for you, psets are due once a week instead of three times a week (which trust me you'll want), office hours are so frequent and available, and Margo is amazing (as are all the TFs). This course made me consider applied math as a future study and encouraged me to look into taking applied math 21b. It's definitely a bit of a challenge near the beginning (at least for me) because I was trying to figure out how this class worked and trying to understand basic multivariable calculus concepts. However, it is so worthwhile and so satisfying to do this course and realize you learned so much!</comment>Don't take it unless you have to. A substantial portion (if not most) of the kids in this class took multivariable in high school, so you will be competing with over-eager, over-qualified freshmen. Lecture does not prepare you for p-sets--you've got to go to section and actually open the book to complete them. Margo is really nice and willing to meet outside of the classroom, but it's really hard to make this stuff interesting. Either you see it or you don't.</comment>Assuming that you're deciding between this course and regular 21a, forget what other people tell you about each course. Think about what kind of environment YOU will perform better in. One p-set per week is nice, but in hindsight, I probably would have done better in the class if I was doing math more than once a week. Same with lectures. It's nice that you're not going to be called on in this class, but everyone understands math differently, so if you're an interactive learner, regular 21a is probably best for you. All this being said, Margo is a very nice professor, and this class certainly has perks of its own as well, so just know what style is best for you!</comment>FOR THOSE DECIDING BETWEEN MATH 21a AND APPLIED MATH 21a: take Applied. The caveat to that is: how good are you at teaching yourself things? If you enjoy having a flexible schedule, take applied. Lecture is not helpful but you can learn all you need from the textbook, meaning lecture isn't always necessary to attend. MORE IMPORTANTLY, you get 1 pset a week vs 3 per week in regular math 21a, meaning you can set aside 3 hours one day a week and that's the only math you'll have to do for the week, which some people really like. But don't take this if you need a good professor or struggle to teach yourself from a textbook, though the TFs can be helpful.</comment>This was a very difficult course. It is important to make sure you understand the material covered in every lecture, rather than trying to cram for an exam. You must study consistently throughout the year and understand every problem you are doing on your problem sets to avoid stress when exam time comes.</comment>This class isn't great but i think i would be better than regular math21a because it is much less theoretical.</comment>This class covered all of the topics that would be taught in a typical multivariable course and did so in a really approachable manner.  Professor Levine was great at showing where some of the concepts come from (she did a great derivation of the polar Jacobian and did a great job of developing the curvature equations, for example).  She was also very mindful of student needs; in the last unit, for example, she did a great job of summarizing all of the line integrals, surface integrals, and theorems related to curl and divergence in a way that helped me distinguish and relate them.  I especially liked the examples of how the concepts we learned could be applied to the real world.  It was nice to take a math course that showed how topics were related to tangible problems.</comment>Take this class if you are disciplined enough to self-study a lot of the material and can space-out work on the homework throughout the week.</comment>Take this course.</comment>If you want to go into engineering, you have to take the course.</comment>Don't take this class if you like feedback or asking questions. It's very impersonal and large; and can be very frustrating/disheartening if you are have any problems understanding the material. Take regular 21a - learning in small sections is always better!</comment>Margo is an amazing teacher!</comment>Great course! Margo and the teaching staff are exceptionally helpful!</comment>It is very difficult and you have to do a lot of studying on your own</comment>Review single variable calculus before taking the course</comment>Overall, it is a great course, and even if you are not interested in concentrating in math or a similar field, the material taught will be very interesting.</comment>Definitely go to lecture and make use of the TF's sections. The weeks I missed a lecture or two ended up being much more difficult with regards to the homework and preparing for the test. Margo is a fantastic lecturer and really explains ideas well.</comment>This class, in my opinion, is a better alternative to math21a and 19a if you are doing this simply for a concentration requirement and do not plan to move on to math21b. If you are planning to take 21b, I recommend taking 21a, not applied 21a. We do not go in depth about many of the math theories behind our work, which is great if you are stopping math at multivariable, but not great if you need to keep building upon 21a in 21b.</comment>It's a multivariable course that allows you more flexibility in your schedule.</comment>READ THE TEXTBOOK.</comment>Overall good class. Difficult class but needed for concentration requirement. I would recommend taking this class over regular Math21a. Margo is a great professor and really wants to see you succeed.</comment></course>FRSEMR 33k: Reasoning About God: Exploring Religious Belief in Light of Philosophy and Cognitive Science</title>Take this class. The professor is an amazing man. very enthusiastic, engaging, and genuinely in love with teaching the class. A great introduction to Freshman year, as the entire seminar tends to bond over a mutual affection for Guven and for the material itself which challenges personal beliefs while also fostering a genuine curiosity in the hereafter.</comment>The work is easy, so everyone does it, which makes class discussions far more interesting</comment>This is a great class with a generous course load</comment>A thought-provoking philosophy of religion course. I loved almost everything about this course: the class size, the discussions, the professor's insights and lesson plans, the readings, and the subject matter itself. It's such an intriguing topic, and it's made even better because Guven adds his own interest in AI and cognitive science into the regular philosophy material. He shows us fascinating videos and studies that change your perception about life and our existence as humans in general. I think everyone is naturally curious about these kinds of questions, but this is particularly satisfying for those with a burning desire to find out more about the existence of God, morality, life and death, etc. Take this course, you will not regret it.</comment>I would definitely recommend it if you wonder about the big questions of life, or even if you don't. I thought I had things pretty figured out but this class really exposes one to other opinions and ideas.</comment></course>FRSEMR 21v: Black Holes, String Theory and the Fundamental Laws of Nature</title>You learn an immense amount about modern physics, get to meet major figures in the field, and there are cookies!!</comment>If you're like I am and want to understand everything about the course you're taking, Freshman Seminar 21v may not be for you. We cover some pretty heavy material, from quantum mechanics to black holes to string theory itself. At first I read the chapters we were assigned in depth, furiously taking notes and attempting to make sense of what I had learned. However, this material frustrates even the greatest minds in science, and that is an important point to keep in mind while navigating this course. Essentially, take Freshman Seminar 21v at face value (as I learned to do). You will read about some history of the field and how it has progressed; you will learn a bit about scientific phenomenon (but not at a fundamental or deep level, simply because concepts become too complex); and you will almost certainly enjoy the Insomnia Cookies at class every week. But if, like me, you want a seminar experience that will force you to think critically about a topic, engage with your peers (and professor) in discussion and/or debate, and change the way you think about something, Freshman Seminar 21v may not be for you. That said, I did enjoy my time in the course. Professor Strominger is incredibly generous, and Alex (our TF) rocks. Professor Strominger is beyond brilliant, and I would suggest you take advantage and go to Office Hours, to ask about physics or just to chat. Freshman seminars are unbelievable opportunities to get to know world-renowned staff, so don't pass that up!</comment>Take this class. If you are at all interested in cool modern physics (black holes, string theory, etc.), you will love it. Andy is an amazing professor and it is very clear that he loves teaching freshmen and cares very much about his students. We had dinner with him several times throughout the semester, a couple of times at his apartment. We got to meet amazing physicists (including Andy!), and Steven Weinberg (nobel prize laureate) visited with our class when he came to campus for a public lecture. Andy even took the class out to see Interstellar and then dinner in Chinatown. The experience of this class is every bit as amazing as the material covered. I returned from class every Tuesday energized and inspired by the amazing world of physics. I always looked forward to going to this class - it was a highlight of my week. I cannot overstate how great this class is. It is a wonderful experience for freshman fall, especially to spend time with a professor who cares as much as Andy. This class is the kind of thing that makes Harvard so amazing - take advantage of it!</comment>This class is simply the best. Modern physics is a daunting subject, but this class makes it easy to understand in a qualitative sense. Professor Strominger and his grad student Alex are some of the best people that you will ever meet. Some of the reading can be heavy (but not long) but it is ever so worth it. As a potential physics concentrator, I particularly appreciated this course, but anyone with even the vaguest interest in modern physics will enjoy this course immensely. Workload is light, with weekly reading and a single paper due at the end of the course. After taking this course, I fear that no other may be able to match it. I cannot recommend this course enough.</comment>The best class you will ever take. Seriously. Cookies, food, mind-bending physics and the most amazing professor of all time - there's nothing better.</comment>Andy makes this class.  I love him.  I wish he was my grandpa.</comment>This course is great way to engage with the theoretical physics questions today with one of the great pioneers in the field of string theory!  Every class we were treated to cookies and milk in a very warm discussion based class environment.   If you really want to grapple with equations or lab work, this course is probably not the best, but if you are the kind of person who enjoys specials about the cosmos on the Discovery Channel, this class would be for you!</comment>There are cookies.</comment>Professor Strominger and the TF Alex are awesome. Definitely take this class.</comment>its a really fun class. you learn a lot about a field that for most of us would be pretty inaccessible</comment>This course is mostly consisted of self-reading and Q&A in class. if you are a person who prefers professors teaching and instructing a lot, this course may not be perfect for you. However, the professor is extremely accessible and nice, so if you don't mind lots of readings and like to explore this very awesome topic, feel free to try!</comment>We like to call this course "Black Holes and Cookies" 
Best class ever. You will learn so much and eat so many cookies. It was also really cool when Professor Strominger, we called him Andy, brought us over to his house for discussions and food. Little did we know going into the class how INCREDIBLE Andy is. He was mentioned in all of our readings and is published in some very important research.</comment></course>ENGLISH 102h: Introduction to Old English: The Literature of Spiritual Warfare</title>A very good introduction to Old English taught at a responsible pace</comment>This is a very interesting class that introduces Old English in a manner that is very accessible to most students. I certainly recommend it, though, be warned that you will not necessarily walk out knowing much Old English. The focus is primarily grammar and the onus of learning vocabulary is placed upon the student. Also, although the topics of the course are not particularly challenging, the class can require a large time commitment as translations could take a very long time as I did not know many words without consulting a glossary.</comment>This is a course one should definitely take if one is interested in Old English literature and culture, or at least in English literature. Taking it just to fulfill a foreign language requirement may prove frustrating, as it's not usable outside academia. The class will require a steady weekly, even daily, input of effort, which one must be prepared to provide.</comment>This class is taught directly to those students that have a background in Latin or even concentrate in Linguistics (and if you did, you'll think this course is very easy, i.e. the Q score). If this doesn't apply to you, you could very well get swallowed whole by this course. Translations take hours as you have to look every word up in the back of the book. It was the first rendition of the course and Professor Wang consistently stresses that this is a work in progress, but bear in mind, this might just be more than you bargained for.</comment>This class is a fun, fairly painless way to get your English Foreign Literature requirement out of the way. The workload is manageable if you're smart with your time, as the translations of the Old English texts may take a little while. There is a quiz every so often, and if you study well you will do fine. Laura is a very kind and helpful professor, and is extremely approachable outside of class if you need extra help. Erica and Porter are also great as TFs, offering help and also just interesting facts and tidbits about Old English culture and literature in section.</comment>Prof Wang is really amazing and she made the class fun. Readings were actually very interesting, but the final was difficult.</comment>This class is great! It's a ton of fun and it's not hard and it fulfills the language requirement. Just take it already!</comment>If you are interested in dead languages, go for it! It is interesting to see where our own words and grammar come from. However, the nature of translating can be tedious, and very time-consuming. Laura and both TF's this year are very enthusiastic, though, and always willing to give as much help/make things as interesting as possible.</comment>It is well-staffed and fun if you enjoy learning languages</comment>I liked this course!  It didn't blow me away, but the teaching staff was great and the material was very interesting.</comment>Fun class! Experience with other inflected languages (e.g. Latin, Greek etc.) helps, but is certainly not necessary. The workload is very manageable and the texts are interesting.</comment>If you're looking for a relatively painless way to satisfy the foreign language requirement for english concentrators, take this.</comment>If they are interested in the history of English literature and language or in Anglo-Saxon culture, I would strongly recommend it, with the provision that a large portion of the course is spent getting ready to read Old English--you don't just dive in.</comment></course>KORHIST 253: Modern Korean History: Proseminar</title>It's probably better to have taken some kind of Korean, or at least Japanese history class.</comment>This course is great at laying out not the history of modern Korea, but also give a good understanding of historiography. The books are well chosen and offer an opportunity to read new publications.</comment>A rite a passage for modern East Asianists.</comment>It's worth doing some preparation for the debates, they were usually quite fun and interesting.</comment></course>ENGLISH 190we: David Foster Wallace</title>If you like David Foster Wallace's writing and are willing to read a lot of it, I highly recommend the class. I always enjoyed heading to lecture to hear Andrew's take on the texts and being able to talk about Infinite Jest in sections adds so much to the experience.</comment>It's a huge amount of reading (upwards of 10 lbs., as Prof Warren likes to say) and a fair amount of writing, but this course was pretty excellent - mostly because it's hard to mess up David Foster Wallace. They do an impressively good job of balancing discussion and lecture formats, since the course has way outgrown a pure discussion structure. Watch out for the final: they barely mentioned it all semester and then suddenly we had a three-hour take-home final with a two-day prep period and some really crazy complex and in-depth questions that we were supposed to answer within a VERY short writing time. Apart from that, though, I really enjoyed this class.</comment>This course is fantastic, but I would only recommend taking it if you are already interested in the work of David Foster Wallace. This is not a David Foster Wallace primer; in order to take this course, you should be willing to throw yourself entirely into his work. If you don't like Wallace's writing, this course will be a nightmare.</comment>I expected to like this course, but ended up hating it because it was an entire semester spent on one author who I didn't like nearly as much as I thought I would. Read at least a hundred pages or so of Infinite Jest in advance to see if it's something you would want to read 1200 pages of. David Foster Wallace's essays are great, but I found his fiction to be a drag and ended up loathing the massive amounts of reading I was assigned. Make sure if you take this class that you love him and are willing to devote an entire semester to his work.</comment>Prepare to delve into the expansive, funny, and palpably sad mind of one of the greatest writers to appear on the American literary scene in the past twenty years.</comment>This class was fantastic. It's certainly an intense workload, but getting to study an author at this in-depth of a level is a singular experience. Professor Warren cares so much about the material and puts so much time into the course. Section was also great with Stephanie.</comment>David Foster Wallace wrote in very cool ways about extremely relevant ideas. I think it's worth reading him, and doing so in a course is a great choice I think (especially for a literature novice) since there's a lot going on in his work. Maybe be willing to think about life and get depressed a bit though.</comment>The pacing of the reading can be a little difficult at times but it is a great course.</comment>Wallace's work is awesome. It's an insane amount of reading but you can get away with not doing all of it- although I really wanted to, I just had trouble actually getting it done despite my best efforts. It's worth trying, because there are a lot of profound and exciting moments in Wallace's work. I definitely feel like I'm a slightly different person having engaged with his work, which I can't say about a lot of authors. If you give yourself a sense of how long you have to read a given text and how many days you have to do it and actually stick to the amount of pages you need to read each day you might get through it all, instead of just spacing out and thinking about it a couple days before you are supposed to finish. Sack up and take it, you won't regret exposing yourself to Wallace.</comment>Beware: this class is incredibly enlightening but disturbing. You won't be able to forget some of the concepts when you're walking around trying to live your life.  If you want to remain ignorant and happy I wouldn't recommend. But if you like complexity you'll love it.</comment>Professor Warren is excited to teach this class, and it shows. The lectures - inside and outside the classroom - are interesting and novel. The coursework itself is, of course, amazing. Just be careful of the gigantic workload.</comment>This classed kicked my ass, but it was amazing.  I've been telling people that after I took the class, I realized that I do not really like DFW, but I would take this class again and read all of his work in a heartbeat.</comment>Take this class! DFW had an intriguing path to when he "Broke the internet." Professor Warren is very enthusiastic about the subject and is extremely knowledgable and accessible. The assignments are interesting, the reading entertaining. It is intense, but worth it.</comment>If you have any interest whatsoever in DFW, definitely take the class. As you'd expect, the readings are long, but if you do your best to keep up, you'll get so much out of the course. By far, one of my favorite classes I've taken at Harvard.</comment>Make sure you like DFW BEFORE you register for this course. If not you might get stuck in the middle and realize you can't stand him. However, Even though I emerged a less than big fan of his, I still feel like I got a lot out of the course from professor Warren. The lectures were broad and engaging and I learned so much about what it means to write fiction and contemporary literature as a whole.</comment>This is an awesome course if you want a full overview of DFW's work, but it is also a ton of reading and a lot of little assignments that are easy to get bogged down in. Professor Warren and Will are great and super supportive, but it was definitely not just an easy English class to take for fun. Take it if you're interested in reading and learning more about DFW and want to think about some really huge topics like life, death, happiness, consumerism, love, time, and irony.</comment>I loved DFW before I took the class, or, at least, I thought I did. But now I know what it truly is to love DFW. I can think of few better recent authors to spend an entire class on. TAKE THIS CLASS</comment>AMAZING readings. Even if your not a Wallace fan, this course will shake your existential foundations. Besides reading a very good and whole chunk of Wallace's work, this course took great pains to include amazing side readings that stemmed from influences such as Joyce and Pynchon, all the way to philosophy, film, psycho-analysis, etc. There was a massive bulk of readings for this course, but overall they worked well together and were insanely though provoking. IF you want a course that will answer the tough question of why Wallace has become such a literary phenomenon/cult, this is a great course to take. Think of it not only as a English course but also as a philosophy/film/social studies course. Do your self a favor and take this course. (it will also probably be fine tuned the next time around.)</comment>This class was so good, it made me reconsider my choice of major, as a senior. DFW is a must-read for any modern reader who thinks about the major life questions all hungry readers think about. Warren is a gem, and is extremely accessible. His wealth of knowledge about DFW is probably only rivaled by Wallace's biographer.</comment>If you want to appreciate this course, choose your semester's classes such that you are able to do all of the readings. Wallace is an incredible writer, and Professor Warren approaches the readings with good insights as well as a fun attitude.</comment>I really enjoyed this course, though I have a couple of important reservations. 

On the one hand, DFW is absolutely brilliant. The syllabus--both the Wallace texts and the accompanying works--is filled to the brim with absolutely marvelous works. If I had read them all fully I would be very proud of myself indeed. Lectures provided nice guidance towards understanding the material, and section provided excellent discussion time. Talking about the material with other students was very fruitful, and I definitely learned a massive amount from this course. Oh, and Prof Warren and Will were amazing. Prof Warren is super enthusiastic and knowledgeable and very accessible in office hours, while Will, who is like a walking compendium of theory, guided discussions with authority and verve.

On the other hand, DFW grates on you if you read too much of him in a short amount of time. I would keep getting to the point where I thought, falsely, that all his writing was just intellectual games and not want to read any more. I think in general people didn't do all of the reading, and if they did all of the reading they didn't do it particularly thoroughly, and that would occasionally show in section/personal discussions. I also thought that lectures were occasionally too wispy, focusing more on providing outlines and frameworks rather than clear-cut answers. I could very well be wrong about this--it's probably good to shy away from making super definitive statements for someone as interpretable as Wallace--but I felt lost at times and would've appreciated more concrete guidance.

I guess overall this was a very very good course that fell just short of amazing. I would guess that some of that is because it just transitioned from a seminar to lecture format; I imagine these issues will be less noticeable in the next iteration. I would absolutely recommend taking this course (I got a ton out of it) but would suggest being aware of the above issues.

Oh, and maybe read a bunch of the texts beforehand. I would've gotten so much more from this course if I had done that. As is it was simply infeasible for me to read the entire syllabus, and even if I had done so, it likely would've been at the expense of depth.</comment>This is the first time the course was offered as a lecture class, so at times it felt like it was still fleshing out its identity, but overall it was a great class at the intersection of literature, philosophy, and art. Try to keep up with the readings, especially Infinite Jest, and also try not to be burned out at the end to the point in which you cannot read the last few Wallace works (because they do matter!). Whether or not you're a fan of Wallace (some of his work can be sexist, others can be a bit offensive to minorities), you'll learn a lot about how to think about literature and the relationships between the writer and reader.</comment>There is SO much reading; this is definitely not a class that you can blow off week-to-week. That being said, DFW is arguably the voice of a generation of American writers, and doing such an intensive examination of his career is fascinating. His voice is so perceptive and unique--I could really go on and on, but basically the reading is totally worth it.</comment>Take this class. Warren's a terrific lecturer who encourages you to figure out what's important to you about each text. (Go to his office hours!) Wallace is a titanic figure and so can be difficult to know how to approach--this class offers a multitude of perspectives (literary, philosophical, meta, meta-meta, etc.) from which to glimpse something of yourself in his writing. Because if you take this class and allow yourself to really get into it, you'll walk away with more than just an interesting English course--it'll lowkey change your life. It's a little eerie, in fact, how much of what's going on in Wallace's literary landscape echoes the experience of a young college student trying to figure out plans and trajectory. There's a ton of reading but you'll do fine gradewise without doing all (or even close to all) of it. However, if you're anything like me you'll feel bad because it's good writing and you'll want to soak it all up.</comment>There's a LOT of reading but if you're gonna take this class, you're the kind of kid who's ready for that. Warren is hilarious and compelling as a lecturer and it's so hard not to get excited, in class and in section. This class just makes you feel good about reading.</comment>This class is one of the best classes I've taken at Harvard. If the purpose of a liberal arts education is to expose you to the sorts of things that are relevant for the world, this class serves that function. It produces smart, thoughtful, and culturally aware human beings. It was hard work but worth it!</comment></course>AFRAMER 90r.i: Igbo</title>it is a great experience</comment>It is a great class environment with very few students in your class and an authentic Igbo teacher who lives the culture.</comment>The course is a very good way to become immersed in a culture removed from the Harvard bubble which so often traps us in a specific, closed way of thinking.</comment>If you want to learn about a very interesting culture of Africa, this is the way to go.</comment>Good course!</comment>Class works great for an elective or a language, Professor Onaga is great.</comment></course>GOV 94nl: Election Polling and Public Opinion</title>This seminar is a great overview of political survey research from many different angles. Prof. Harrison works very hard to make sure that everyone gets the chance to focus on the topic they're most interested in, not just with the final paper, but also by changing assigned readings, letting students dictate the flow of discussion, and being accessible to talk about any topic.</comment>Professor Harrision is very kind, thoughtful, and helpful; he's a great professor to work with in a small setting and he is very knowledgable and experienced in the course material. He will help you to succeed even if you don't have an adequate background of some of the material, but I would say that in order to get the most out of this class for yourself, take it if you know you have a more comprehensive understanding of statistical analysis beyond an introductory stats course.</comment>Take this course! You will come out of it with skills that will help you in the rest of your social science courses. Professor Harrison is really great, and he really cares about his students. He was always willing to meet with me anytime and when we met he gave me really insightful comments that helped me with my assignments. He is really enthusiastic about this material, and you could feel that throughout the entire semester.</comment></course>PHYSICS 15b: Introductory Electromagnetism</title>This is a very challenging class, but if you are interested in physics you have to take it. The best piece of advice I could give would be to find a good study group for the problem sets - working together will get you through the course. The exams were quite difficult.</comment>Your experience in 15a is not a predictor of your experience in 15b. I hated 15a but loved 15b. The material is fascinating. It's harder/more abstract than mechanics but it's also much more interesting. The concepts are truly amazing and Maxwell's Equations are BEAUTIFUL! Professor Kim and Nick are also awesome! Professor Kim is so down to earth and makes really funny jokes and I really enjoyed going to class. His lectures are clear (it may not so at first, but that is because E&M as a subject requires multiple looks; it's not a subject you can expect to learn at first sight. This is also the first class at Harvard where I decide to read the textbook, which is really helpful.) Nick is the best TF I have had at Harvard. He cares so much about the class, is very good at EM and at explaining the concepts, and very accessible outside of class and dedicated (a week straight of office hours before the final). With that said, the material is hard and you will have to work hard to learn the material, but chances are you will be surrounded by people that genuinely care about physics, which is magical.</comment>If you're reading this, then odds are you just have to take this class, so here's my advice: taking it off-sequence is a good move. The class is much smaller and you won't be stuck with as many Physics 16 students accelerating the class to an unreasonable pace. However, do not take it if Philip Kim is teaching it. I could honestly fill several pages with descriptions of his faults as an educator, from seemingly minor things like constantly standing in front of the board so you can't see what he's writing (seems minor the first day; it'll be a lot more frustrating three months in) to more serious things like his complete unavailability outside of class and inability to structure problem sets and exams in ways that are suitable to what has been taught (there were problem sets--plural--that contained material that was not taught until after they were due). Better to suck it up and take it in the Spring if you can get Morin or another competent professor than take it off sequence with KJP.</comment>This class is very difficult and time-consuming, but it is so rewarding. The teaching staff was incredible and the camaraderie between the students made it easier to get through. The material is inherently SO interesting, and you'll find yourself marvelling at a lot of the conclusions that are made in class. Through the lab component of the course, you will walk away with a lot of solid practical knowledge about everything from AC and DC current, transformers, etc, to how things like high and low frequency filters (all about that bass?) and dimmer switches actually work. Just an awesome class! Definitely take it if you are interested in physics!</comment>Prepare to block off a lot of time for office hours if you want to not fail the problem sets</comment>Philip Kim is a great lecturer. Psets are relatively hard, but definitely doable and rewarding. You will have many epiphanies throughout the course, starting with the relativistic development of magnetism, through Maxwell's equations and the discovery of electromagnetic waves.</comment>It is fun.</comment>Surely the experience is highly dependent on the teacher. I found Prof. Kim (and also Prof. Prentiss, though we spent less time with her) very solid in presentation of topics, not leaving many loopholes or open ends. In fact, I have not found as strong a pedagogue in our Physics department, and I think that he will prove a very good addition in terms of enhancing our teaching.</comment>Over time, as Professor Kim gains more experience with the course and writes more practice questions/adjusts the exams, the course will greatly improve in quality. As it stands, Professor Kim is a great instructor who really is interested in fostering student understanding of the content.</comment>This class was a stressful experience. I did not get much out of this, except limping from midterm to midterm, and the exams were so chaotic it was impossible to have any idea of our performance. Only take this if you have to or you really REALLY want to, else you will leave exhausted and frustrated.</comment>Professor Kim is very passionate about physics and is a good lecturer, but there are not many practice problems to practice with- his questions are very different from the textbook questions and he only provides one practice exam, unlike when Morin taught it, when all possible exams for seven years were available.</comment>I think this class is very good and I'm amazed by how much I learned about electromagnetism. This being the first year Physics 15b was taught by Philip Kim, I could definitely see some bumps during the semester. In particular, we fell behind on our schedule and then got rushed through a lot of material at the end. However, I believe that will be improved upon in future semesters. Also, the midterms and final were definitely all over the board. The first midterm was extremely difficult, but the second midterm was extremely easy. The final returned to being extremely difficult. However, despite rough patches in the class, I'm very glad I took it and would recommend it to anyone else.</comment>Prof. Kim is an awesome teacher! This class was a lot of fun and the lab component is not too bad.</comment>Physics 15b is a great class!  Professor Kim is an excellent professor, and I would recommend highly taking the course when he is teaching it.</comment>This is a fair physics class. Professsor Kim was a very good lecturer, but was not so accessible outside of class. The TF Nick Langelier was fantastic; he really took the brunt of student questions and taught a ton in section and in office hours. Props to him. Final was brutal, though.</comment>Good class, but difficult.</comment></course>EXPOS 20.131: Philosophy of the State</title>I would recommend this class, the material is very interesting and you will learn more about the English language and strategic writing than you would ever expect. Owen Chen truly cares about his students and will help you become a better writer. If you take this class, the way you read academic books and arguments will be transformed. However, be careful because there are a lot of dense philosophical readings in this course. A lot. While this class will require more effort than other Expos classes, you will get A LOT out of it (dare I say more than any other expos class?). Take this class if you are up for a challenge and if the topics interest you! The topics were super interesting to me and they changed my outlook on how I view certain issues and ideas.</comment>The preceptor gives good feedback.</comment>Make sure that you are interested in the material. It's hard to write about material that you have very little opinion on or feel is out of your range of knowledge.</comment>- perhaps a bit intimidating, this is an enjoyable and rewarding course</comment>If you are interested in political philosophy this would be a good intro class to gov or philosophy classes. Even if you have prior experience or familiarity with the course material this will likely expand your perspective. A lot of discussion about ideal vs reality as it applies to states, anarchism, human nature, etc..</comment>Besides the great readings and interesting subject, Professor Chen is one of the most engaging, educated, and caring teachers you will likely meet at Harvard.</comment>be prepared to read a lot. if you like obscure gender lessons from a long time ago... Do not expect much discussion about the state.</comment>It's a great class with good reads, but it is dense.</comment>Everyone needs to take expos. If you have some interest in political philosophy, then you're in luck, because odds are, you'll get this course almost for sure if you put it as your top choice for the lottery. The reading material may be bland if you don't like the topics, otherwise the class can be quite enjoyable. Dr. Chen is extremely knowledgeable in the class material and facilitates great in-class discussions. He provides exceptional feedback in the form of written comments and one-on-one conferences. You'll definitely learn a lot about writing and about political philosophy. The drawback is, don't expect this to be an actual philosophy class. Those of you who were put into this class against your will can rest assured that it is still primarily about writing, same as any other expos class.</comment>This course is definitely the hardest of the expos classes. The readings are numerous and difficult to comprehend fully. I didn't take that as seriously when signing up for the course as I should. The course is rewarding, because it forces you to really think critically and understand the material. Do not take this course if you aren't willing to work really hard and if you do not have an interest in political philosophy specifically.</comment></course>WOMGEN 98f: Tutorial - Junior Year: Research and Methods</title>The class requires a large amount of individual self-discipline and preparation, as well as a commitment to your research topic. Our assignments were not given with much detail, but I appreciated the flexibility of the teaching staff, and their willingness to see my project develop as I had envisioned it.</comment>Obviously if you are going to write a WGS thesis, you need to take this class. But be careful about your selection of a tutor. You will work closely with them and if their style does not fit very well with yours, it may be hard to feel good about the course. Especially if you are taking the course off-cycle, I would recommend meeting with your tutor and with the head professor beforehand to get a feel for what they are like and what the class will be like, since you will have fewer (if any) student classmates to share the experience with. Also communicate early about how you are feeling and what you need in the course in terms of support, because it becomes very difficult to ask for it later. The heads of the department are also great resources for support in this class. All of that said, it provides a great opportunity to study something you are passionate about and to figure out whether or not you really want to write a thesis.</comment></course>FRSEMR 25w: Responsibility, the Brain, and Behavior</title>The class covers a lot of material and you'll learn a lot, but be prepared for lots of readings, some of which are really dry.</comment>This class was by far my favorite class this semester, and I have a feeling it will be one of my favorite classes at Harvard. The workload is very manageable and the readings and discussions are incredibly interesting. It's a really unique class that also involves a trip to the Bridgewater State Mental Hospital/Prison, which was really fascinating. Couldn't recommend it more!</comment>This class is fun with a larger workload. However, much time is given for the assignments.</comment>Really cool subject matter and low workload</comment>It was a spectacular course run by Dr. Schouten. Minimal workload, an extremely interesting topic, a great professor, and a small atmosphere makes it a spectacular seminar and an amazing experience.</comment>Definitely take this class if you are interested in law, psychology, mental health, or criminal justice. It's not a difficult class, but it is highly interesting and it is a nice change of pace from big lecture classes.</comment>Great class, great teaching, a good deal of reading, but always there for you to truly learn, rather than for a specific grade.</comment>Do the readings to get the most out of this class</comment></course>TWI B: Intermediate Twi</title>Take the class! It's a very chill course but you do learn a lot of vocabulary.</comment></course>AESTH&INTP 11: Poetry Without Borders</title>If you sincerely care about contemporary international poetry, you will not regret this class. You have so much flexibility to explore the parts of poetry that matter to you AND learn about poets you would have otherwise never heard of. Although this is a Gen Ed, it will not be fun unless you truly enjoy poetry. The workload in this class is what you make out of it. The required readings are not that many, but there is a lot of supplementary poetry. At the end of the semester, you compile a portfolio with your own work and analysis, which is BY FAR one of the best assignments I have had during my time at Harvard.</comment>This class is awesome. Definitely take it if you have any interest whatsoever in poetry. Stephanie and Maria (TF) are both super accessible and enthusiastic. It's not a huge amount of work (but also not a class you can just blow off), and all the assignments are really interesting.</comment>I loved this class. There was a decent amount of work, but it was never overwhelming. Professor Sandler and the TFs were wonderful, and always enthusiastic about making sure all of the students were enjoying the class. There were so many opportunities to learn about poetry and about art in general through poetry readings, guest lecturers, museum visits, and assignments. I would recommend with high enthusiasm!</comment>1) dont take this class if you haven't had much experience with reading/writing poetry before. it is hard to do well otherwise. 2) if you want to take a course where you hope to be introduced to contemporary poetry worldwide, take this class. however, you will not learn to appreciate poetry any better after this class; you basically skim over every poet/book in 2 classes, and most of those classes are filled more with student comments than with instructional comments. if you want to learn how to appreciate/read/write poetry, take the poetry gen ed taught by helen vendler. 3) don't get maria as a tf. very harsh grader! 4) if you're looking for a light courseload-ey course, take this class! you just basically need to turn in a four page midterm, a four page final, and a portfolio where you basically mimic all the poets you read in class. there are also like four/five one page assignments but they arent graded and you can basically bs them. besides these assignments, there is no other work or any readings for the classes; you can basically show up without any reading done and still talk in class because we usually talk about short poems, and you can basically ride off what others are saying.</comment>While the teaching staff cared very deeply about this class, it was a disappointment. Only take this class if you really, really love modern poetry. The poetry that you read in this class is often abstract and bizarre and translated and can leave you just scratching your head. If you're looking for Keats, if you want Whitman or any of the classics, take Vendler's Poems Poets and Poetry. That being said, there were times when the material was interesting and the work from week to week was minimal. Do not, though, leave the portfolio until the last minute. If you choose to take this class, take advantage of Professor Sandler and the TFs offering to read any material that you send them. The commitment for this class is completely what you make of it. Just make sure that you really like reading bizarre stuff. Also, I found it very dissatisfying because retrospectively, I realize that I didn't really reach any conclusions about the poetry that we read.</comment>If you like poetry, it's a great class with not too much work involved. If you're not great at reading poetry, every class discussion breaks down the poems you're reading so you can get by with no problem. They give options for creative assignments or analytical. Professor Sandler's also brilliant!</comment>The midterm is the first graded assignment you have, so it can catch you off-guard. The grading doesn't seem to be that lenient, but you also aren't told what the class average is so it's hard to tell. Ask for feedback/help when you need or want it because the teaching staff is really helpful. You just have to take advantage of the available resources. They are all really passionate about poetry and about the course, so that makes discussing everything more enjoyable.</comment>I would tell them that this class is excellent for delivering interesting poetry, but that they need to be prepared to receive little feedback on written work, and perhaps for frustrating discussions from time to time. Like any class on literature that is open to a more general audience, and not reserved for students who are more advanced in a lit/poetry related field, some conversation will seem to read into the poems too much. This is annoying but the net value is excellent.</comment>This is an amazing course! Professor Sandler is really caring about not over-working students, and she radiates passion about the material. Additionally, we read poetry and then usually have the poet/translator come to the next class session to talk to us!</comment>If you think "Literature" cannot be bound within borders, and whether you love poetry or not, you must take this course.</comment>Poetry Without Borders is perfect for any type of student! Personally, it increased my awareness of poetry and even changed some of my views--in terms of possible concentrations. Professor Sandler is a wonderful educator, who deeply cares for her work and primarily her students. If you can take this course, do it!</comment>Be careful they are hard graders</comment>This is a great class if you're interested in poetry. I didn't really like the poetry I studied in high school but this class takes a completely different approach to it. Professor Sandler is amazing an I really enjoyed having her as my professor.</comment>This course is a great way to start appreciating poetry and the creative arts in general. If you come in with an open mind, you'll definitely get a lot out of the poems that we read in class. The teaching staff is also incredible, and the structure of the class overall is very organized and manageable.</comment>Do it. You won't regret it! Great way to fulfill this gen ed.</comment>This class is relatively easy to do, but requires that you have an authentic appreciation (or interest) in poetry; this will add more meaning to the class.</comment>This class was very interesting in section. However, the assignments were very vague sometimes and there was not a lot of direction in terms of how the papers should be written. This was hard to navigate, and they would not give you concrete feedback about your grade in the class, so you wouldn't know exactly where you stood at any point.</comment>Professor Sandler is a phenomenal lecturer, especially during the first few classes. After that, however, I kind of lost interest. I thought the class would focus on translation and interesting foreign authors, but for a nice chunk of time we talked about prison poetry (which almost bored me to tears). Many of the foreign authors we read were really interesting, but some were just so strange and (in my opinion) lackluster (Henry Parland), that they sort of discredited poetry for me.
Also, this class is not as easy as the Q guide makes it out to be. While the workload is relatively low, there are a handful of writing assignments that are sprinkled throughout the semester, almost in an arbitrary manner. Because these assignments are ungraded, it can be difficult to actually improve your writing style and your analytical tools, as there's little incentive, and the comments on assignments can be difficult to figure out (both because it's hard to read the TF's handwriting, and the comments are written in a very poetic way that makes it difficult to understand the meaning). Marton and Maria can be very harsh graders, but when you meet with them (at least, Marton) they will tell you they liked your paper but not really give you a good reason as to why you got a B/B+ on it.</comment>This is a hard class.  The workload is low, but that does not mean it is easy.  This class made me really dislike some of my classmates, you'll find class and section is take over by hardos wanting to get their brilliant ideas in.</comment>Wonderful teaching staff. Stephanie Sandler and Maria Vassileva are so knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the course material, as well as very kind people. They understand that AI11 is probably not your top priority, which is something rare at a school were so many professors assign and teach as if their course was the only course you were taking / the only one that mattered. They understand that people are probably not doing all the readings (and the good thing about taking a poetry class is that you can kind of do the reading during class.... shhh....), and the assignments, while never dumb, were light and fun. You always have a choice on what to write on, and often you also have a choice between creative and analytical, so you'll be able to find something to write about that interests you! 

Contemporary poetry is harder than you think to read and appreciate. You will learn so much about how to read and make sense of it, and, if you're like me, you'll also learn how to use language and art to express yourself and think about things in ways you never did before. I was a reader writer before, but this course definitely made me grow as one in ways that even English and Creative Writing courses at Harvard didn't.</comment>Fun anecdote: when Harvard removed difficulty ratings from the Q Guide, UC members shopped this class in protest, which is why a 14-person class quadrupled in size. The best part of this story (and the takeaway), however, is that most of the people who shopped it as a joke ended up staying. Stephanie Sandler is a wonderful teacher and takes care of every student in the class - even if it's 40 people, it doesn't feel like you're ever lost in lecture. You also get to do so many different things in class: you'll have real live in-the-flesh poets come visit and talk about the work they do. You'll get to go to the Harvard Museum of Natural History and write about the gigantic dinosaur skeleton. You'll get to read and write some really awesome work and you will feel genuinely proud of it (given, of course, that you invest some care and effort). I'm leaving this course with more questions than answers, personally, but I feel happy about the conversations I had, the work I did, and the new-found appreciation for language I am taking away.</comment>Buy all the books at the very beginning, and do the readings. They're enjoyable, so why not?</comment>This is one of the BEST classes I've taken at Harvard. With very little poetry background and just a lot of interest, I feel like I learned so much and really got to explore something I became passionate about. It also doesn't overwhelm you with work. If you like poetry even a little bit, you will love this course. TAKE THIS CLASS!</comment>If you really enjoy poetry, it'll provoke lots of interesting discussions that will broaden your ability to think analytically about literature.</comment>Really great learning experience. Make sure to participate in class.</comment>This was an awesome introduction into modern poetry.</comment>This is a wonderful course to learn interesting facets of poetry that are not likely explored in other, more traditional poetry courses. If you are interested in completing open-ended assignments on things such as ekphrasis, translation, and the art of language itself then definitely take the class. Professor Sandler does an amazing job at making every "lecture" engaging; however, do be warned about the many hours you will spend in class itself and how unclear many of the expectations for the course are. In addition, the TFs do little to help prepare you for the major assignments such as the take-home midterms and finals.</comment>This class is great because it exposes you to poets that you likely will never otherwise discover/encounter.  The downside of this is that some of these poets are extremely difficult/bizarre--but the teaching staff is really dedicated to helping you discover the value in working through difficult poetry like this.  Also, the fact that so many of the poets/translators in the syllabus come into class to talk is pretty amazing.  If nothing else, I'd recommend this class for the opportunity to hear Valzhyna Mort speak--I'd never read her poetry before, but I'm now absolutely in love with it.  She is one of the coolest people I've ever heard speak.</comment></course>TIBET 104ar: Elementary Colloquial Tibetan</title>I would advise future students to take advantage of the fact that Shoko Mekata is enthusiastic about having conversations in Tibetan whether in class or outside of that. So you will have as much speaking practice as you want.</comment></course>PSY 971: Contemporary Issues in Psychology: Intensive Cross-level Analyses</title>This class is essential to the psychology concentration. It is a lot of reading and writing but it is very informative and easily holds interest.</comment>It is difficult but really interesting and helpful.</comment>It is a lot of work, but if you do the readings and participate in the class, it is really interesting. I had a great tutorial experience, but this could be due to how excellent my section leader was.</comment>This is a fantastic introduction to scholarly writing in psychology. The writing skills you gain in this course are extremely helpful for outside research and even papers in other courses. Of all the courses I've taken at Harvard, including my excellent expos class, this class actually improved my writing. Julia is the department writing fellow and her comments were always extremely helpful in the writing process.</comment>Ton of reading that could probably be slimmed down because you are never tested on the material. Mostly busy work that can be annoying on a weekly basis but not hard material. Great feedback on the paper while writing it, and it is easy to improve.</comment>It was a great class and I really enjoyed it.</comment>Yes</comment>Fantastic course! It was great for walking us through each step of writing a really good paper and understanding/analyzing methods. The readings were a fun sampling of different areas of psychology. Samuel Ronfard is the best TF!</comment>Take it as long as you can get Julia cause Julia is a boss.</comment>This class will teach you how to think like a psychologist, express your ideas, and engage with other opinions. It will not teach you much about psychology itself.</comment>This class can be a lot of work depending on how much work you do and how much you pace yourself. One of the most helpful aspects of this class was that you wrote your final paper in parts which really helps you reflect and build upon your work and maximize your sophomore essay, essentially the capstone of this class. Discussions can be very interesting and you get great idea of how to critically read psychology articles.</comment>Make sure to do all readings closely as it will provide a better experience in sections.</comment></course>LATIN 104: Ovid's Metamorphoses</title>I don't know if this class is being offered again, but I'll comment as though it is. Practical things first, before I gush: if you want to enjoy and get the most out of this class, be prepared to read a lot of Latin--150 lines a night minimum. And as a result, you should also expect that exams, though they are very fair, will take a long time to study for (there were 3000 lines of Latin to review for the final!)  Ok, now I get to gush. Ovid's poetry is beautiful and a pleasure to read. But what really made me love this class was the opportunity to learn from Professor Tarrant. He is the best college professor I have ever had and one of the best educators I've ever known. His ability to effortlessly guide and supplement discussion in class, without even making you feel like he's doing it, is totally awe-inspiring. He takes you to profound ideas and makes you feel like you've gotten there all by yourself. Outside of the classroom, Professor Tarrant is simply a gem: such a good listener, so willing to help with everything from the most tedious translation questions to discussions about papers and next-semester plans. His rigor, patience and delight in the text will make you find the Latin so much more beautiful than you could ever have done without his help. No matter what he is teaching, you should take every chance you get to study with this great and good man.</comment>I used to be a fan of Vergil but slowly moved to being more of a fan of Ovid. This class definitely solidified that for me. Professor Tarrant is great. Take classes with him.</comment>Take it if you are ready to put in the work of translating the poem. It may be too much for a more inexperienced Latin student.</comment>The readings aren't always possible to get done depending on how much other work you have. Make sure to read the emails Professor Tarrant sends out in order to make sure you read the most important passages.</comment>Professor Tarrant is a master with Ovid. The discussions are fantastic.</comment>Professor Tarrant's lectures are always insightful and intriguing. I always looked forward to going to class and to reading the different myths in Ovid. Take the class!</comment>Professor Tarrant is amazing!  Take a course with him.  The reading is a lot and hard to keep up with, but the course is worth it!</comment>Be ready for a quick reading pace. Tarrant is very good in the classroom and is the world's expert on Ovid, so this is a fantastic way to get one of your 100-level Latin courses out of the way.</comment>This course is a great middle between something like Latin Ba or Ac and a Latin 112. You are doing 500-700 lines of latin a week, which requires a fair bit of time, but the stories are super engaging. And Professor Tarrant knows his Ovid in and out. He also is always good about students inputting their own thoughts. And the exams will cover thousands of line, but Tarrant makes sure not to try to trip you up with obscure passages.</comment>Professor Tarrant is an excellent teacher and "Metamorphoses" is his bread and butter. Take it.</comment></course>ENG-SCI 164: Environmental Chemistry</title>Be prepared to decipher the textbook</comment>The material was very interesting, but the course is a little overwhelming if you don't have a strong chemistry background. The course requires a lot of work outside the class (I wasn't really able to finish a problem set without going to office hours). That being said, the teaching staff is very willing to help as long as you put in the extra time. Prof McKinney is a great teacher who wants everyone to understand the material.</comment>Simply put, this is a terrible class. Despite having a 100-level number and a prerequisite, this class spends most of its time going very slowly over basic concepts. Even when you do learn new things, no attempt is made for students to gain insight into the fundamental concepts or develop physical intuition for the chemical processes. Instead, the focus is on formulaic approaches to calculating values to get answers to contrived problems. This class felt to me far like a dumbed-down high school class, despite the fact that it masquerades as a 100-level college class.   This is without a doubt the worst class I have taken at Harvard, and the only one that I actively dislike going to. My classmates and I have literally been counting down the days of class left for the last few weeks of the semester.  Do not take this class.</comment>It is interesting. The final project is awesome, you get to do a lot of cool things. Just stay on top of the work and go to section and you're good.</comment>This class was a great way to learn chemistry. It's relevant since it is focused on environmental chemistry, and it's well organize because it follows a [well-written] textbook. I felt that the psets and midterms were very fair. Karena really cares about the course, and takes the time to make videos of examples to help you learn the more calculative-side of the course. This also makes it easy to review for the tests.   Also, if Jordan is still the TF, he's the best!! Jordan may be one of the few TFs I've had here that knows more than just what is on the psets, and is able to teach it well.</comment>95% of the course covers chemical equilibria.  Honestly focuses on all of the meticulously derived, less exciting concepts of chemistry.  That being said it does fullfill a requirement, the labs are fairly painless, psets take between 6-10 hours, tests are difficult.</comment>This is a great class. Karena, Jordan, and Caroline are all incredibly helpful and nice. You see the material on assignments, tests, and labs, so there's a lot of reinforcement. The environmental applications are fascinating.</comment>AMAZING instructors, great material. This course is one of the most useful and interesting courses I have taken at Harvard. Definitely worth your time.</comment>This class was extremely interesting and well taught. Karena is amazing and makes the class very enjoyable. It is a tough class with high level learning and hard psets. Although the labs and psets balance out nicely to only have one assignment a week. For the EPS people who are taking this as your only chem class, it will be tough, so ideally having some type of chem background or spending more time to learn the basics will help a lot. Still take this class over any other option:)</comment>It's a course that will challenge you to think about chemistry in a very intuitive manner</comment>This class was definitely not easy, even if you had a very robust chemistry background. The lectures are easy to understand but the exams and the problem sets take a significant amount of time. Just know what you're getting into if this is a concentration credit and make your schedule accordingly. The project at the end is very manageable if you have a good group and a topic that interests you.</comment></course>CHNSHIS 225r: Topics in Song History: Seminar</title>Bol is incredibly inspiring and you will learn a lot about Chinese history and think about it the way you never did. But don't even bother if you don't want to spend 10 hours every week reading classical chinese.</comment>We learned to apply digital humanities into the study of local history and a lot about the local elite in Jinhua from the 12th to the 16th centuries.</comment></course>MUSIC 280r: Theorizing Improvisation</title>This course will change the way you think about music and living.</comment>Lots and lots of work, but very, very worth it</comment>This is a rigorous course that takes students through a formidable body of literature, in music studies, black studies, critical theory, and much more. The readings and discussions are challenging and productive to new ways of thinking and questioning. The professor has a strong command of and devotion to the material.</comment>fantastic overview of many subjects relevant to improvisation. Lots of reading you will likely want to come back to later, not enough time to thoroughly process them throughout the semester.</comment></course>FRENCH 30: Advanced Language Review</title>The syllabus was often frustrating for me to understand, but the instructor was excellent - I found myself laughing a lot during class! Which was a joy.</comment>Prepare yourself for quite a bit of homework, and for some students to seem more fluent than the recommended level. Classes are fun though, and the subject matter is interesting.</comment>This was one of my least favorite classes at Harvard. The material was time-consuming and not very engaging. Your French will definitely improve, but this is a somewhat painful ways to do so.</comment>Take this class - never will your tongue have been more seductively charged.</comment>Be on top of it because once you fall behind, it's difficult to catch up.</comment>Very rewarding class, especially if you can practice speaking outside of class with a French friend or with your TF in office hours. It's all about verbal practice and participation!</comment>it is a good course if you are seeking a french citation</comment>Matthieu is a wonderful TF who is very willing to help students, as long as they put in the effort. This course does require a certain amount of work outside of class. As long as you keep up with the grammar exercises and learn the vocabulary, you should be more than prepared for the quizzes. Class discussion is enjoyable and Matthieu encourages participation from everyone. Overall, this course was an enjoyable way to review French language.</comment>This really is a great class if you're starting French here at Harvard (assuming you've taken it before). Personally, I did not take French my senior year and was a little rusty, so this class was perfect. It gives you a throughout review of French grammar, spaced out throughout the semester, so you don't feel overwhelmed. I really enjoyed this class!</comment>This class is a pain. Your homework exercises, where you're supposed to write paragraphs in French on readings and other media, turn into an exercise in listing grammatical constructions in order to fulfill the constraints in the assignment. The scheduling of assignments is nonsensical, so you should probably look ahead in the syllabus over the weekend and not only do the (very short, especially since you have the whole weekend to do it) Tuesday homework, but also the (much longer in spite of only having two days to do it) Thursday homework. Also beware; there are a lot of projects starting in November, that are with partners, so you'll be busy, even around Harvard-yale weekend and Thanksgiving. And be sure to clarify assignments from the syllabus with your teacher, since sometimes it will be wrong or different from what they want. Really be wary of the syllabus in general, since it can be formatted or phrased deceptively, and you might miss readings/viewings for a class period. Other than these organizational flaws, it is a decent way to practice speaking French for 3 hours a week, and to review grammar (which for this class you should be pretty familiar with standard topics).</comment>I took this course because I was really passionate about learning French. But after this course, I don't even want to take another French course. Be prepared for about five large assignments in two weeks at the end of the semester (while you are trying to study during reading period and the last week of classes). The topics in class are boring, and I really really really really really regret taking this class. It was horrible.</comment>French 30 is a wonderful class. If one looks for a low-stress way to improve one's French in a supportive and fun environment, French 30 will address one's needs excellently. Please actually want to speak French though! Franck was an amazing teacher- cheerful, open and helpful.</comment>I loved this class - we had a hilarious section group. The continuing patience of our TF in correcting our mangled French was amazing. My speaking and writing improved greatly. The only reservation I have is that this class had an incredible amount of work, which is not a problem in itself - there's no easy way around language learning - but sometimes the specific tasks seemed unnecessarily difficult (for example, writing a grammar composition using 10 different kinds of negation, but while giving a plausible opinion on some article about French teenagers using Facebook…).</comment>It's great to have a class focused on oral expression, but know that graded assignments still heavily skew towards written and grammar-based work. This felt contradictory, and I wish there had been more oral expression outside of class.</comment></course>SOC-STD 98ab: Science and Democracy in Modern America</title>Small seminar style class on the intersection of democracy and science. You really gain a new perspective of science throughout history and its interactions with politics and society. I took this class as a non-Social Studies concentrator and still found the readings and discussions engaging. There are about 4-5 readings every week along with weekly responses -- fairly manageable. There is one research essay on a topic of your choice, which I found enjoyable to write. Prof. Jewett leads great discussions and also provides good feedback on essays.</comment></course>CHNSE 163: Business Chinese</title>This class is amazing. It requires a lot of work, but if you've been taking the 120, 130, and/or 140 series, it should be about on par with what those classes expect of you. Sun Laoshi is so kind and caring</comment>Try to use the vocabulary as much as possible in presentations, papers, and on exams.</comment></course>
